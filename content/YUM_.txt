franchise agreements 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises the company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment capability and capitalization to grow our concepts franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies the company has franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business such as our relationships with yum china defined below and our strategic alliance with food delivery brands group sa previously named telepizza group sa who is the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america excluding brazil as well as portions of europe and our relationships with certain other large franchisees 

the company has successfully increased franchise restaurant ownership in recent years and currently has approximately 1500 franchisees with whom we have franchise contracts the company utilizes both storelevel franchise and master franchise programs to grow our businesses of our over 52000 franchised units at december 31 2021 approximately 30 operate under our master franchise programs including nearly 10800 units in mainland china the remainder of our franchise units operate under storelevel franchise agreements under both types of franchise programs franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business in certain historical refranchising transactions the company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee storelevel franchise agreements typically require payment to the company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants’ sales typically between 4 to 6 and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand under master franchise arrangements the company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as subfranchise restaurants within certain geographic territories master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties 

with regard to the oversight of subfranchisees in exchange master franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the subfranchisees under their franchise agreements and typically pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate 

on october 31 2016 we completed the spinoff of our china business into an independent publiclytraded company under the name of yum china holdings inc “yum china” as our largest master franchisee yum china pays the company a continuing fee of 3 on system sales of our concepts in mainland china the use by yum china of certain of our material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between yum restaurants consulting shanghai company limited “yccl” a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of yum china and yum through yri china franchising llc a subsidiary of yum 

the company seeks to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards 

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants “qsr” traditional units can feature dinein carryout drivethru and delivery services nontraditional units include express units that have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in carryout food andor have the concepts food delivered either through storelevel or thirdparty delivery services in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut and habit burger grill offer a drivethru option on a much more limited basis 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches where sufficient scale allows area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants 

our restaurant operations and results were significantly impacted by a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021 as covid19 spread throughout the us and the rest of the world governmental authorities implemented measures to reduce the spread of covid19 these measures include restrictions on travel outside the home and have other limitations on business and other activities as well as encouraging social distancing as a result of covid19 we and our franchisees have experienced significant store closures and instances of reduced storelevel operations including reduced operating hours and diningroom closures we and our franchisees have also experienced interruptions of food and other supplies as well as labor shortages that have impacted restaurant operations 

the impact on our sales in each of our markets has been dependent on the timing severity and duration of the outbreak measures implemented by government authorities to reduce the spread of covid19 as well as our reliance on dinein sales in the market in response we accelerated our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience and our offpremise capabilities this included increasing our focus on driving digital sales where customers utilize ordering interaction that is primarily facilitated by automated technology for our restaurants that prominently feature drivethru carryout and delivery options covid19 has in many cases contributed to an increase in sales during 2020 and 2021 in 2021 our system restaurants generated digital sales of 22 billion which represented an approximate 25 increase over 2020 additionally the number of restaurants that now offer delivery increased to over 45000 restaurants which represents over 85 of our global system more than a 25 increase over 2020 

supply and distribution 

the company and franchisees of the concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done in practice the company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these supplies are generally available 

in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc taco bell and pizza hut franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs” a third party which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment additionally the habit burger grill entered into a purchasing agreement with rscs effective july 31 2020 the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with our franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane foodservice inc is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee restaurants outside the us we and our concepts’ franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors our international franchisees generally select and manage their own thirdparty suppliers and distributors subject to our internal standards all suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products andor services that comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations in the state andor country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards 

advertising and promotional programs 

companyowned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants’ sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the concepts advertising may be conducted nationally regionally and locally when multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and companyowned restaurants if any contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants’ sales the contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising market research commercial production talent payments and other support functions for the respective concepts we have the right to control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives typically in markets where we have companyowned restaurants through our majority voting rights 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including our kentucky fried chicken® kfc® taco bell® pizza hut® and the habit® marks have significant value and material importance to our business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks 

the use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in our marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not currently considered material to our business

information about the company’s working capital is included in mda in part ii item 7 and the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

seasonal operations 

the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree 

competition 

the retail food industry in which our concepts compete is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including those in the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties competition has also increased from and been enabled by delivery aggregators and other food delivery services in recent years particularly in urbanized areas which trend has accelerated following the onset of the covid19 pandemic our concepts also face competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power within the retail food industry each of our concepts competes with international national and regional chains as well as locallyowned establishments not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on our operations due to possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2021 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated

risk factors  

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements expectations and historical trends any of the following risk factors either by itself or together with other risk factors could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

risks related to covid19 food safety and catastrophic events 

the novel coronavirus covid19 global pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

developments related to covid19 which was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations the impacts of covid19 have included the loss of revenues due to store closures reduced storelevel operations full or partial dining room closures and other restrictions on our business and operations during 2021 the overall adverse impact of covid19 on our operations was less significant than in 2020 but we continued to see negative impacts as of the end of 2021 due to covid19 outbreaks and resulting government restrictions limiting mobility in certain parts of the world primarily in asia 

conversely for our restaurants that prominently feature drivethru carryout and delivery options the pandemic has in many cases contributed to an increase in sales since the onset of the pandemic if the impact of the pandemic continues to recede and the restaurant industry in general returns to more normal operations the benefits to sales experienced by certain of our restaurants including our pizza hut delivery restaurants could wane and our results could be negatively impacted 

we and our franchisees have made operational changes intended to safeguard employees and customers in response to covid19 which have included increased cleaning and sanitization installation of counter screens and the purchase of personal protective equipment these operational changes have increased and may continue to increase restaurant operating costs and impact restaurantlevel margins and return on invested capital our and our franchisees’ restaurants have also experienced and may continue to experience interruptions of food and other supplies as well as labor shortages in addition the covid19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to implement certain precautionary measures such as in relation to vaccinations testing and face coverings which could adversely impact our operations employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to visit our restaurants 

our success is heavily reliant on our concepts’ franchisees and the covid19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause financial distress for certain franchisees particularly those located in areas most significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of this distress certain of our franchisees have been unable to or in the future may be unable to meet their financial obligations to us as they come due including the payment of royalties rent or other amounts due to the company additionally certain of our franchisees have been unable to or in the future may be unable to make payments to landlords distributors and key suppliers as well as payments to service any debt they may have outstanding franchisee financial distress has also led to and may continue to lead to permanent store closures and delayed or reduced new franchisee development which may further harm our results and liquidity 

we are unable to fully predict the impact that covid19 will have on our and our franchisees’ operations going forward due to various uncertainties including the severity and duration of the pandemic the timing availability acceptance and effectiveness 

of medical treatments and vaccines the spread of potentially more contagious andor virulent forms of covid19 including variants that may be more resistant to currently available vaccines and treatments the extent to which covid19 may cause customers to continue to be reluctant to return to inrestaurant dining or otherwise change their consumption patterns including after the covid19 pandemic has ended actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and the extent to which ongoing governmental restrictions in certain regions will be lifted and the ongoing impact of the pandemic on economic conditions in the us and globally moreover if conditions related to the covid19 pandemic result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets or negatively impact our credit ratings our cost of borrowing our ability to access capital on favorable terms and our overall liquidity and capital structure could be adversely impacted 

food safety and food or beverageborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli listeria salmonella cyclospora and trichinosis and food safety issues such as food tampering contamination including with respect to allergens and adulteration or food or beverageborne illness occur or may occur within our system from time to time furthermore due to the covid19 pandemic there are now stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts’ restaurants or linking our competitors or the retail food industry generally to instances of food or beverageborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect us and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation governmental investigations or actions and damages moreover the reliance of our concepts’ restaurants on thirdparty food suppliers and distributors and increasing reliance on food delivery aggregators increases the risk that food or beverageborne illness incidents and food safety issues could be caused by factors outside of our direct control if a customer of one of our concepts’ restaurants becomes ill from food or beverageborne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which could disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business in addition instances or allegations of food or beverageborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or our suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect either our or our concepts’ franchisees’ revenues and profits the occurrence of food or beverageborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

our business may be adversely affected by catastrophic or unforeseen events such as future health epidemics or pandemics natural disasters and events that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings 

our business could be materially and adversely impacted by various future occurrences which may be beyond our control including future health epidemics or pandemics natural disasters geopolitical events terrorism political financial or social instability boycotts social or civil unrest workplace violence or other events that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our and our concepts restaurants for example the outbreak of a widespread future health epidemic or pandemic including an outbreak arising from various strains of avian flu or swine flu such as h1n1 particularly if located in regions from which we derive a significant amount of revenue or profit could materially and adversely affect our business 

in addition our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu or other illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities prior outbreaks of avian flu have resulted in confirmed human cases and it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products which would adversely affect us as the result of the fact that poultry is a menu offering for our concepts’ restaurants avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact profit margins and revenues for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

furthermore other viruses may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures impose restrictions on operations of restaurants or restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and operating results 

risks related to our business strategy and reliance upon franchisees 

our operating results and growth strategies are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

the vast majority 98 of our restaurants are operated by our concepts’ franchisees our refranchising efforts have increased our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our concepts’ franchisees in addition our longterm growth depends on maintaining the pace of our net system unit growth rate through our concepts’ franchisees we also rely on master franchisees who have rights to license to subfranchisees the right to develop and operate restaurants to achieve our expectations for new unit development if our concepts’ franchisees and master franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development we may not achieve our desired growth 

we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased fees paid to us for royalties advertising funds contributions and other discrete services we may provide to our concept’s franchisees  eg management of ecommerce platforms our control is further limited in markets where we utilize master franchise arrangements which require us to rely on our master franchisees to monitor and enforce subfranchisee compliance with our operating standards if our concepts’ franchisees fail to adequately capitalize their businesses or incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in their financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy or the inability to meet development targets or obligations if a significant franchisee of one of our concepts becomes or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees in the aggregate become financially distressed which has occurred with certain of our franchisees as the result of the covid19 pandemic our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed fee payments that cause us to record bad debt expense reduced advertising fund contributions and reduced new unit development 

in addition we are secondarily liable on certain of our concepts’ franchisees’ restaurant lease agreements including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with the refranchising of certain companyowned restaurants our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties to the extent our concepts’ franchisees default on such lease agreements in addition the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to attract and retain quality personnel or adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and the development of new restaurants which in turn could hurt our business 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our concepts’ franchisees to implement marketing programs and major initiatives such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades which may require financial investment by such franchisees our concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the company 

additionally the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to focus on key elements of restaurant operations such as compliance with our operating standards addressing quality service and cleanliness even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents may be attributed by guests to our concepts’ entire brand and could have a negative impact on our business moreover franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our concepts’ brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards including with respect to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines in connection with the covid19 pandemic engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices 

we have franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business such as our relationship with yum china in connection with the spinoff of our china business in 2016 into an independent publiclytraded company the “separation” or “yum china spinoff” we entered into a master license agreement pursuant to which yum china is the exclusive licensee of the kfc taco bell and pizza hut concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in mainland china following the separation yum china became and continues to be our largest franchisee our financial results are significantly affected by yum china’s results as we are entitled to receive a 3 salesbased royalty on all yum china system sales related to these concepts 

in addition to yum china we have other significant franchise relationships on which our success is dependent including our strategic alliance with food delivery brands group sa previously named telepizza group sa “telepizza” which is the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america excluding brazil and portions of europe and our relationship with certain other large franchisees any failure to realize the expected benefits of such franchise relationships may adversely impact our business and operating results 

we may not achieve our target development goals including as the result of the covid19 pandemic and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to increase the number of restaurants around the world the successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand into new markets internationally and we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees including yum china will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably consistent with results of existing restaurants or consistent with our or our franchisees’ expectations other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and trade or economic policies or sanctions our ability to attract new franchisees construction and development costs of new restaurants and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations access capital on favorable terms obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified management teams and restaurant crews and meet construction schedules 

expansion into markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ willingness to invest capital or ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants or if the perceived return on invested capital is not sufficiently attractive the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the development of new restaurants could impact the sales of our concepts’ existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from past or potential future acquisitions investments or other strategic transactions 

from time to time we evaluate and may complete mergers acquisitions divestitures joint ventures strategic partnerships minority investments which may include minority investments in third parties such as franchisees or master franchisees and other strategic transactions including our acquisition of dragontail systems limited completed in september 2021 and our acquisition of the habit restaurants inc completed in march 2020 

past and potential future strategic transactions may involve various inherent risks including without limitation 

• expenses delays or difficulties in integrating acquired companies joint venture operations strategic partnerships or investments into our organization including the failure to realize expected synergies andor the inability to retain key personnel 

• diversion of management’s attention from other initiatives andor daytoday operations to effectively execute our growth strategy 

• inability to generate sufficient revenue profit and cash flow from acquired companies joint ventures strategic partnerships or investments 

• the possibility that we have acquired substantial contingent or unanticipated liabilities in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and 

• the possibility that investments we have made may decline significantly in value which could lead to the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquired businesses 

past and potential future strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we account for certain investments including our investment in devyani international limited “devyani” on a marktomarket basis and as a result changes in the fair value of these investments impact our reported results changes in market prices for equity securities are unpredictable and our investment in devyani has caused and could continue to cause fluctuations in our results of operations 

risks related to operating a global business 

we have significant exposure to the chinese market through our largest franchisee yum china which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our total business particularly with respect to our kfc concept is conducted in mainland china through our largest franchisee yum china yum china’s business is exposed to risks in mainland china which include among others potential political financial and social instability changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences the regulatory environment including uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws rules and regulations food safety related matters including compliance with food safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety and the effect of the covid19 pandemic and related restrictions in china any significant or prolonged deterioration in us–china relations including as the result of current us–china tensions could adversely affect our concepts in mainland china chinese law regulates yum china’s business conducted within mainland china our royalty income from the yum china business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on chinese laws regulations and policies as they may change from time to time if yum china’s business is harmed or development of our concepts’ restaurants is slowed in mainland china due to any of these factors it could negatively impact the royalty paid by yum china to us which would negatively impact our financial results or our growth prospects 

our relationship with yum china is governed primarily by a master license agreement which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of yum china in addition if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in mainland china if yum china is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the master license agreement or if the master license agreement is otherwise terminated it could result in an interruption in the operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to yum china for use in mainland china such interruption could cause a delay in or loss of royalty income to us which would negatively impact our financial results 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us including in emerging markets and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business and the businesses of our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political financial or social instability or conditions geopolitical events corruption antiamerican sentiment social and ethnic unrest military conflicts and terrorism as well as changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights income and nonincome based tax rates and laws additional risks include the impact of import restrictions or controls sanctions foreign exchange control regimes including restrictions on currency conversion health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid19 pandemic labor costs and conditions compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our concepts’ restaurants are operated for example we have been subject to a regulatory enforcement action in india alleging violation of foreign exchange laws for failure to satisfy conditions of certain operating approvals such as minimum investment and store build requirements as well as limitations on the remittance of fees outside of the country see note 20 in addition escalating tensions between russia and ukraine and any potential military incursion of russia into ukraine could adversely impact macroeconomic conditions give rise to regional instability and result in heightened economic sanctions from the us and the international community in a manner that adversely affects us and our concepts’ restaurants located in russia and eastern europe including to the extent that any such sanctions restrict our ability in this region to conduct business with certain suppliers or vendors andor to utilize the banking system and repatriate cash we and our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages the imposition of penalties suspension of business licenses or a cessation of operations at our or our franchisees’ businesses as well as damage to our and our concepts’ brands’ images and reputations 

foreign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results 

our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi “rmb” australian dollar the british pound and the euro as well as currencies in certain 

other markets such as the malaysian ringgit and russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings any significant fluctuation in the value of currencies of countries in which we or our franchisees operate and in particular rmb in china could materially impact the us dollar value of royalty payments made to us which could result in lower revenues in addition fluctuations in the value of currencies in which we or our franchisees operate could lead to increased costs and lower profitability to us or our franchisees andor cause us or our franchisees to increase prices to customers which could negatively impact sales in these markets and harm our financial condition and operating results there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition the governments in certain countries where our concepts operate including china restrict the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of the country restrictions on the conversion of rmb to us dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of china could result in delays in the remittance of yum china’s royalty which could impact our liquidity 

risks related to technology data privacy and intellectual property 

any cybersecurity incident including the failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees or the introduction of malware or ransomware could materially affect our business and result in substantial costs litigation reputational harm and a loss of consumer confidence 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees vendors and franchisees in addition our vendors andor franchisees receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our vendors employees and customers the use and handling including security of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts and industry standards 

we have experienced cyberattacks and security breaches from time to time the number and frequency of these cyberattacks andor security breaches varies but could be exacerbated by an increase in the use of our digital commerce platforms furthermore the significant increase in remote working as the result of the covid19 pandemic which may continue following the pandemic could increase the risks of cyber incidents and the improper dissemination of personal or confidential information if our security and information systems or those of businesses with which we interact are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss a cyberattack or a network security incident or if our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or fail to meet industry standards and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties damage our brands and reputation cause interruption of normal business performance cause us to incur substantial costs result in a loss of consumer confidence and sales and disrupt our supply chain business and plans additionally such events could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and could subject us to litigation and government enforcement actions the losses associated with which may not be covered by insurance moreover any significant cybersecurity events could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by such events interfere with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives and cause us to incur additional expenditures which could be material including to investigate such events remedy cybersecurity problems recover lost data prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices in response to such events there is no assurance that any remedial actions will meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

further the standards for systems currently used for transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions and the technology utilized in electronic payment transactions all of which can put electronic payment data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us if we or our franchisees fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card and debit card transactions or to comply with the payment card industry data security standards we or our franchisees may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures fines and assessments from the card brands and significantly higher credit card and debit card related costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with data privacy and data protection legal requirements may adversely affect our business and subject us to penalties 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees do business for example we are subject to numerous global laws including the general data protection regulation “gdpr” applicable to the processing of personal data in the european union which was adopted by the european union effective may 2018 and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and is subject to changing requirements each of which could increase company and franchisee resources necessary to comply in addition the state of california enacted the california consumer 

privacy act the “ccpa” which became effective january 2020 requiring companies that process information on california residents to among other things provide new disclosures and options to consumers about data collection use and sharing practices further the ccpa has been subject to revision and amendments including significant modifications made by the california privacy rights act “cpra” under which the majority of requirements will take effect january 1 2023 the updates and modifications to the ccpa as well as requirements under the gdpr and other newly enacted and evolving legal requirements may require us and our franchisees to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply moreover each of the gdpr and the ccpa confer a private rightofaction to certain individuals and associations and the cpra will fund the creation of a regulatory body enforcing its provisions 

in addition several other states have introduced data privacy legislation which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection use and processing activities the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection use dissemination and security of data the federal trade commission will also pursue privacy as a dedicated enforcement priority with specialized attorneys seeking violation of us privacy laws including unfair or deceptive practices relating to privacy policies consumer data collection and processing consent and digital advertising practices furthermore various other international jurisdictions where our concepts have operations have significantly strengthened their data privacy laws rules and regulations new crossborder data transfer requirements will require us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply and may impact the transfer of personal data throughout our organization and to third parties 

the increasingly restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may require significant effort and cost require changes to our business practices and impact our ability to obtain and use data used to provide a personalized experience for customers of our concepts’ restaurants in addition failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us and our franchisees to fines sanctions governmental investigation lawsuits and other potential liability as well as reputational harm 

unreliable or inefficient restaurant or consumerfacing technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives in the future could adversely impact operating results and the overall consumer experience 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely heavily on information technology systems in the conduct of our business some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including for example pointofsale processing in our restaurants management of our supply chain and various other processes and procedures these systems are subject to damage interruption or failure due to theft fire power outages telecommunications failure computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks including the introduction of malware or ransomware or other disruptive behavior by hackers or other catastrophic events certain technology systems may also be unreliable or inefficient and technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance which could impact the reliability of critical systems’ operations if our or our concepts’ franchisees’ information technology systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales customer or employee dissatisfaction or negative publicity that could adversely impact our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience sales growth and margin improvement our continued growth will be dependent on our initiatives to implement proprietary and thirdparty technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience it may be difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts due to intense competition for qualified technology systems’ developers necessary to innovate develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives including increasing our digital relationship with customers our strategic digital and technology initiatives may not be implemented in a timely manner or may not achieve the desired results even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives there is no guarantee that this will result in sales growth or margin improvement additionally developing and implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us and our concepts’ franchisees and our concepts franchisees may have differing views on investment priorities moreover our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological advancements and industry trends particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities could result in a loss of customers and related market share if our concepts’ digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security speed attractiveness or ease of use customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms which could negatively impact our business 

we cannot predict the impact that alternative methods of delivery including autonomous vehicle delivery or changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these alternative methods of delivery will have on our business advances in alternative methods of delivery including advances in digital ordering technology or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position 

moreover technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future we may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model however we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business 

there are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms to maintain and grow sales 

customers are increasingly using ecommerce websites and apps both domestically and internationally such as kfccom tacobellcom pizzahutcom habitburgercom kfc taco bell pizza hut and the habit burger grill apps and apps owned by thirdparty delivery aggregators and thirdparty mobile payment processors to order and pay for our concepts’ products moreover the covid19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the use of storelevel or thirdparty delivery services by our concepts many restaurants in each of our concepts now offer consumers the ability to have the concept’s food delivered through thirdparty delivery services as a result our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel and our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement execute or maintain our consumerfacing digital initiatives such as curbside pickup and mobile carryout if the thirdparty aggregators that we utilize for delivery including marketplace and delivery as a service cease or curtail their operations fail to maintain sufficient labor force to satisfy demand materially change fees access or visibility to our products or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors our business may be negatively impacted these digital ordering and payment platforms also could be damaged or interrupted by power loss technological failures user errors cyberattacks other forms of sabotage inclement weather or natural disasters the digital ordering platforms relied upon by our concepts have experienced interruptions and could experience further interruptions which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms or make customers less inclined to return to such platforms the rapid acceleration in growth of digital sales has placed additional stress on those platforms that are more reliant upon legacy technology such as certain platforms used by pizza hut which may result in more frequent and potentially more severe interruptions moreover our reliance on multiple digital commerce platforms to support our global footprint multiple concepts and highly franchised business model could increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks andor security breaches and could necessitate additional expenditures as we endeavor to consolidate and standardize such platforms 

yum china our largest franchisee utilizes thirdparty mobile payment apps such as alipay and wechat pay as a means through which to generate sales and process payments should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in china should the relationship between yum china and one or more thirdparty mobile payment processors become interrupted or should yum china’s ability to use wechat pay alipay or other thirdparty mobile payment apps in its operations be restricted its business could be materially and adversely affected which could have a negative impact on the royalty paid to us 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the increased impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other branddamaging behaviors many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

in addition social media is frequently used by our concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general failure by our concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately particularly as compared to our concepts’ respective competitors could lead to a decline in brand value customer visits and revenue social media is also increasingly used to compel companies to express public positions on issues and topics not directly related to their core business which could prove controversial or divisive to consumers and result in lost sales or a misallocation of resources in addition laws and regulations including federal trade commission enforcement are rapidly evolving to govern social media platforms and communications a failure of us our employees our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our concepts’ brands our reputation and our business or subject us or our franchisees to fines or other penalties other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts’ brands exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our 

customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property could harm our concepts’ brands and overall business 

we regard our registered trademarks eg yum® kfc® taco bell® pizza hut® and the habit® and unregistered trademarks and other trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts our trademarks many of which are registered in the us and foreign jurisdictions create brand awareness and help build goodwill among our customers 

we rely on a combination of legal protections provided by trademark registrations contracts copyrights patents and common law rights such as unfair competition passing off and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property from potential infringement however from time to time we become aware of other persons or companies using names and marks that are identical or confusingly similar to our brands’ names and marks although our policy is to oppose infringements and other unauthorized uses of marks similar or identical to our brands’ marks certain or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks could diminish the value of our concepts’ brands and adversely affect our business and goodwill 

in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or may in the future open or franchise a restaurant and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or the legal protections that may be available will be adequate or that our franchisees will maintain the quality of the goods and services offered under our brands’ trademarks or always act in accordance with guidelines we set for maintaining our brands intellectual property rights and defending or enforcing our trademarks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources or result in significant harm to our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

our brands may also be targets of infringement claims that could interfere with the use of certain names or trademarks andor the proprietary knowhow recipes or trade secrets used in our business defending against such claims is costly and as a result of defending such claims we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages royalties or other fees for using such proprietary information any of which could negatively affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our supply chain and employment 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food equipment and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold or used by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers although certain products and equipment have limited suppliers which increases our reliance on those suppliers we along with our concepts’ franchisees are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products equipment and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items equipment and other supplies to our concepts’ restaurants have happened from time to time and could reduce sales harm our concepts’ reputations and delay the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees we are experiencing and have experienced certain supply chain disruptions resulting from among other things capacity transportation staffing operational and covid19 related challenges which have and may continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations future shortages or disruptions could be caused by the factors noted above as well as factors such as natural disasters health epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic social unrest the impacts of climate change inaccurate forecasting of customer demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports including due to trade disputes or restrictions the inability of vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which the suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards or requirements transitioning to new suppliers or distributors product quality issues or recalls inflation food safety warnings or advisories the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms 

in addition in the us the company and the company’s kfc taco bell and pizza hut franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs” which is a third party responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the habit burger grill entered into a purchasing agreement with rscs in 2020 mclane foodservice inc “mclane” serves as the largest distributor for the company’s kfc taco bell and pizza hut concepts in the us any 

failure or inability of our significant suppliers or distributors including rscs or mclane to meet their respective service requirements could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies 

the loss of key personnel labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth harm our business and reduce our profitability 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business 

in addition our restaurant operations are highly serviceoriented and our success depends in part upon our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees including franchisee management restaurant managers and other crew members the market for qualified employees in the retail food industry is very competitive our and our concepts’ franchisees are experiencing and may continue to experience a shortage of labor for positions in our restaurants including due to the current competitive labor market and concerns around covid19 

inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals may result in reduced operating hours or service levels delay our planned use development or deployment of technology or impact the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees which could have a material adverse impact on the operation of our concepts’ existing restaurants in addition strikes work slowdown or other labor unrest may become more common in the event of a strike work slowdown or other labor unrest the ability to adequately staff our concepts’ restaurants could be impaired which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities 

changes in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees’ results of operations 

an increase in the costs of employee wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees’ operating results in particular labor shortages and the current competitive labor market have increased competition for qualified employees which has compelled and may continue to compel us and our franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain qualified employees including franchisee management restaurant managers and other crew members such increases in costs may result from general economic or competitive conditions or from government imposition of higher minimum wages at the federal state or local level including in connection with the increases in state minimum wages that have recently been enacted by various states and if ultimately enacted the potential increase in the federal minimum wage in the us proposed by the current presidential administration moreover there may be a longterm trend toward higher wages in developing markets any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins 

an increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins 

our and our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins including poultry pork beef and seafood cheese oil flour and vegetables including potatoes and lettuce raw materials purchased for use in our concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather and climate conditions energy costs or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials taxes and tariffs including as a result of trade disputes industry demand inflationary conditions labor shortages transportation issues fuel costs food safety concerns product recalls governmental regulation and other factors all of which are beyond our control and in many instances are unpredictable we have recently experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the price of various raw materials purchased by us as well as increased volatility in such prices which have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations we cannot assure that we or our concepts’ franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices or that the cost of raw materials will remain stable in the future in addition a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors 

because we and our concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases if we and our concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately our and our franchisees’ profit margins and return on invested capital may be adversely impacted which could impact our ability to meet our new unit development targets 

risks related to our concepts’ brands and reputation 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance our corporate reputation and the value and perception of our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food the ingredients we use food safety and our business practices including with respect to the manner in which we source commodities and social and environmental sustainability considerations consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons and some changes can occur rapidly for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that may affect perceptions of our concepts’ brands generally or relative to available alternatives in addition the restaurant industry globally has been subject to scrutiny and claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues such as weight gain and other adverse effects publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our business moreover this scrutiny could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products including legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” which could in turn increase costs of compliance and remediation to us and our franchisees 

in addition business or other incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us our concepts’ restaurants franchisees competitors governments suppliers or distributors can significantly reduce brand value and consumer perception particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or investigations for example the reputation of our concepts’ brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers distributors or franchisees or by claims or perceptions that we founders of our concepts our concepts’ franchisees or other business partners have acted or are acting in an unethical illegal raciallybiased or socially irresponsible manner or are not fostering an inclusive and diverse environment including with respect to the service and treatment of customers at our concepts’ restaurants and our or our franchisees’ treatment of employees regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true our corporate reputation could also suffer from negative publicity or consumer sentiment regarding company action or brand imagery misconduct by any of our or our franchisees employees or a real or perceived failure of corporate governance any such developments could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts’ brands andor our products and reduce consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits 

we cannot guarantee that franchisees or other third parties with licenses to use our intellectual property will not take actions that may harm the value of our intellectual property franchisee use of our concepts’ trademarks are governed through franchise agreements and we monitor use of our trademarks by both franchisees and third parties but franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our concepts’ brands or place our concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation moreover unauthorized third parties including our concepts’ current and former franchisees may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our concepts’ brands resulting in consumer confusion or brand dilution 

our ability to reach consumers and drive results is heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and our ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences including developing and launching new and innovative products and offerings our marketing and advertising programs may not be as successful or may not be as successful as our competitors and thus may adversely affect our business and the strength of our brand 

we may be adversely affected by climate change and other social and environmental sustainability matters including if we are unable to meet goals and commitments that we establish in relation to such matters 

there has been an increased focus including from investors the general public and us and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities on social and environmental sustainability matters including with respect to climate change greenhouse gases packaging and waste human rights sustainable supply chain practices animal health and welfare deforestation and land energy and water use as the result of this heightened focus including from governmental and nongovernmental authorities and our commitment to social and environmental sustainability matters we may provide expanded disclosure establish or expand goals commitments or targets and take actions to meet such goals commitments and targets our ability to meet such goals commitments and targets is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control if we are not effective or are not perceived to be effective in addressing social and environmental sustainability 

matters or meeting such goals commitments and targets consumer trust in our brands may suffer moreover these matters and our efforts to address them could expose us to market operational reputational and execution costs or risks 

we could also be affected by the physical effects of climate change and other environmental issues to the extent such issues adversely affect the general economy adversely impact our supply chain or increase the costs of food and other supplies needed for our operations in addition future us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to combat climate change or other environmental considerations could result in increased regulation and additional taxes and other expenses in a manner that adversely affects our business 

risks related to government regulation and litigation 

we may be subject to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include regulatory claims or disputes by claimants such as franchisees suppliers employees customers governments and others related to operational foreign exchange tax franchise contractual or employment issues these claims or disputes may relate to personal injury franchisees’ employment real estate related environmental tort intellectual property breach of contract data privacy securities derivative and other litigation matters see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties some of which are beyond the company’s control unfavorable rulings or developments may also occur in cases we are not involved in moreover regardless of whether any such lawsuits have merit or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle such litigation may be expensive to defend may divert resources and management attention away from our operations and may negatively impact our results of operations with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our concepts’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

the company and our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws and regulations change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

• the americans with disabilities act in the us and similar laws that provide protection to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas 

• the us fair labor standards act as well as a variety of similar laws which govern matters such as minimum wages and overtime and the us family and medical leave act as well as a variety of similar laws which provide protected leave rights to employees 

• employment laws related to workplace health and safety nondiscrimination nonharassment whistleblower protections and other terms and conditions of employment 

• laws and regulations in governmentmandated health care benefits such as the patient protection and affordable care act in the us 

• laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety product marketing and menu labeling 

• laws relating to state and local licensing 

• laws relating to the relationship between franchisors and franchisees 

• laws and regulations relating to health sanitation food workplace safety child labor including laws regulating the use of certain “hazardous equipment” building and zoning and fire safety and prevention 

• laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities 

• laws relating to information security privacy including the european union’s gdpr and california’s ccpa and cpra cashless payments and consumer protection 

• laws relating to currency conversion or exchange 

• laws relating to international trade and sanctions 

• tax laws and regulations 

• antibribery and anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 

• environmental laws and regulations including with respect to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 

• federal and state immigration laws and regulations in the us 

• regulations health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid19 pandemic 

in addition if any governmental authority were to adopt and implement a broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under laws such as the national labor relations act in a manner that is applied generally to franchise relationships which broader standards in the past have been adopted by us governmental agencies such as the national labor relations board this could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and could subject our concepts to other liabilities andor require our concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our concepts’ franchisees further a california law enacted in 2019 adopted an employment classification test to be used when determining employee or independent contractor status which establishes a high threshold to obtain independent contractor status moreover other labor related laws enacted at the federal state or local level could increase our and our franchisees’ labor costs and decrease profitability or could cause employees of our franchisees to be deemed employees of our concepts 

any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or related standards or guidelines could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial results or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses internal investigations governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues in addition the compliance costs associated with complying with new or existing legal requirements could be substantial 

tax matters including changes in tax rates or laws disagreements with taxing authorities imposition of new taxes and our restructurings could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience interpretations of applicable law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities but such accruals require significant judgment which may be incorrect and may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued if the internal revenue service “irs” or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties which could be material in addition public perception that we are not paying a sufficient amount of taxes could damage our concepts’ reputations which could harm our profitability for example as disclosed in note 20 as a result of an audit by the irs for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 on october 13 2021 we received a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs for the 2014 fiscal year relating to a series of reorganizations we undertook during that year in connection with the business realignment of our corporate and management reporting structure along brand lines while we disagree with the position of the irs and intend to contest it vigorously an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

in addition changes in laws regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation including potential changes in us tax laws supported by the current us presidential administration could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example in january 2022 the us treasury published new regulations impacting foreign tax credit utilization beginning in the company’s 2022 tax year these regulations make foreign taxes paid to certain countries no longer creditable in the us while our determination of which foreign taxes that will no longer be creditable is not yet complete we anticipate that these regulations are likely to result in additional tax due in the us in future years see note 21 for further discussion moreover if significant jurisdictions in which we or our concepts operate enact tax legislation modify tax treaties andor increase audit scrutiny based on the action on base erosion and profit shifting guidance of the organisation for economic cooperation and development it could increase our taxes and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition we have in the past and may in the future adapt our entity and operating structure in response to and in compliance with changes in tax laws regulations or interpretation of existing laws and regulations such restructurings could result in material incremental tax costs associated with restructuring transactions or operations of the structure 

risks related to the yum china spinoff 

the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

we received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions qualified as generally taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code the opinions relied on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings including with respect to future conduct made by yum china and us if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the irs because the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge 

if notwithstanding receipt of any opinion the irs were to conclude that the yum china spinoff was taxable in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the yum china common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition each us holder of our common stock who received shares of yum china common stock in connection with the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of yum china common stock received that distribution would be taxable to each such us stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such us stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

the yum china spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

in february 2015 the chinese state tax administration “sta” issued the bulletin on several issues of enterprise income tax on income arising from indirect transfers of property by nonresident enterprises “bulletin 7” pursuant to bulletin 7 an “indirect transfer” of chinese taxable assets including equity interests in a china resident enterprise “chinese interests” by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of chinese taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of chinese enterprise income tax using general antitax avoidance provisions the sta may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of chinese interests if the transfer has avoided chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to chinese enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of up to 10 of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a china resident enterprise 

we evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 in connection with the separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and continue to believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply and that the restructuring had reasonable commercial purpose 

however there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10 assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of yum china as our tax basis in yum china was minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

risks related to consumer discretionary spending and macroeconomic conditions 

our business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and economic conditions in the us and international markets 

as a restaurant company dependent upon consumer discretionary spending we and our franchisees are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty regarding macroeconomic conditions in the us and in other regions of the world where our concepts and concepts’ franchisees operate some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment and underemployment rates fluctuations in the level of disposable income the price of gasoline other inflationary pressures stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our or our franchisees’ sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results in this regard we and our franchisees have been adversely impacted by and may continue to be adversely impacted by ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the us and other regions of the world where our concepts and concepts’ 

franchisees operate arising in connection with the covid19 pandemic including recent labor commodity and other inflationary pressures supply chain disruptions and impacts arising from governmental restrictions implemented in certain regions to mitigate against the pandemic in addition negative macroeconomic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our businesses may result in future asset impairment charges such as the goodwill impairment charge we incurred with respect to the habit burger grill reporting unit in the first quarter of 2020 

risks related to competition 

the retail food industry is highly competitive 

our concepts’ restaurants compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants and the retail food industry in which our concepts operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives including the frequent use by our competitors of price discounting such as through value meal menu options coupons and other methods customer service reputation restaurant location attractiveness and maintenance of properties management and hourly personnel and qualified franchisees moreover if we are unable to successfully respond to changing consumer or dietary preferences if our marketing efforts andor launch of new products are unsuccessful or if our concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our and our franchisees’ businesses could be adversely affected in addition the covid19 pandemic has also resulted in a disruption of consumer routines the implementation of employer “workfromhome” policies reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and it is difficult to fully assess the impacts of such developments on us or our concepts or the extent to which any such consumer patterns may continue after the covid19 pandemic has ended we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas and this trend which has accelerated following the onset of the covid19 pandemic is expected to continue to increase finally not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors increased competition could have an adverse effect on our business or development plans 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain 

as of december 31 2021 our total outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt was approximately 113 billion subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt from time to time which would increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness 

specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 

• increasing our vulnerability to and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment including developments arising from the covid19 pandemic 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividends share repurchases or other corporate purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating which could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates 

• increasing our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as current and future borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest 

• increasing our exposure to the risk of discontinuance replacement or modification of certain reference rates including as the result of the upcoming discontinuance of libor which are used to calculate applicable interest rates of our indebtedness and certain derivative instruments that hedge interest rate risk 

• making it more difficult for us to repay refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increasing the cost of any such borrowing 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations as the result of the terms of our indebtedness which if not complied with could result in an event of default which in turn if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies and 

• increasing our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is primarily denominated in us dollars 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future debt or equity financings are not available to us on acceptable terms in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend

introduction and overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements “financial statements” in item 8 and the forwardlooking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements tabular amounts are displayed in millions of us dollars except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified percentages may not recompute due to rounding 

yum brands inc and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as the “company” “yum” “we” “us” or “our” franchise or operate a system of over 53000 restaurants in 157 countries and territories primarily under the concepts of kfc taco bell pizza hut and the habit burger grill collectively the “concepts” the companys kfc taco bell and pizza hut brands are global leaders of the chicken mexicanstyle and pizza food categories respectively the habit burger grill a concept we acquired in march 2020 is a fastcasual restaurant concept specializing in madetoorder chargrilled burgers sandwiches and more of the over 53000 restaurants 98 are operated by franchisees 

as of december 31 2021 yum consists of four operating segments 

• the kfc division which includes our worldwide operations of the kfc concept 

• the taco bell division which includes our worldwide operations of the taco bell concept 

• the pizza hut division which includes our worldwide operations of the pizza hut concept 

• the habit burger grill division which includes our worldwide operations of the habit burger grill concept 

through our recipe for growth and good we intend to unlock the growth potential of our concepts and yum drive increased collaboration across our concepts and geographies and consistently deliver better customer experiences improved unit economics and higher rates of growth key enablers include accelerated use of technology and better leverage of our systemwide scale 

our recipe for growth is based on four key drivers 

• unrivaled culture and talent leverage our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success 

• unmatched operating capability recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences 

• relevant easy and distinctive brands innovate and elevate iconic restaurant brands people trust and champion 

• bold restaurant development drive market and franchise expansion with strong economics and value 

our global citizenship and sustainability strategy called the recipe for good reflects our priorities for socially responsible growth risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people food and planet 

we intend to drive longterm growth and shareholder returns primarily through consistent samestore sales growth and new unit development across all of our concepts we intend to support this growth and development through a capital and operating structure that 

• targets a capital structure of 50x earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” consolidated net leverage 

• invests capital in a manner consistent with an asset light franchisor model 

• allocates ga in an efficient manner that provides leverage to operating profit growth while at the same time opportunistically investing in strategic growth initiatives and 

• pays a competitive dividend and returns excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases 

we intend for this mda to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations including performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following performance metrics 

• samestore sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system for one year or more except as noted below including those temporarily closed from timetotime restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement rebuilding natural disasters health epidemic or pandemic landlord disputes or other issues throughout 2020 and 2021 we have had a significant number of restaurants that were temporarily closed including restaurants closed due to government and landlord restrictions as a result of covid19 the system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining samestore sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count see below we believe samestore sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our concepts existing store base additionally samestore sales growth is reflective of the strength of our brands the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends in 2021 and 2020 when calculating respective samestore sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of our acquisition of the habit restaurants inc on march 18 2020 and that were open for one year or more in 2019 when calculating samestore sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of the food delivery brands group sa previously named telepizza group sa “telepizza” strategic alliance in december 2018 and that were open for one year or more see additional discussion of the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc and telepizza strategic alliance within this mda 

• gross unit openings reflects new openings by us and our franchisees net new unit growth reflects gross unit openings offset by permanent store closures by us and our franchisees to determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider factors such as whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another yum unit serves the primary product of one of our concepts operates under a separate franchise agreement if operated by a franchisee and has substantial and sustainable sales we believe gross unit openings and net new unit growth are useful to investors because we depend on new units for a significant portion of our growth additionally gross unit openings and net new unit growth are generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our concept restaurants 

• system sales system sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation “fx” and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53 rd week in 2019 for our us subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly period calendar system sales reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including companyowned and franchise restaurants sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company at a rate of 3 to 6 of sales increasingly customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts products we also include in system sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts products are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income however any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the companys revenues we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers company and franchise samestore sales as well as net unit growth 

in addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” the company provides the following nongaap measurements 

• diluted earnings per share excluding special items as defined below 

• effective tax rate excluding special items 

• core operating profit and core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2019 core operating profit excludes special items and fx and we use core operating profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally 

• company restaurant profit and company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales as defined below 

these nongaap measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of these nongaap measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

special items are not included in any of our division segment results as the company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of special items when assessing segment performance 

company restaurant profit is defined as company sales less company restaurant expenses both of which appear on the face of our consolidated statements of income company restaurant expenses include those expenses incurred directly by our companyowned restaurants in generating company sales including cost of food and paper cost of restaurantlevel labor rent depreciation and amortization of restaurantlevel assets and advertising expenses incurred by and on behalf of that company restaurant company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales company restaurant margin  is defined as company restaurant profit divided by company sales we use company restaurant profit for the purposes of internally evaluating the performance of our companyowned restaurants and we believe company restaurant profit provides useful information to investors as to the profitability of our companyowned restaurants in calculating company restaurant profit the company excludes revenues and expenses directly associated with our franchise operations as well as nonrestaurantlevel costs included in general and administrative expenses some of which may support companyowned restaurant operations the company also excludes restaurantlevel asset impairment and closures expenses which have historically not been significant from the determination of company restaurant profit as such expenses are not believed to be indicative of ongoing operations company restaurant profit and company restaurant margin  as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry 

certain performance metrics and nongaap measurements are presented excluding the impact of fx these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates we believe the elimination of the fx impact provides better yeartoyear comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 

for 2019 we provided core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019

a due to their size and volatility we have reflected as special items those refranchising gains and losses that were recorded in connection with our previously announced plans to have at least 98 franchise restaurant ownership by the end of 2018 as such refranchising gains and losses recorded during 2021 2020 and 2019 as special items are directly associated with restaurants that were refranchised prior to the end of 2018

additionally during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded net refranchising gains of 32 million 26 million and 25 million respectively that have not been reflected as special items these gains relate to 

refranchising of restaurants in 2021 2020 and 2019 that were not part of our aforementioned plans to achieve 98 franchise ownership and that we believe are now more indicative of our expected ongoing refranchising activity 

b in may 2017 we reached an agreement with our pizza hut us franchisees that improved brand marketing alignment accelerated enhancements in operations and technology and that included a permanent commitment to incremental advertising as well as digital and technology contributions by franchisees in connection with this agreement we recognized charges of 5 million and 13 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively related to operating investments required as part of this agreement the majority of these costs were recorded within franchise and property expenses based on their nature and the significance in related spending in 2017 these charges have been reflected as special items 

c during the second quarter of 2019 we recorded charges of 8 million and 2 million to other income expense and interest expense net respectively related to cash payments in excess of our recorded liability to settle contingent consideration associated with our 2013 acquisition of the kfc turkey and pizza hut turkey businesses consistent with prior adjustments to the recorded contingent consideration we have reflected this as a special item

we reflected the call premiums and charges associated with the redemptions as special items due to their collective size and the fact that the amounts are not indicative of our ongoing interest expense 

e tax expense benefit on special items was determined based upon the impact of the nature as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within special items 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded as a special item an 8 million tax benefit related to prior refranchisings for which the associated pretax gain or loss was recorded as special further in the fourth quarter of 2019 we increased our income tax provision by 34 million to record a reserve against the tax recorded on a prior year divestiture the effects of which were previously recorded as a special item

items impacting reported results andor reasonably likely to impact future results 

the following items impacted reported results in 2021 andor 2020 andor are reasonably likely to impact future results see also the detail of special items section of this mda for other items similarly impacting results 

covid19 

in late 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was first detected and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic throughout 2020 and 2021 covid19 spread throughout the us and the rest of the world and governmental authorities have implemented measures to reduce the spread of covid19 these measures include restrictions on travel outside the home and other limitations on business and other activities as well as encouraging social distancing as a result of covid19 we and our franchisees have experienced significant store closures and instances of reduced storelevel operations including reduced operating hours and diningroom closures the impact on our sales in each of our markets has been dependent on the timing severity and duration of the outbreak measures implemented by government authorities to reduce the spread of covid19 as well as our reliance on dinein sales in the market 

our results were significantly impacted by the impacts of covid19 in the year ended december 31 2020 as evidenced by our worldwide samestore sales decline of 6 overall our sales declines were primarily driven by temporary store closures which peaked in early april 2020 at about 11000 restaurants and ended 2020 at about 830 restaurants in addition to the loss of sales due to restaurants being temporarily closed we also lost sales due to dining room closures or other limitations on access 

beginning in 2020 and continuing throughout 2021 we were able to mitigate the loss of sales due to temporary unit closures dining room closures or other limitations on access through the strength of our offpremise channels aided by increasing consumer access to our brands via digital channels as a result each of our concepts recorded positive samestore sales growth for the year contributing to our worldwide samestore sales increase of 10 in 2021 which was driven by strong performance in developed markets such as north america and the united kingdom as we ended the year covid19 outbreaks and resulting government restrictions limiting mobility continued to impact sales in a few key markets primarily in asia we also saw strong gross unit openings of 4180 units for the year ended december 31 2021 which we believe is primarily a result of improving unitlevel economics our franchisees’ financial strength and commitment to our concepts the inherent competitive advantages of the quick service restaurant sector throughout the covid19 pandemic our concepts’ offpremise and digital capabilities as well as selective use of development incentives with certain franchisees 

the covid19 situation is ongoing and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to forecast any impacts on the companys 2022 results the ultimate pace of our recovery will largely depend on the continuation of current sales trends although we expect continuing adverse impacts from covid19 in certain parts of the world in addition for our restaurants that prominently 

feature drivethru carryout and delivery options covid19 has in many cases contributed to an increase in sales during 2021 and 2020 if the impact of covid19 recedes inperson dining restrictions are lifted or lessened and the restaurant industry in general returns to more normal operations the benefits to sales experienced by certain of our restaurants including our pizza hut delivery restaurants could wane and our results could be negatively impacted 

franchise bad debt expense 

we experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in franchise bad debt expense in 2021 and 2020 due in large part to the uncertainties associated with covid19 during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized net bad debt recoveries of 8 million related to shortterm accounts receivable due from our franchisees for royalties rent and other services we provide which were primarily reflected within franchise and property expenses these net bad debt recoveries of 8 million compared to 13 million of net bad debt expense recognized in the year ended december 31 2020 and thus positively impacted operating profit growth by 21 million yearoveryear 

investment in devyani 

in 2020 we received an approximate 5 minority interest in devyani international limited “devyani” an entity that operates kfc and pizza hut franchised units in india the minority interest was received in lieu of cash proceeds upon the refranchising of approximately 60 kfc restaurants in india at the time of the refranchisings the fair value of this minority interest was estimated to be approximately 31 million on august 16 2021 devyani executed an initial public offering and subsequently the fair value of this investment became readily determinable as a result concurrent with the initial public offering we began recording changes in fair value in investment income expense net in our consolidated statements of income and recognized pretax investment income of 87 million in the year ended december 31 2021 

investment in grubhub inc grubhub 

in april of 2018 we purchased 28 million shares of grubhub common stock for 200 million in the quarter ended september 30 2020 we sold our entire investment in grubhub and received proceeds of 206 million while we held our investment in grubhub common stock we recognized changes in the fair value in our investment in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recognized pretax investment income of 69 million and pretax investment expense of 77 million respectively related to changes in fair value of our investment in grubhub common stock 

extra week in 2019 

fiscal 2019 included a 53rd week for all of our us and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a period calendar see note 2 for additional details related to our fiscal calendar the following table summarizes the estimated impact of the 53rd week on revenues and operating profit for the year ended december 31 2019 the 53rd week in 2019 favorably impacted diluted eps by 005 per share

in 2021 the increase in ga excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation was driven by higher expenses related to our annual incentive compensation programs higher professional fees and higher charitable contributions partially offset by lower headcount and lower sharebased compensation 

operating profit 

in 2021 the increase in operating profit was driven by samestore sales growth and unit growth partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and higher ga costs

habit burger grill division 

the habit burger grill division has 318 units the vast majority of which are in the us the company owned 90 of the habit burger grill units in the us as of december 31 2021 





corporate  unallocated 



corporate and unallocated ga 

in 2021 the decrease in corporate and unallocated ga expenses was driven by lapping higher prior year cost for charitable contributions including 50 million related to our “unlocking opportunity initiative” and 25 million related to covid19 relief see note 5 the decrease was also driven by lapping prior year costs associated with a voluntary early retirement programs offered to our us based employees and a worldwide severance program see note 5 offset by higher current year expenses related to our annual incentive compensation programs and increased headcount supporting our technology initiatives 

unallocated other income expense 

unallocated other income expense for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a charge of 144 million related to the impairment of habit burger grill goodwill see note 3 

interest expense net 

the increase in interest expense net for 2021 was primarily driven by increased outstanding borrowings offset by a lower weighted averageinterest rate 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1706 million in 2021 versus 1305 million in 2020 the increase was largely driven by an increase in operating profit before special items the lapping of charitable contributions reflected as special items and an increase in upfront fees received partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable collections and higher advertising spending 

net cash used in investing activities was 173 million in 2021 versus 335 million in 2020 the change was primarily driven by the lapping of our prior year acquisition of the habit restaurants inc higher refranchising proceeds in the current year and the current year sale of certain mutual fund investments partially offset by the lapping of prior year proceeds from the sale of our investment in grubhub inc common stock the current year acquisition of dragontail systems limited and higher current year capital spending 

net cash used in financing activities was 1767 million in 2021 versus 738 million in 2020 the change was primarily driven by higher share repurchases partially offset by higher net borrowings 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash flows from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment and from the operations of our companyowned stores our annual operating cash flows have been in excess of 13 billion in each of the past three years and we expect that to continue to be the case in 2022 it is our intent to use these operating cash flows to continue to invest in growing our business and pay a competitive dividend with any remaining excess then returned to shareholders through share repurchases to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash do not cover our anticipated cash needs we maintain a 125 billion revolving facility under our credit agreement see note 11 that was undrawn as of december 31 2021 we believe that our ongoing cash from operations cash on hand which was approximately 500 million at december 31 2021 and availability under our revolving facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements over the next twelve months 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

debt obligations and interest payments 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 93 including the impact of interest rate swaps of our 113 billion of total debt outstanding excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 42 we currently target a capital structure which reflects consolidated leverage net of available cash of 50x ebitda and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years we have credit ratings of bb standard  poorsba2 moodys with a balance sheet consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies 

the following table summarizes the future maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts as of december 31 2021 



interest payments on the outstanding longterm debt in the table above total 3384 million with 464 million due within the next twelve months on the outstanding amounts on a nominal basis the estimated interest payments related to the variable rate portion of our debt are based on current libor interest rates 

see note 11 for details on the securitization notes the credit agreement subsidiary senior unsecured notes and yum senior unsecured notes 

operating and finance leases 

payments required under our operating and finance leases total 1252 million of which 141 million is payable within the next 12 months these amounts are on a nominal basis and include payments related to lease renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise these leases relate primarily to approximately 700 companyowned restaurants and approximately 300 leased restaurants for which we sublease land building or both to our franchisees see note 12 

capital expenditures 

we remain committed to maintaining our asset light franchisor model that includes at least a 98 franchise mix our allocation strategy for capital expenditures includes 

• runrate capital expenditures consisting of company restaurant repairs maintenance and remodels support of our digital and technology initiatives and projectspecific capital expenditures 

• targeted new company unit development to spur additional growth that is largely funded through refranchising a comparable number of existing company units and 

• strategic investments that create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees 

in 2022 we expect that new store investments will exceed refranchising proceeds by 50 to 100 million primarily driven by our strategy to accelerate growth of the habit burger grill equity estate this will result in net capital expenditures of approximately 250 million reflecting up to 350 million of gross capital expenditures and 100 million of refranchising proceeds 

purchase obligations 

our purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction we have excluded agreements that are cancellable without penalty our purchase obligations relate primarily to marketing information technology and supply agreements we have purchase obligations of approximately 420 million at december 31 2021 with approximately 240 million due within the next 12 months 

in addition to our contractual and other obligations we seek to pay a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases as discussed in note 20 we are also subject to claims and contingencies related to certain tax and legal matters that may require future cash outlays 

dividends and share repurchases 

in february 2022 our board of directors declared a dividend of 057 per share of common stock a 14 increase from the quarterly dividend of 50 per share of common stock paid in 2021 this quarterly dividend will be distributed march 11 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 18 2022 and will total approximately 165 million 

in may 2021 our board of directors authorized share repurchases from july 1 2021 through december 31 2022 of up to 2 billion excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2021 we have remaining capacity to repurchase up to 950 million of common stock under this authorization this authorization does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 20 as a result of an audit by the internal revenue service “irs” for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 on october 13 2021 we received a notice of proposed adjustment “npa” from the irs for the 2014 fiscal year relating to a series of reorganizations we undertook during that year in connection with the business realignment of our corporate and management reporting structure along brand lines the irs asserts that these reorganizations involved taxable distributions of approximately 60 billion we expect to receive the final revenue agent’s report “rar” including the irs’s calculation of the tax assessment in early 2022 the amount of additional tax that may be asserted by the irs in the rar cannot be quantified at this time however based on the npa the amount of additional tax to be proposed is expected to be material we disagree with the irs’s position as asserted in the npa and intend to contest it vigorously by filing a protest disputing on multiple grounds any proposed taxes and proceeding to the irs office of appeals 

also as discussed in note 20 on january 29 2020 we received an order from the special director of the directorate of enforcement in india imposing a penalty on yum restaurants india private limited of approximately indian rupee 11 billion or approximately 150 million primarily relating to alleged violations of operating conditions imposed in 1993 and 1994 we have been advised by external counsel that the order is flawed and have filed a writ petition with the delhi high court which granted an interim stay of the penalty order on march 5 2020 the stay order remains in effect and the next hearing is scheduled for march 4 2022 we deny liability and intend to continue vigorously defending this matter we do not consider the risk of any significant loss arising from this order to be probable 

see the lease guarantees section of note 20 for discussion of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in march 2020 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance related to reference rate reform the pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from libor and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates the guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through december 31 2022 we are currently evaluating the impact of the transition from libor to alternative reference rates including the impact on our interest rate swaps as of december 30 2021 our interest rate swaps which expire in march 2025 had notional amounts of 15 billion these interest rate swaps are designated cash flow hedges we do not anticipate the impact of adopting this standard will be material to our financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants we intend to continue operating as company restaurants primarily ppe rightofuse operating lease assets and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we writedown the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

in each of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2019 our primary indicator of potential impairment for our restaurant assets was two consecutive years of operating losses for the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic this indicator was expanded to include restaurants that were open less than two years with cumulative operating losses for the last year or cumulative operating losses since the store open date if open less than one year 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level when it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future aftertax cash flows associated with the intangible asset our most significant indefinitelived intangible asset is our habit burger grill brand asset with a book value of 96 million at december 31 2021 as of our fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment testing date the habit burger grill’s forecasted results have improved from those used in determining the brand asset fair value as part of the prior year impairment test as such the fair values of all of our indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2021 were in excess of their respective carrying values and no impairment was recorded 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc taco bell pizza hut and habit burger grill divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from franchise royalties and companyowned restaurant operations if any future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 

future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth from net new units or samestore sales growth and margin improvement for those reporting units which include companyowned restaurant operations assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were in excess of their respective carrying values as of our fourth quarter 2021 goodwill testing date with all but the habit burger grill reporting unit having fair values that were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2021 goodwill testing date as it relates to our habit burger grill reporting unit assumptions for unit growth and samestore sales growth utilized in the fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment test improved as compared to the prior year impairment test due in large part to the continued recovery from the impacts of covid19 as such the fair value of the reporting unit increased versus prior year 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2021 refranchising activity completed by the company was limited and the writeoff of goodwill associated with these transactions was approximately 3 million 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1069 million and a fair value of plan assets of 1010 million at december 31 2021 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 300 at december 31 2021 the primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or standard  poors sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 65 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 72 million at our measurement date 

the net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2022 is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect net periodic benefit cost for our us plans to decrease approximately 8 million in 2022 a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our 2021 measurement date would impact our 2022 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 6 million the impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are reflected primarily in other pension income expense 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical and expected future returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2022 pension expense at december 31 2021 was 540 net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2022 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 9 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 540 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 9 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 33 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income for these us plans at december 31 2021 we will recognize approximately 11 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2022 versus 14 million recognized in 2021 

income taxes 

at december 31 2021 we had valuation allowances of 462 million to reduce our 1541 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions carryforward periods restrictions on usage and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2021 we had 116 

million of unrecognized tax benefits 75 million of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

repatriation of earnings generated after december 31 2017 will generally be eligible for the 100 dividends received deduction or considered a distribution of previously taxed income and therefore exempt from us federal tax undistributed foreign earnings may still be subject to certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes upon repatriation subject to limited exceptions we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted earnings outside the us thus we have provided taxes including any us federal and state income foreign income or foreign withholding taxes on the majority of our unremitted earnings in jurisdictions where we do intend to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted earnings we would be required to accrue and pay applicable income taxes if any and foreign withholding taxes if the funds were repatriated in taxable transactions we believe any such taxes would be immaterial

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us our outstanding total debt excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts of 113 billion includes 80 fixedrate debt and 20 variablerate debt we have attempted to minimize the interest rate risk from variablerate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that as of december 31 2021 result in a fixed interest rate on 15 billion of our variablerate debt as a result approximately 93 of our 113 billion of outstanding debt at december 31 2021 is effectively fixedrate debt see note 11 for details on our outstanding debt and note 13 for details related to interest rate swaps 

at december 31 2021 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swaps in an increase of approximately 7 million in interest expense net within our consolidated statement of income these estimated amounts are based upon the current level of variablerate debt that has not been swapped to fixed and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and exclude any impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 

the fair value of our cumulative fixedrate debt of 95 billion as of december 31 2021 would decrease approximately 565 million as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase at december 31 2021 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would decrease the liability associated with the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately 46 million fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the durations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 11 billion as of december 31 2021 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 operating profit would have decreased approximately 145 million if 

all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs at our companyoperated restaurants as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors 

equity investment risk 

yum holds approximately 53 million shares of devyani international limited “devyani” common stock see note 5 as of december 31 2021 the national stock exchange of india limited composite closing sales price of devyani was indian rupee 16505 a hypothetical 10 decline in the price of these shares would result in a 12 million decrease in the fair value of these investments which would be reflected as a charge in investment income expense net within our consolidated statements of income the effects of changes in market prices for equity securities are unpredictable which could cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results

franchise agreements 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises the company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment capability and capitalization to grow our concepts franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies the company has franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business such as our relationship with yum china our strategic alliance with telepizza group sa who is the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america excluding brazil and portions of europe and our relationship with certain large franchisees such as flynn restaurant group an existing yum franchisee which recently announced its intention to acquire approximately 950 pizza hut us restaurants which would make it the largest operator of pizza hut restaurants in the us 

the company has successfully increased franchise restaurant ownership in recent years and utilizes both storelevel franchise and master franchise programs to grow our businesses of our over 49000 franchised units at december 31 2020 approximately 30 operate under our master franchise programs including over 9500 units in mainland china the remainder of our franchise units operate under storelevel franchise agreements under both types of franchise programs franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business in certain historical refranchising transactions the company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee storelevel franchise agreements typically require payment to the company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee 

franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants’ sales typically between 4 to 6 and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand under master franchise arrangements the company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as subfranchise restaurants within certain geographic territories master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of subfranchisees in exchange master franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the subfranchisees under their franchise agreements and typically pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate our largest master franchisee yum china pays the company a continuing fee of 3 on system sales of our concepts in mainland china the use by yum china of certain of our material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between yum restaurants consulting shanghai company limited “yccl” a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of yum china and yum through yri china franchising llc a subsidiary of yum effective from january 1 2020 and previously through yum restaurants asia pte ltd another subsidiary of yum from october 31 2016 to december 31 2019 

the company seeks to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards 

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants “qsr” traditional units can feature dinein carryout drivethru and delivery services nontraditional units include express units and kiosks that have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in carryout food andor have the concepts food delivered either through storelevel or thirdparty delivery services in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut and habit burger grill offer a drivethru option on a much more limited basis 

our restaurant operations and results were significantly impacted by a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 in the year ended december 31 2020 this included having a significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures and other limitations on access in response we accelerated our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience and our offpremise capabilities this included increasing our focus on driving digital sales where customers utilize ordering interaction that is primarily facilitated by automated technology in 2020 our system restaurants generated digital sales of 17 billion which represented an approximate 45 increase over 2019 additionally the number of restaurants that now offer delivery increased to over 35000 restaurants which represents over 70 of our global system 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches where sufficient scale allows area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants 

supply and distribution 

the company and franchisees of the concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done in practice the company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these supplies are generally available 

in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs a third party which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment additionally the habit burger grill entered into a purchasing agreement with rscs effective july 31 2020 the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with our franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane foodservice inc is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee restaurants outside the us we and our concepts’ franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors our international franchisees generally select and manage their own thirdparty suppliers and distributors subject to our internal standards all suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products andor services that comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations in the state andor country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards 

advertising and promotional programs 

companyowned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants’ sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the concepts advertising may be conducted nationally regionally and locally when multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and companyowned restaurants if any contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants’ sales the contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising market research commercial production talent payments and other support functions for the respective concepts we have the right to control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives typically in markets where we have companyowned restaurants through our majority voting rights 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including our kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® taco bell® and the habit® marks have significant value and material importance to our business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks 

the use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in our marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not currently considered material to our business

dishes the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power within the retail food industry each of our concepts competes with international national and regional chains as well as locallyowned establishments not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on our operations due to possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2020 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated

 item 1a risk factors tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements expectations and historical trends any of the following risk factors either by itself or together with other risk factors could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

risks related to covid19 health epidemics and food safety 

the novel coronavirus covid19 global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in late 2019 covid19 was first detected and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic during 2020 covid19 spread throughout the us and the rest of the world and governmental authorities implemented measures to reduce the spread of covid19 these measures include restrictions on travel outside the home or other limitations on business and other activities as well as encouraging social distancing moreover covid19 cases increased in late 2020 and early 2021 in the us and various other regions of the world in which we have operations which resulted in some governmental authorities reimposing restrictions on business and other activities that were previously lifted or reduced 

developments related to covid19 have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impacts of covid19 have included the ongoing loss of revenues due to reduced and limited storelevel operations continued or increased full or partial dining room closures other restrictions on our business and operations continued delays in reopening and an increase in the number of permanent restaurant closures during the year ended december 31 2020 the impact on our sales in each of our markets has been dependent on among other factors the timing severity and duration of the outbreak measures implemented by government authorities to reduce the spread of covid19 and our reliance on dinein sales in the market additionally we and our franchisees have made operational changes intended to safeguard employees and customers in response to covid19 including increased cleaning and sanitization installation of counter 

screens and purchasing personal protective equipment which have increased and may continue to increase restaurant operating costs and impact restaurantlevel margins and return on invested capital our and our franchisees restaurants may experience interruptions of food and other supplies as well as labor shortages as a result of covid19 thereby disrupting our and our franchisees operations and impacting samestore sales negatively 

our success is heavily reliant on our concepts’ franchisees and the covid19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause financial distress for certain franchisees particularly those located in areas most significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of this distress our franchisees may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us as they come due including the payment of royalties rent or other amounts due to the company this has led to and may continue to lead to writeoffs of amounts we have currently due from our franchisees beyond amounts we have reserved as well as decreased future collections from franchisees in certain instances we offered grace periods to our franchisees who were in good standing with the company and needed greater access to capital for certain nearterm payments due to us offering grace periods negatively impacts the company’s cash flows in the shortterm and if grace periods are necessitated in the future there is no guarantee that our franchisees will ultimately pay amounts due additionally our franchisees may not be able to make payments to landlords distributors and key suppliers as well as payments to service any debt they may have outstanding franchisee financial distress has also led to and may continue to lead to permanent store closures and delayed or reduced new franchisee development which may further harm our results and liquidity further in some cases we are contingently liable for franchisee lease obligations and a failure by a franchisee to perform its obligations under such lease could result in direct payment obligations for yum 

we are unable to fully predict the impact that covid19 will have on our and our franchisees’ operations going forward due to various uncertainties including the severity and duration of the outbreak the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines the timing and effectiveness of the ongoing rollout of vaccines the extent to which covid19 may cause customers to continue to be reluctant to return to inrestaurant dining or otherwise change their consumption patterns including after the covid19 pandemic has ended additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and the length and severity of ongoing negative economic conditions in the us and globally arising from the covid19 pandemic moreover if conditions related to the covid19 pandemic result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets or negatively impact our credit ratings our cost of borrowing our ability to access capital on favorable terms and our overall liquidity and capital structure could be adversely impacted finally the negative economic conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic have resulted in the impairment of the value of certain of our restaurant assets as well as the goodwill impairment charge we incurred with respect to our habit burger grill reporting unit in the first quarter of 2020 if such conditions persist and continue to adversely affect our business this could give rise to impairment in the value of other tangible or intangible assets conversely for our restaurants that prominently feature drivethru carryout and delivery options covid19 has in many cases contributed to an increase in sales during 2020 if the impact of covid19 recedes inperson dining restrictions are lifted or lessened and the restaurant industry in general returns to more normal operations the benefits to sales experienced by certain of our restaurants including our pizza hut delivery restaurants could wane and our results could be negatively impacted 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli listeria salmonella and trichinosis occur or may occur within our system from time to time in addition food safety issues such as food tampering contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time furthermore due to the covid19 pandemic there are now stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts’ restaurants including restaurants operated by us or our concepts’ franchisees or linking our competitors or the retail food industry generally to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation governmental investigations or actions and damages if a customer of one of our concepts’ restaurants becomes ill from food borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or our suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect either our or our concepts’ franchisees’ revenues and profits the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

health concerns arising from the outbreak of a health epidemic or pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic in addition to the current covid19 pandemic as discussed above including arising from various strains of avian flu or swine flu such as h1n1 particularly if located in regions from which we derive a significant amount of revenue or profit the occurrence of such an outbreak or other adverse public health developments could materially disrupt our business and operations such events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary closure of restaurants which could severely disrupt our or our franchisees’ operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu or other illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world and such outbreaks have resulted in confirmed human cases it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products because poultry is a menu offering for our concepts this would likely result in lower revenues and profits for us and our concepts’ franchisees avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact profit margins and revenues for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

furthermore other viruses may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures impose restrictions on operations of restaurants or restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and operating results 

risks related to our business strategy and reliance upon franchisees 

our operating results and growth strategies are closely and increasingly tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

the vast majority 98 of our restaurants are operated by our concepts’ franchisees and our percentage of franchiseowned restaurants has increased in recent years our refranchising efforts have increased our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our concepts’ franchisees in addition our longterm growth depends on maintaining the pace of our net system unit growth rate nearly all of this unit growth is expected to result from new unit openings by our concepts’ franchisees we also rely on master franchisees who have rights to license to subfranchisees the right to develop and operate restaurants to achieve our expectations for new unit development if our concepts’ franchisees and master franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development we may not achieve our desired growth 

we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased fees paid to us for royalties advertising funds contributions and other discrete services we may provide to our concept’s franchisees eg management of ecommerce platforms if our concepts’ franchisees fail to adequately capitalize their businesses or incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in their financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy or the inability to meet development targets or obligations if a significant franchisee of one of our concepts becomes or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees in the aggregate become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed fee payments that cause us to record bad debt expense reduced advertising fund contributions and reduced new unit development for example npc international inc “npc” which had been our largest pizza hut us franchisee filed voluntary petitions in july 2020 to restructure under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in connection with this bankruptcy filing we consented to the closure of up to 300 mutually selected underperforming units primarily dinein locations furthermore the covid19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause financial distress for some portion of our concepts’ franchisees in addition we are secondarily liable on certain of our concepts’ franchisees’ restaurant lease agreements including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with the refranchising of certain companyowned restaurants our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties to the extent our concepts’ franchisees default on such lease agreements in addition the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to attract and retain quality personnel or adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and the development of new restaurants which in turn could hurt our business 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our concepts’ franchisees to implement marketing programs and major initiatives such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades which may require financial investment our concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the company 

additionally the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to focus on key elements of restaurant operations such as quality service and cleanliness even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents may be attributed by guests to our concepts’ entire brand and could have a negative impact on our business 

our reliance on master franchise arrangements can decrease our level of control over our concepts’ restaurants and increase certain risks arising from franchise operations for example we rely on our master franchisees to monitor and enforce subfranchisee compliance with our operating standards and a failure to comply with such standards could adversely affect our business 

the financial performance of certain of our concepts’ franchisees has an outsized impact on our operating results 

we have franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business such as our relationship with yum china in connection with the spinoff of our china business in 2016 into an independent publiclytraded company the “separation” or “yum china spinoff” we entered into a master license agreement pursuant to which yum china is the exclusive licensee of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in mainland china following the separation yum china became and continues to be our largest franchisee our financial results are significantly affected by yum china’s results as we are entitled to receive a 3 salesbased royalty on all yum china system sales related to our concepts 

in addition to yum china we have other significant relationships on which our success is dependent including our strategic alliance with telepizza group sa which is the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america excluding brazil and portions of europe and our relationship with certain large franchisees such as flynn restaurant group an existing yum franchisee which recently announced its intention to acquire approximately 950 pizza hut us restaurants which would make it the largest operator of pizza hut restaurants in the us any failure to realize the expected benefits of such franchise relationships may adversely impact our business and operating results 

we may not achieve our target development goals including as the result of the covid19 pandemic and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to increase the number of restaurants around the world however we had fewer net restaurant openings and greater permanent restaurant closures during 2020 compared to our recent history and expectations as the result of the covid19 pandemic additionally we experienced higher closures in the pizza hut system during 2020 as a result of our previously announced efforts to accelerate the transformation of the pizza hut restaurant estate to a more modern and deliverybased business and other business model pressures impacting certain pizza hut restaurants the successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand into new markets internationally and we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees including yum china will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and trade or economic policies or sanctions our ability to attract new franchisees construction and development costs of new restaurants and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified management teams and restaurant crews and meet construction schedules 

expansion into markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ willingness to invest capital or ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants or if the perceived return on invested capital is not sufficiently attractive the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the development of new restaurants could impact the sales of our concepts’ existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from past or potential future acquisitions investments or other strategic transactions 

from time to time we evaluate and may complete mergers acquisitions divestitures joint ventures strategic partnerships minority investments which may include minority investments in third parties such as franchisees or master franchisees and other strategic transactions including our acquisition of the habit restaurants inc completed in march 2020 our strategic 

alliance with telepizza group sa effectuated in december 2018 and our acquisition of quikorder llc completed in december 2018 

past and potential future strategic transactions may involve various inherent risks including without limitation 

• expenses delays or difficulties in integrating acquired companies joint venture operations strategic partnerships or investments into our organization including the failure to realize expected synergies andor the inability to retain key personnel 

• diversion of management’s attention from other initiatives andor daytoday operations to effectively execute our growth strategy 

• inability to generate sufficient revenue profit and cash flow from acquired companies joint ventures strategic partnerships or investments 

• the possibility that we have acquired substantial contingent or unanticipated liabilities in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and 

• the possibility that investments we have made may decline significantly in value which could lead to the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquired businesses 

past and potential future strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to operating a global business 

we have significant exposure to the chinese market through our largest franchisee yum china which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our total business is conducted in mainland china particularly with respect to our kfc concept yum china’s business is exposed to risks in mainland china which include among others potential political financial or social instability changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences the regulatory environment including uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws rules and regulations the effect of the covid19 pandemic and related chinese governmental restrictions further any significant or prolonged deterioration in us–china relations including as the result of current us–china tensions could adversely affect our concepts in mainland china chinese law regulates yum china’s business conducted within mainland china our royalty income from the yum china business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on the policies of the chinese government as they may change from time to time if yum china’s business is harmed or development of our concepts’ restaurants is slowed in mainland china due to any of these factors it could negatively impact the royalty paid by yum china to us which would negatively impact our financial results or our growth prospects 

our relationship with yum china is governed primarily by a master license agreement which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of yum china in addition if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in mainland china if yum china is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the master license agreement or if the master license agreement is otherwise terminated it could result in an interruption in the operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to yum china for use in mainland china such interruption could cause a delay in or loss of royalty income to us which would negatively impact our financial results 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us including in emerging markets and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business and the businesses of our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political financial or social instability or conditions geopolitical events corruption antiamerican sentiment social and ethnic unrest and terrorism as well as changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights income and nonincome based tax rates and laws the impact of import restrictions or controls sanctions foreign exchange control regimes including restrictions on currency conversion natural disasters the impact of labor costs and conditions consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our concepts’ restaurants are operated for example we have been subject to a regulatory enforcement action in india alleging violation of foreign exchange laws for failure to satisfy conditions of certain operating approvals such as minimum investment and store build requirements 

as well as limitations on the remittance of fees outside of the country see note 20 in addition we and our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages the imposition of penalties suspension of business licenses or a cessation of operations at our or our franchisees’ businesses as well as damage to our and our concepts’ brands’ images and reputations all of which could harm our profitability and growth prospects 

foreign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results 

our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi “rmb” australian dollar the british pound and the euro as well as currencies in certain other markets such as the malaysian ringgit and russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings any significant fluctuation in the value of currencies of countries in which we or our franchisees operate and in particular rmb in china could materially impact the us dollar value of royalty payments made to us which could result in lower revenues there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition the governments in certain countries where our concepts operate including china restrict the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of the country restrictions on the conversion of rmb to us dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of china could result in delays in the remittance of yum china’s royalty which could impact our liquidity 

risks related to technology data privacy and intellectual property 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees vendors and franchisees in addition our vendors andor franchisees receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our employees and customers the use and handling including security of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts and industry standards we have experienced cyber attacks and security breaches from time to time the number and frequency of these cyberattacks andor security breaches varies between periods but could be exacerbated by an increase in the use of our digital commerce platforms if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or if our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations or fail to meet industry standards and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause interruption of normal business performance cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees do business for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which was adopted by the european union effective may 2018 requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and is subject to changing requirements which could increase company and franchisee resources necessary to comply in addition the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which became effective january 2020 requiring companies that process information on california residents to among other things provide new disclosures and options to consumers about data collection use and sharing practices further the ccpa has been subject to revision and amendments including significant modifications made by the california privacy rights act “cpra” which was recently approved by california voters as a ballot initiative in november 2020 and will take effect january 1 2022 the updates and modifications to the ccpa as well as requirements under the gdpr may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply moreover each of the gdpr and the ccpa confer a private rightofaction on certain individuals and associations our failure or the failure of our franchisees to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr ccpa and other evolving laws and regulations in this area could result in financial penalties legal liability and could damage our and our concepts’ brands’ reputations 

in addition several other states have introduced or passed similar legislation to the ccpa and cpra which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection use and processing activities the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection use dissemination and security of data furthermore various international jurisdictions where our concepts have operations have significantly strengthened their data privacy laws rules and regulations if more restrictive or inconsistent 

legal requirements are adopted by international state andor federal authorities in the future andor regulators’ enforcement priorities shift compliance costs and potential liability could increase for the company and our concepts’ franchisees which could cause reputational harm and have an adverse effect on our business 

unreliable or inefficient restaurant or consumerfacing technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives in the future could adversely impact operating results and the overall consumer experience 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely heavily on information technology systems in the conduct of our business some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including for example pointofsale processing in our restaurants management of our supply chain and various other processes and procedures these systems are subject to damage interruption or failure due to theft fire power outages telecommunications failure computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks or other catastrophic events certain technology systems may also be unreliable or inefficient and technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance which could impact the reliability of critical systems’ operations if our or our concepts’ franchisees’ information technology systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales customer or employee dissatisfaction or negative publicity that could adversely impact our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience sales growth and margin improvement our continued growth will be dependent on our initiatives to implement proprietary and thirdparty technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience it may be difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts due to intense competition for qualified technology systems’ developers necessary to innovate develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives including increasing our digital relationship with customers our strategic technology initiatives may not be implemented in a timely manner or may not achieve the desired results even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives there is no guarantee that this will result in sales growth or margin improvement additionally developing and implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us and our concepts’ franchisees and our concepts franchisees may have differing views on investment priorities moreover our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological advancements and industry trends particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities could result in a loss of customers and related market share if our concepts’ digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security speed attractiveness or ease of use customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms which could negatively impact our business 

there are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms to maintain and grow sales such platforms may experience disruptions which could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business 

customers are increasingly using ecommerce websites and apps both domestically and internationally such as pizzahutcom pizza hut kfc taco bell and the habit burger grill apps as well as apps owned by thirdparty delivery aggregators and thirdparty mobile payment processors to order and pay for our concepts’ products moreover the covid19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the use of storelevel or thirdparty delivery services by our concepts and many restaurants in each of our concepts now offer consumers the ability to have the concept’s food delivered through thirdparty delivery services as a result our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel these digital ordering and payment platforms could be damaged or interrupted by power loss technological failures user errors cyberattacks other forms of sabotage inclement weather or natural disasters the digital ordering platforms relied upon by our concepts have experienced interruptions and could experience further interruptions which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms or make customers less inclined to return to such platforms the rapid acceleration in growth of digital sales has placed additional stress on those platforms that are more reliant upon legacy technology such as certain platforms used by pizza hut which may result in more frequent and potentially more severe interruptions moreover our reliance on multiple digital commerce platforms to support our global footprint multiple concepts and highly franchised business model could increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks andor security breaches and could necessitate additional expenditures as we endeavor to consolidate and standardize such platforms 

yum china our largest franchisee utilizes thirdparty mobile payment apps such as alipay and wechat as a means through which to generate sales and process payments should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in china or should the relationship between yum china and one or more thirdparty mobile payment processors become interrupted our results of operations could be negatively impacted in particular political tensions between the us and china escalated in 2020 with a number of actions taken by the us government such as the clean network program announced on august 5 2020 to protect us telecommunication and technology infrastructure and two executive orders issued by president trump on august 6 2020 to ban within 45 days of such date any person or property subject to the jurisdiction of the us from any transaction related to wechat to the extent that any such transaction is identified by the secretary of commerce as being subject to the prohibitions stated in the executive orders while the directives issued by the secretary of commerce arising from 

the executive orders only identified prohibited transactions that are limited to the territory of the us and therefore are not expected to impact yum chinas operations in china we cannot foresee whether and how similar or additional policy actions taken by the us or chinese governments will impact our business and financial performance if yum china’s ability to use wechat or other thirdparty mobile payment apps in its operations is restricted its business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected which could have a negative impact on the royalty paid to us 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other branddamaging behaviors many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

in addition social media is frequently used by our concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general failure by our concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately particularly as compared to our concepts’ respective competitors could lead to a decline in brand value customer visits and revenue in addition laws and regulations including federal trade commission enforcement are rapidly evolving to govern social media platforms and communications a failure of us our employees our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our concepts’ brands our reputation and our business or subject us or our franchisees to fines or other penalties other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts’ brands exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our concepts’ brands and overall business 

we regard our registered service marks eg yum® kfc® pizza hut® taco bell® and the habit® and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts our service marks and trademarks create brand awareness and help build goodwill among our customers thus we rely on a combination of legal protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from potential infringement many of our trademarks and service marks are registered in the us andor foreign jurisdictions however from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons or companies although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our concepts’ brands and adversely affect our business and goodwill in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or may in the future open or franchise a restaurant and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or the legal protections which may be available will be adequate and defending or enforcing our trademarks service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources or result in significant harm to our business reputation financial condition and overall operations we may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with the use of the proprietary knowhow recipes or trade secrets used in our business defending against such claims is costly and we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages royalties or other fees for using such proprietary information any of which could negatively affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our supply chain and employment 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers although certain products have limited suppliers which increases our reliance on those suppliers we along with our concepts’ franchisees are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our 

concepts’ restaurants have happened from time to time and could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales future shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters pandemics including the covid19 pandemic inaccurate forecasting of customer demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports including due to trade disputes or restrictions the inability of vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which the suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards or requirements transitioning to new suppliers or distributors product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements product recalls the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms or other conditions beyond our control or the control of our concepts’ franchisees 

in addition in the us the company and the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs” which is a thirdparty responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the habit burger grill entered into a purchasing agreement with rscs in 2020 mclane foodservice inc “mclane” serves as the largest distributor for the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts in the us any failure or inability of our significant suppliers or distributors including rscs or mclane to meet their respective service requirements could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies 

the loss of key personnel labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth harm our business and reduce our profitability 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business 

in addition our restaurant operations are highly serviceoriented and our success depends in part upon our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees including franchisee management restaurant managers and other crew members the market for qualified employees in the retail food industry is very competitive our and our concepts’ franchisees may experience a shortage of labor for positions in our restaurants including due to concern over exposure to covid19 and other factors that could decrease the pool of available qualified employees for key functions 

any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay our planned use development or deployment of technology or the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees which could have a material adverse impact on the operation of our concepts’ existing restaurants in addition strikes work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common in the event of a strike work slowdown or other labor unrest the ability to adequately staff our concepts’ restaurants could be impaired which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities 

changes in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees’ results of operations 

an increase in the costs of employee wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees’ operating results such increases in costs could result from general economic or competitive conditions or from government imposition of higher minimum wages at the federal state or local level including the potential increase in the federal minimum wage in the us proposed by the new presidential administration moreover there may be a longterm trend toward higher wages in developing markets any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins in addition competition for qualified employees could compel us or our concepts’ franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain key crew members which could result in higher labor costs and decreased profitability 

an increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins 

our and our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins including poultry pork beef and seafood cheese oil flour and vegetables including potatoes and lettuce raw materials purchased for use in our concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather conditions or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials taxes and tariffs including as a result of trade disputes industry demand food safety concerns product recalls governmental regulation and other factors all of which are beyond our control and in many instances are unpredictable as a result the historical prices of raw materials used in the operation of our concepts’ restaurants have fluctuated we cannot assure that we or our concepts’ franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices or that the 

cost of raw materials will remain stable in the future in addition a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors 

because we and our concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases if we and our concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately our and our franchisees’ profit margins and return on invested capital may be adversely impacted 

risks related to our concepts’ brands and reputation 

our concepts’ brands may be harmed or diluted through franchisee and thirdparty activity 

although we monitor and regulate franchisee activities through our concepts’ franchise agreements franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our concepts’ brands or place our concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation this may result in dilution of or harm to our intellectual property or the value of our concepts’ brands 

franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our concepts’ brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards including with respect to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines in connection with the covid19 pandemic engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices moreover unauthorized third parties including our concepts’ current and former franchisees may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our concepts’ brands resulting in consumer confusion or brand dilution any reduction of our concepts’ brands’ goodwill consumer confusion or brand dilution is likely to impact sales and could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance our corporate reputation and the value and perception of our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food the ingredients we use and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons and some changes can occur rapidly for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that may affect perceptions of our concepts’ brands generally or relative to available alternatives in addition the restaurant industry globally has been subject to claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse effects publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our business moreover these types of claims could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products including legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” which could in turn increase costs of compliance and remediation to us and our franchisees 

in addition business or other incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us our concepts’ restaurants franchisees competitors governments suppliers or distributors can significantly reduce brand value and consumer perception particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or investigations moreover our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain our corporate reputation for example the reputation of our concepts’ brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers distributors or franchisees or by claims or perceptions that we founders of our concepts our concepts’ franchisees or other business partners have acted or are acting in an unethical illegal raciallybiased or socially irresponsible manner or are not fostering an inclusive and diverse environment regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true our corporate reputation could also suffer from negative publicity or consumer sentiment regarding company action or brand imagery a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by any company officer or any employee or representative of us or a franchisee for example entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct including alleged human rights abuses or environmental wrongdoing and any such conduct could damage our or our concepts’ brands’ reputations any such incidents even if resulting from actions of a competitor or franchisee could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts’ brands andor our products and reduce consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits 

there has been an increased public focus including from us and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities on environmental sustainability matters including with respect to climate change greenhouse gases water resources packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use we endeavor to conduct our business in a manner which reflects our priority of sustainable stewardship including with respect to environmental sustainability matters and we are working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain associated with these types of environmental sustainability matters in addition as the result of such heightened public focus on environmental sustainability matters we may face increased pressure to provide expanded disclosure make or expand commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet such goals in connection with such environmental sustainability matters these matters and our efforts to address them could expose us to market operational reputational and execution costs or risks 

risks related to government regulation and litigation 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include regulatory claims or disputes consumer personal injury claims from franchisees employment real estate related tort intellectual property breach of contract securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and these types of lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties some of which are beyond the company’s control unfavorable rulings or developments may also occur in addition the restaurant industry globally has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse effects and we may become subject to such claims in the future moreover regardless of whether any such lawsuits have merit or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle such litigation may be expensive to defend may divert resources and management attention away from our operations and may negatively impact our results of operations with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our concepts’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

the company and our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws and regulations change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

• the americans with disabilities act in the us and similar state laws that provide protection to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas 

• the us fair labor standards act which governs matters such as minimum wages and overtime and the family and medical leave act as well as a variety of similar state laws which provide protected leave rights to employees 

• federal and state employment laws related to workplace health and safety nondiscrimination nonharassment whistleblower protections and other terms and conditions of employment 

• laws and regulations in governmentmandated health care benefits such as the patient protection and affordable care act in the us 

• laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety product marketing and menu labeling 

• uncertainties and effects of laws and regulations associated with the implementation of the uk’s withdrawal of membership from the european union referred to as “brexit” including those relating to tax and trade 

• laws relating to state and local licensing 

• laws relating to the relationship between franchisors and franchisees 

• laws and regulations relating to health sanitation food workplace safety child labor including laws regulating the use of certain “hazardous equipment” building and zoning and fire safety and prevention 

• laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities such as the proposed protecting the right to organize act the “pro act” in the us 

• laws relating to information security privacy including the european union’s gdpr and california’s ccpa and cpra cashless payments and consumer protection 

• laws relating to currency conversion or exchange 

• laws relating to international trade and sanctions 

• tax laws and regulations 

• antibribery and anticorruption laws 

• environmental laws and regulations including with respect to climate change 

• federal and state immigration laws and regulations in the us 

• regulations health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid19 pandemic 

compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our or our concepts’ franchisees’ operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial in addition if any governmental authority were to adopt and implement a broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under laws such as the national labor relations act in a manner that is applied generally to franchise relationships which broader standards in the past have been adopted by us governmental agencies such as the national labor relations board this could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and could subject our concepts to other liabilities andor require our concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our concepts’ franchisees further a california law enacted in 2019 adopted an employment classification test to be used when determining employee or independent contractor status which establishes a high threshold to obtain independent contractor status the proposed federal pro act under review by congress in the us could have similar effects in addition to weakening state “right to work” laws which could result in increased labor disputes and costs borne by our franchisees and us these laws and any similar laws enacted at the federal state or local level could increase our and our franchisees’ labor costs and decrease profitability or could cause employees of our franchisees to be deemed employees of our concepts 

any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial results or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses internal investigations governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues 

failure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business operations 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing emphasis and enforcement around the world there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents franchisees or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines and significant investigation costs and could also materially damage our reputation brands international expansion efforts and growth prospects business and operating results publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

tax matters including changes in tax rates or laws disagreements with taxing authorities imposition of new taxes and our restructurings could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to ongoing andor regular reviews examinations and audits by the us internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience interpretations of applicable law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities but such accruals require significant judgment which may be incorrect and may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties payment of additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax laws and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in laws regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition changes in tax laws or regulations may arise as a result of tax policies proposed by the recently elected us presidential administration changes in tax laws may also arise as a result of tax policy guidance issued by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” a coalition of member nations including the united states the oecd guidance referred to as the base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plan does not have the force of law but certain countries may enact tax legislation modify tax treaties andor increase audit scrutiny based on the beps guidance to the extent beps principles are adopted by major jurisdictions in which we or our concepts operate it could increase our taxes and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position we have in the past and may in the future adapt our entity and operating structure in response to and in compliance with changes in tax laws regulations or interpretation of existing laws and regulations such restructurings could result in material incremental tax costs associated with restructuring transactions or operations of the structure in addition public perception that we are not paying a sufficient amount of taxes could damage our concepts’ reputations which could harm our profitability 

risks related to the yum china spinoff 

the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

we received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions qualified as generally taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code the opinions relied on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings including with respect to future conduct made by yum china and us if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the irs because the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge 

if notwithstanding receipt of any opinion the irs were to conclude that the yum china spinoff was taxable in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the yum china common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition each us holder of our common stock who received shares of yum china common stock in connection with the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of yum china common stock received that distribution would be taxable to each such us stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such us stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

the yum china spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

in february 2015 the chinese state administration of taxation “sat” issued the bulletin on several issues of enterprise income tax on income arising from indirect transfers of property by nonresident enterprises “bulletin 7” pursuant to bulletin 7 an “indirect transfer” of chinese taxable assets including equity interests in a china resident enterprise “chinese interests” by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of chinese taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of chinese enterprise income tax using general antitax avoidance provisions the sat may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of chinese interests if the transfer has avoided chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to chinese enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of up to 10 of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a china resident enterprise 

we evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 in connection with the separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose 

however there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10 assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of yum china as our tax basis in yum china was minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

risks related to consumer discretionary spending and macroeconomic conditions 

our business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and economic conditions in the us and international markets 

as a restaurant company dependent upon consumer discretionary spending we and our franchisees are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty regarding macroeconomic conditions in the us and in other regions of the world where our concepts and concepts’ franchisees operate some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment and underemployment rates fluctuations in the level of disposable income the price of gasoline and other inflationary pressures stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our or our franchisees’ sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results in this regard we and our franchisees have been adversely impacted by and may continue to be adversely impacted by ongoing negative macroeconomic conditions in the us and other regions of the world where our concepts and concepts’ franchisees operate arising from the covid19 pandemic including elevated unemployment and underemployment levels and decreased consumer spending and consumer confidence in addition our business in the us and 

international regions could be adversely impacted by various factors which may be beyond our control including natural disasters geopolitical events terrorism political financial or social instability terrorism boycott social unrest or other events that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our and our franchisees’ restaurants 

risks related to competition 

the retail food industry is highly competitive 

our concepts’ restaurants compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants and the retail food industry in which our concepts operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives including the frequent use by our competitors of price discounting such as through value meal menu options coupons and other methods customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties in addition our concepts compete within the retail food industry for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts andor launch of new products are unsuccessful or if our concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our and our franchisees’ businesses could be adversely affected moreover the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a disruption of consumer routines the implementation of employer “workfromhome” policies reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and it is difficult to fully assess the impacts of such developments on us or our concepts or the extent to which any such consumer patterns may continue after the covid19 pandemic has ended we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas and this trend which has accelerated following the onset of the covid19 pandemic is expected to continue to increase increased competition could have an adverse effect on sales profitability or development plans which could harm our or our franchisees’ financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain 

as of december 31 2020 our total outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt was approximately 108 billion subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt from time to time which would increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness 

specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 

• increasing our vulnerability to and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment including ongoing adverse economic conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividends share repurchases or other corporate purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating which could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates 

• increasing our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as current and future borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest 

• increasing our exposure to the risk of discontinuance replacement or modification of certain reference rates including as the result of the upcoming discontinuance of libor which are used to calculate applicable interest rates of our indebtedness and certain derivative instruments that hedge interest rate risk 

• making it more difficult for us to repay refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increasing the cost of any such borrowing 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations as the result of the terms of our indebtedness which if not complied with could result in an event of default which in turn if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies and 

• increasing our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is primarily denominated in us dollars 

there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs if conditions related to the covid19 pandemic result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets our cost of borrowing our ability to access capital on favorable terms and our overall liquidity could be adversely impacted if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

as a result of the impacts on our business due to the covid19 pandemic certain measures we established as part of our transformation goals were negatively impacted in 2020 for the full year 2020 ga excluding the impact of special items represented 19 of consolidated system sales primarily due to sales pressures resulting from the covid19 pandemic while we took certain austerity measures to reduce ga spending such as lower travel related costs and a reduction of our chief executive officers salary these reductions were offset by accelerated digital and technology spending to enhance our customer experience and offpremise capabilities we expect our ga as a percentage of consolidated system sales to move back toward our historical target of 17 as sustained growth resumes additionally during 2020 our ebitda was negatively impacted by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which increased our consolidated leverage net of available cash we currently estimate we will grow back into our 50x ebitda consolidated net leverage by second quarter 2021 

going forward we expect to 

• maintain a capital structure of 50x ebitda consolidated net leverage 

• invest capital in a manner consistent with an asset light franchisor model and 

• allocate ga in an efficient manner that provides leverage to operating profit growth while at the same time opportunistically investing in strategic growth initiatives 

we intend for this mda to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations including performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following performance metrics 

• samestore sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system for one year or more including those temporarily closed from timetotime restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement rebuilding natural disasters health epidemic or pandemic landlord disputes or other issues throughout 2020 we had a significant number of restaurants that were temporarily closed including restaurants closed due to government and landlord restrictions as a result of covid19 the system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining samestore sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count see below we believe samestore sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our concepts existing store base additionally samestore sales growth is reflective of the strength of our brands the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends in 2020 when calculating samestore sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of our acquisition of the habit restaurants inc on march 18 2020 and that were open for one year or more in 2019 when calculating samestore sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of the telepizza strategic alliance in december 2018 and that were open for one year or more see additional discussion of the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc and telepizza strategic alliance within this mda 

• net new unit growth reflects new unit openings offset by permanent store closures by us and our franchisees to determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another yum unit serves the primary product of one of our concepts operates under a separate franchise agreement if operated by a franchisee and has substantial and sustainable sales we believe net new unit growth is useful to investors because we depend on net new units for a significant portion of our growth additionally net new unit growth is generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our concept restaurants 

• system sales system sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation fx and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53 rd week in 2019 for our us subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly period calendar system sales reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including company 

owned and franchise restaurants sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company at a rate of 3 to 6 of sales increasingly customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts products we also include in system sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts products are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income however any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the companys revenues we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers company and franchise samestore sales as well as net unit growth 

• company restaurant profit restaurant profit is defined as company sales less expenses incurred directly by our companyowned restaurants in generating company sales company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as restaurant profit divided by company sales restaurant profit is useful to investors as it provides a measure of profitability for our companyowned restaurants 

in addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the company provides the following nongaap measurements 

• diluted earnings per share excluding special items as defined below 

• effective tax rate excluding special items 

• core operating profit and core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2019 core operating profit excludes special items and fx and we use core operating profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally 

these nongaap measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of these nongaap measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

special items are not included in any of our division segment results as the company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of special items when assessing segment performance 

certain performance metrics and nongaap measurements are presented excluding the impact of fx these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates we believe the elimination of the fx impact provides better yeartoyear comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 

for 2019 we provided core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019

items impacting reported results andor expected to impact future results 

the following items impacted reported results in 2020 andor 2019 andor are expected to impact future results see also the detail of special items section of this mda for other items similarly impacting results 

covid19 

in late 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was first detected and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic throughout 2020 covid19 has spread throughout the us and the rest of the world and governmental authorities have implemented measures to reduce the spread of covid19 these measures include restrictions on travel outside the home and other limitations on business and other activities as well as encouraging social distancing as a result of covid19 we and our franchisees have experienced significant store closures and instances of reduced storelevel operations including reduced operating hours and diningroom closures 

our results were significantly impacted by the impacts of covid19 in the year ended december 31 2020 as evidenced by our worldwide samestore sales decline of 6 the impact on our sales in each of our markets has been dependent on the timing severity and duration of the outbreak measures implemented by government authorities to reduce the spread of covid19 as well as our reliance on dinein sales in the market overall our sales declines have been primarily driven by temporary store closures which peaked in early april at about 11000 restaurants from that date temporarily closed restaurants gradually reopened until as of the end of our third quarter we had approximately 1100 units temporarily closed we continued to see reopenings through the balance of the fourthquarter however due to the secondwave impacts of covid19 including increased government restrictions temporary closures climbed back to approximately 1000 as of february 4 2021 as a result roughly 98 of our system is currently open in a full or limited capacity geographies experiencing temporary closures have evolved and we are now seeing more closures in europe canada and the middle east offset by some reopenings in latin america and india assets located in malls transportation centers airports and other similar locations continue to be pressured making up many of the temporary closures in addition to the loss of sales due to restaurants being temporarily closed we have also lost sales due to the significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures or other limitations on access we have been able to mitigate the loss of sales due to dining room closures or other limitations on access through the strength of our offpremise channels aided by increasing consumer access to our brands via digital channels our worldwide samestore sales decline of 1 for the fourth quarter of 2020 represents an improvement from the samestore sales declines of 7 15 and 2 in the respective first second and third quarters of 2020 

the covid19 situation is ongoing and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to forecast any impacts on the companys 2021 results the ultimate pace of recovery will largely depend on the pace of restaurant reopenings and the continuation of current sales trends although we expect continuing adverse impacts from covid19 in addition for our restaurants that prominently feature drivethru carryout and delivery options covid19 has in many cases contributed to an increase in sales during 2020 if the impact of covid19 recedes inperson dining restrictions are lifted or lessened and the restaurant industry in general returns to more normal operations the benefits to sales experienced by certain of our restaurants including our pizza hut delivery restaurants could wane and our results could be negatively impacted as 98 of our restaurants are operated by approximately 2000 independent franchisees across the world we are closely monitoring the impact of covid19 on our franchisees financial condition 

net new unit growth 

in addition to the restaurants that have been or continue to be temporarily closed during 2020 the uncertainties associated with covid19 contributed to fewer new restaurant openings and increased permanent restaurant closures during 2020 versus both our recent history and expectations in addition to permanent closures due to the impacts of covid19 the pizza hut system also experienced increased permanent closures of certain asset types primarily due to business model pressures as discussed in the following paragraph for the year ended december 31 2020 our concepts collectively opened 2423 new units while permanently closing 2516 units 

while net new unit growth at each of kfc taco bell and the habit burger grill was lower than expected in 2020 each concept realized positive net new unit growth for the year pizza hut experienced a net new unit decline of 1064 restaurants in 

2020 largely due to 1745 global closures including 867 closures in the us nearly 300 of which were stores operated by npc international inc npc as discussed in the following paragraph these global closures which were largely underperforming or low volume casual diningbased and license units have hastened the transition of the pizza hut system to a more deliveryfocused and modern estate which we believe will optimize our ability to grow the pizza hut system going forward however these and continued closures within our pizza hut division will present a headwind to the divisions net unit and operating profit growth in 2021 

npc our largest pizza hut us franchisee filed voluntary petitions on july 1 2020 to restructure under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas in connection with the bankruptcy filing we consented to up to 300 mutually selected closures of underperforming units primarily dinein assets these units were largely closed during the quarter ended september 30 2020 in january 2021 flynn restaurant group an existing yum franchisee announced its intention to acquire npc’s approximately 950 remaining pizza hut us restaurants

as a result of the impacts of covid19 on the results of habit burger grill’s operations as well as general market conditions we recorded an aftertax impairment charge of 107 million in the first quarter of 2020 related to the goodwill arising from the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition as we continued to refine our preliminary purchase price allocation for habit in the quarter ended september 30 2020 the aftertax impairment charge was adjusted upward by 4 million we have reflected this impairment as a special item resulting in a special item eps charge for the year ended december 31 2020 of approximately 036 see note 3

in 2020 the increase in corporate and unallocated ga expense was driven by charitable contributions of 50 million related to our “unlocking opportunity initiative” and 25 million related to covid19 relief see note 5 the increase was also driven by costs associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to our us based employees and a related worldwide severance program see note 5 higher professional fees including costs associated with the acquisition of the habit burger grill and higher sharebased compensation partially offset by lower expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation programs

net cash used in investing activities was 335 million in 2020 compared to 88 million in 2019 the increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc and lower refranchising proceeds in the current year partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our investment in grubhub inc common stock and lower capital spending 

net cash used in financing activities was 738 million in 2020 compared to 938 million in 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by lower share repurchases partially offset by lower net borrowings 

consolidated financial condition 

our consolidated balance sheet was impacted by the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc see note 3 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated by operations and our revolving facilities as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 730 million we have historically generated substantial cash flows from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment and from the operations of our companyowned stores our annual operating cash flows have historically been in excess of 1 billion decreases in operating cash flows from the operation of fewer companyowned stores in recent years due to refranchising have been offset and are expected to continue to be offset with savings generated from decreased capital investment and ga required to support company operations 

we believe that our existing cash on hand cash from operations and availability under our revolving facility as defined below will be sufficient to fund our operations anticipated capital expenditures and debt repayment obligations over the next twelve months our balance sheet often reflects a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and is also historically common for yum our royalty receivables from franchisees are generally due within 30 days of the period in which the related sales occur and company sales are paid in cash or by credit card which is quickly converted into cash substantial amounts of cash received have historically been either returned to shareholders or invested in new restaurant assets which are noncurrent in nature as part of our working capital strategy we negotiate favorable credit terms with vendors and as a result our onhand inventory turns faster than the related shortterm liabilities accordingly it is not unusual for current liabilities to exceed current assets we believe such a deficit has no significant impact on our liquidity or operations 

during 2020 net cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by lower operating profit due in large part to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic in light of the impacts on our business from the covid19 pandemic the company took the following steps to bolster our cash balance and increase our liquidity position during 2020 

• during the first quarter of 2020 we suspended our share repurchase program pursuant to which the companys board of directors previously authorized repurchases of up to 2 billion of the companys common stock through june 30 2021 the “share repurchase program” commensurate with the performance of the business health of our balance sheet and liquidity position including our repayment of remaining borrowings under our revolving facility during the quarter ended september 30 2020 and our confidence that we will grow back into our 50x ebitda consolidated net leverage target by secondquarter 2021 we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2020 

• on march 24 2020 pizza hut holdings llc kfc holding co and taco bell of america llc collectively the “ borrowers ”  each a whollyowned subsidiary of yum brands inc borrowed 525 million under our existing revolving facility this borrowing together with 425 million borrowed under the revolving facility on march 18 2020 to fund amounts associated with the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc resulted in an aggregate of 950 million outstanding under the revolving facility as of march 31 2020 in the second and third quarters of 2020 we made repayments of 375 million and 575 million respectively and as of both december 31 2020 and september 30 2020 our revolving facility was undrawn the current interest rate for borrowings under the revolving facility is libor plus 150 

• on april 1 2020 yum brands inc issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of 775 yum senior unsecured notes due april 1 2025 see note 11 for more detail 

• on september 25 2020 yum brands inc issued 1050 million aggregate principal amount of 3625 yum senior unsecured notes due march 15 2031 the net proceeds from the issuance together with cash on hand were used to repay 1050 million aggregate principal amount of subsidiary senior unsecured notes due in 2024 see note 11 for more detail 

debt instruments

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2020 included 



a amounts include maturities of debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 and expected interest payments on those outstanding amounts on a nominal basis the estimated interest payments related to the variable rate portion of our debt are based on current libor interest rates see note 11 

b these obligations which are shown on a nominal basis and represent the noncancellable term of the lease relate primarily to approximately 800 companyowned restaurants and 350 units that we sublease land building or both to our franchisees see note 12 

c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction we have excluded agreements that are cancellable without penalty purchase obligations relate primarily to marketing information technology and supply agreements 

d includes actuariallydetermined timing of payments from our most significant unfunded pension plan as well as scheduled payments from our deferred compensation plan and other unfunded benefit plans where payment dates are determinable this table excludes 37 million of future benefit payments for deferred compensation and other unfunded benefit plans to be paid upon separation of employees service or retirement from the company as we cannot reasonably estimate the dates of these future cash payments 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding 

policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from timetotime to improve the plan’s funded status at december 31 2020 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 20 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 78 million at our 2020 measurement date 

we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2021 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2021 and beyond 

our postretirement health care plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 3 million in 2020 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 15 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled see note 20 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table 64 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

as discussed further in note 20 on january 29 2020 we received an order from the special director of the directorate of enforcement in india imposing a penalty on yum restaurants india private limited of approximately indian rupee 11 billion or approximately 150 million primarily relating to alleged violations of operating conditions imposed in 1993 and 1994 we have been advised by external counsel that the order is flawed and have filed a writ petition with the delhi high court which granted an interim stay of the penalty order on march 5 2020 the stay order remains in effect and the next hearing is scheduled for march 24 2021 we deny liability and intend to continue vigorously defending this matter we do not consider the risk of any significant loss arising from this order to be probable

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in march 2020 the fasb issued guidance related to reference rate reform the pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from libor and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates the guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through december 31 2022 we are currently evaluating the impact of the transition from libor to alternative reference rates including the impact on our interest rate swaps as of december 30 2020 our interest rate swaps expiring in july 2021 had notional amounts of 155 billion and our interest rate swaps expiring in march 2025 had notional amounts of 15 billion these interest rate swaps are designated cash flow hedges we do not anticipate the impact of adopting this standard will be material to our financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

business combinations 

the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting or acquisition accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic 805 business combinations the acquisition method of accounting involves the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed this allocation process involves the use of estimates and assumptions to derive fair values and to complete the allocation acquisition accounting allows for up to one year to obtain the information necessary to finalize the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at march 18 2020 we will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired during the remaining measurement period 

as discussed below during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an impairment charge related to habit burger grill reporting unit goodwill resulting from the impacts of covid19 on substantially all habit burger grill restaurants in the event that actual results further vary from any of the estimates or assumptions used in applying the acquisition method of accounting we may be required to record an additional impairment charge or an increase in depreciation or amortization in future periods or both 

see note 3 for additional information about accounting for the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants we intend to continue operating as company restaurants primarily ppe rightofuse operating lease assets and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we writedown the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

in each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 our primary indicator of potential impairment for our restaurant assets was two consecutive years of operating losses for the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic this indicator was expanded to include restaurants that were open less than two years with operating losses as of our annual impairment test this expanded impairment indicator resulted in an increase in the number of store assets reviewed for potential impairment as a result of our annual impairment review we recognized store impairment charges of 12 million which is presented within other income expense in our consolidated statement of income the magnitude of the charges recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 was not particularly sensitive to variations in fair value input as in most situations the fair value of the store assets except the value of any rightofuse lease asset if applicable was fully impaired fair value estimates of rightofuse lease assets in such instances included an estimate of sublease income from a nonfranchisee that could be reasonably obtained which typically resulted in a partial impairment of the rightofuse lease assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level when it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist fair value is an estimate of the 

price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future aftertax cash flows associated with the intangible asset our most significant indefinitelived intangible asset is our habit burger grill brand asset with a book value of 96 million at december 31 2020 as of our fourth quarter 2020 annual impairment testing date the habit burger grills forecasted results have improved from those used in determining the brand asset value as part of the initial valuation at the date of the acquisition and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the habit burger grill brand asset was impaired 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut taco bell and habit burger grill divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from franchise royalties and companyowned restaurant operations if any future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 

future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth from net new units or samestore sales growth and margin improvement for those reporting units which include companyowned restaurant operations assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

other than the habit burger grill reporting unit the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2020 goodwill testing date during the first quarter of 2020 the operations of substantially all habit burger grill restaurants were impacted by covid19 as a result we performed an interim impairment test of the habit burger grill reporting unit goodwill as of march 31 2020 this test of impairment included comparing the estimated fair value of the habit burger grill reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill as originally determined through our preliminary purchase price allocation performed through application of the acquisition method of accounting the fair value estimate of the habit burger grill reporting unit was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and was determined using an income approach through a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs level 3 the most impactful of these inputs included future average unit volumes of habit burger grill restaurants as well as restaurant unit counts the fair value was determined based upon a probabilityweighted average of three scenarios which included assumed recovery of habit burger grill average unit volumes to a pre—covid19 level over periods ranging from the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2022 factors impacting restaurant unit counts were nearterm unit closures as the result of covid19 as well as the pace of expected new unit development unit counts assumed were correlated with the expected recoveries in average unit volumes based upon this fair value estimate we determined that the carrying value of our habit burger grill reporting unit exceeded its fair value as a result during the first quarter of 2020 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 139 million to other income expense and a corresponding income tax benefit of 32 million as we continued to refine our preliminary purchase price allocation in the quarter ended september 30 2020 the impairment charge was adjusted upward by 5 million which resulted in a corresponding income tax benefit of 1 million the amount of the goodwill impairment charge and related tax benefit could change again as we finalize the purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition as of the beginning of our fourth quarter the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment habit’s forecasted results have improved from those relied upon in our march 31 2020 interim impairment test and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the habit burger grill reporting unit was less than its carrying value 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company 

believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2020 refranchising activity completed by the company was limited and the writeoff of goodwill associated with these transactions was less than 1 million 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1133 million and a fair value of plan assets of 1014 million at december 31 2020 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 280 at december 31 2020 the primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or standard  poors sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 71 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 79 million at our measurement date 

the net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2021 is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect net periodic benefit cost plus expected pension settlement charges for our us plans to increase approximately 4 million in 2021 a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our 2020 measurement date would impact our 2021 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 8 million the impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are reflected primarily in other pension income expense 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical and expected future returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2021 pension expense at december 31 2020 was 525 net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2021 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 8 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 525 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 8 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 96 million included in aoci for these us plans at december 31 2020 we will recognize approximately 22 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2021 versus 14 million recognized in 2020 see note 15 

income taxes 

at december 31 2020 we had valuation allowances of approximately 789 million to reduce our 1636 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2020 we had 175 million of unrecognized tax benefits 132 million of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act included a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been provided have now been subject to us tax repatriation of earnings generated after december 31 2017 will generally be eligible for the 100 dividends received deduction or considered a distribution of previously taxed income and therefore exempt from us federal tax undistributed foreign earnings may still be subject to certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes upon repatriation our cash currently held overseas is primarily limited to that necessary to fund working capital requirements thus we have not provided taxes on our foreign unremitted earnings including us state income and foreign withholding taxes as we believe they are indefinitely reinvested see note 18 for a further discussion of our income taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us our outstanding total debt excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts of 107 billion includes 78 fixedrate debt and 22 variablerate debt we have attempted to minimize the interest rate risk from variablerate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that as of december 31 2020 result in a fixed interest rate on 155 billion of our variablerate debt as a result approximately 93 of our 107 billion of outstanding debt at december 31 2020 is effectively fixedrate debt see note 11 for details on our outstanding debt and note 13 for details related to interest rate swaps 

as of both december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swaps in an increase of approximately 8 million in interest expense net within our consolidated statement of income these estimated amounts are based upon the current level of variablerate debt that has not been swapped to fixed and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and exclude any impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 

the fair value of our cumulative fixedrate debt of 84 billion as of december 31 2020 would decrease approximately 475 million as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase at december 31 2020 a hypothetical 100 basispoint decrease in shortterm interest rates would increase the liability associated with the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately 24 million fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the durations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 13 billion as of december 31 2020 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 operating profit would have decreased approximately 115 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

information about operating segments 

as of december 31 2019  yum consists of three operating segments 

 

franchise agreements 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises the company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment capability and capitalization to grow our concepts franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies 

t he company utilizes both storelevel franchise and master franchise programs to grow its businesses of our over 49000 franchised units at december 31 2019  approximately 30 operate under our master franchise programs including over 8800 units in mainland china the remainder of our franchise units operate under storelevel franchise agreements under both types of franchise programs franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business in certain historical refranchising transactions the company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee storelevel franchise agreements typically require payment to the company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants sales typically 4  6 and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand under master franchise arrangements the company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as subfranchise restaurants within certain geographic territories master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of subfranchisees in exchange master franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the subfranchisees under their franchise agreements and typically pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate our largest master franchisee yum china pays the company a continuing fee of 3 on system sales of our concepts in mainland china 

the company seeks to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units can feature dinein carryout drivethru and delivery services nontraditional units include express units and kiosks that have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carryout food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut typically offers delivery service while on a more limited but expanding basis kfc and taco bell allow for consumers to have the concepts food delivered either through storelevel or thirdparty delivery services 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches where sufficient scale allows area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants 

supply and distribution 

the company and franchisees of the concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically the company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available 

in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane foodservice inc is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee stores outside the us we and our concepts franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors our international franchisees generally select and manage their own thirdparty suppliers subject to our internal standards all suppliers and distributors are expected to provide productsservices that comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations in the state andor country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards 

advertising and promotional programs 

companyowned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants’ sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the concepts advertising may be conducted nationally regionally and locally when multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and companyowned stores if any contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants’ sales the contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising market research commercial production talent payments and other support functions for the respective concepts we have the right to control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives typically in markets where we have companyowned stores through our majority voting rights 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks 

the use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not currently considered material to its business

competition 

the retail food industry in which our concepts compete is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including those in the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties competition has also increased from and been enabled by delivery aggregators and other food delivery services in recent years particularly in urbanized areas the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power within the retail food industry each of our concepts competes with international national and regional chains as well as locallyowned establishments not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2019  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends any of the following risk factors either by itself or together with other risk factors could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli listeria salmonella and trichinosis occur or may occur within our system from time to time in addition food safety issues such as food tampering contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts’ restaurants including restaurants operated by us or our concepts’ franchisees or linking our competitors or the retail food industry generally to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation governmental investigations or actions and damages if a customer of one of our concepts’ restaurants becomes ill from food borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or our suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect either our or our concepts’ franchisees’ revenues and profits the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

health concerns arising from the outbreak of a health epidemic or pandemic including the coronavirus may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic including arising from various strains of avian flu or swine flu such as h1n1 or the coronavirus particularly if located in regions from which we derive a significant amount of revenue or profit the occurrence of such an outbreak or other adverse public health developments could materially disrupt our business and operations such events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary closure of restaurants which could severely disrupt our or our franchisees operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in late 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in wuhan china following the outbreak of this virus the chinese government has quarantined certain affected regions and certain travel restrictions have been imposed we have a significant number of kfc and pizza hut concept restaurants located in mainland china operated by our master franchisee yum china many of our restaurants located within mainland china have been temporarily closed have shortened operating hours andor have otherwise been adversely affected by the impact of the coronavirus and these developments have also impacted the ability of yum 

chinas suppliers to provide food and other needed supplies at our concepts’ restaurants in mainland china additionally other nearby franchisees such as those in hong kong and taiwan have experienced significant sales declines as well we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have on our results of operations due to uncertainties including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus within and outside of china the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the coronavirus or to treat its impact however while it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments we expect our results for the quarter ending march 31 2020 to be significantly impacted with potential continuing adverse impacts beyond march 31 2020 

in addition our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu or other illnesses such as hepatitis a norovirus or coronavirus since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world and such outbreaks have resulted in confirmed human cases it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products because poultry is a menu offering for our concepts this would likely result in lower revenues and profits for us and our concepts’ franchisees avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact profit margins and revenues for us and our concepts franchisees 

furthermore other viruses may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures impose restrictions on operations of restaurants or restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results and growth strategies are closely and increasingly tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

the vast majority 98 of our restaurants are operated by our concepts’ franchisees and our percentage of franchiseowned restaurants has increased in recent years our refranchising efforts have increased our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our concepts’ franchisees in addition our longterm system sales growth targets depend on maintaining the pace of our net system unit growth rate nearly all of this unit growth is expected to result from new unit openings by our concepts’ franchisees we increasingly also rely on master franchisees who have rights to license to subfranchisees the right to develop and operate restaurants to achieve our expectations for new unit development if our concepts’ franchisees and master franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development we may fall short of our system sales targets in addition we have franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business such as our relationship with yum china as described in a subsequent risk factor below our strategic alliance with telepizza group sa who is the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america excluding brazil and portions of europe and our relationship with certain large franchisees such as npc international inc the largest operator of pizza hut restaurants in the united states any failure to realize the expected benefits of such franchise relationships may adversely impact our business and operating results 

we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased fees paid to us for royalties advertising funds contributions and other discrete services we may provide to our concept’s franchisees eg management of ecommerce platform if our concepts’ franchisees fail to adequately capitalize their businesses or incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in their financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy or the inability to meet development targets or obligations if a significant franchisee of one of our concepts becomes or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees in the aggregate become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed fee payments that cause us to record bad debt expense reduced advertising fund contributions and reduced new unit development in addition we are secondarily liable on certain of our concepts’ franchisees’ restaurant lease agreements including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with the refranchising of certain companyowned restaurants our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties to the extent our concepts’ franchisees default on such lease agreements in addition the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and the development of new restaurants which in turn could hurt our business 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our concepts’ franchisees to implement marketing programs and major initiatives such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades which may require financial investment our concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the company additionally the failure of our 

concepts’ franchisees to focus on key elements of restaurant operations such as quality service and cleanliness even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents may be attributed by guests to our concepts’ entire brand and could have a negative impact on our business 

our reliance on master franchise arrangements can decrease our level of control over our concepts restaurants and increase certain risks arising from franchise operations for example we rely on our master franchisees to monitor and enforce subfranchisee compliance with our operating standards and a failure to comply with such standards could adversely affect our business 

we may not achieve our target development goals aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to increase the number of restaurants around the world the successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand into new markets internationally and we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees including yum china will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and trade or economic policies or sanctions our ability to attract new franchisees construction and development costs of new restaurants and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified management teams and restaurant crews and meet construction schedules 

expansion into markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ willingness to invest capital or ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants or if the perceived return on invested capital is not sufficiently attractive the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the development of new restaurants could impact the sales of our concepts’ existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

we have significant exposure to the chinese market through our largest franchisee yum china which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our total business is conducted in mainland china particularly with respect to our kfc concept in connection with the spinoff of our china business in 2016 into an independent publiclytraded company the separation or “yum china spinoff” we entered into a master license agreement with yum china pursuant to which yum china is the exclusive licensee of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in mainland china following the separation yum china became and continues to be our largest franchisee our financial results are significantly affected by yum china’s results as we are entitled to receive a 3 salesbased royalty on all yum china system sales related to our concepts yum chinas business is exposed to risks in mainland china which include among others potential political financial or social instability changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences the regulatory environment including uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws rules and regulations and tax laws and regulations including the tax treatment of the royalty paid to yum as well as increased media scrutiny of our concepts and industry fluctuations in foreign exchange rates increased restrictions or tariffs on imported supplies as a result of trade disputes any epidemics or pandemics arising out of mainland china and increased competition further any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our concepts in mainland china if chinese consumers reduce the frequency of their visits to yum china’s restaurants chinese law regulates yum chinas business conducted within mainland china our royalty income from the yum china business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on the policies of the chinese government as they may change from time to time if yum china’s business is harmed or development of our concepts’ restaurants is slowed in mainland china due to any of these factors it could negatively impact the royalty paid by yum china to us which would negatively impact our financial results or our growth prospects 

our relationship with yum china is governed primarily by a master license agreement which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of yum china in addition if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in mainland china if yum china is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the master license agreement or if the master license agreement is otherwise terminated it could result in an interruption in the 

operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to yum china for use in mainland china such interruption could cause a delay in or loss of royalty income to us which would negatively impact our financial results 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us including in emerging markets and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business and the businesses of our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political financial or social instability or conditions corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest as well as changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights income and nonincome based tax rates and laws the impact of import restrictions or controls sanctions foreign exchange control regimes including restrictions on currency conversion natural disasters the impact of labor costs and conditions consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our concepts restaurants are operated for example we have been subject to a regulatory enforcement action in india alleging violation of foreign exchange laws for failure to satisfy conditions of certain operating approvals such as minimum investment and store build requirements as well as limitations on the remittance of fees outside of the country see note 19 in addition we and our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages the imposition of penalties suspension of business licenses or a cessation of operations at our or our franchisees’ businesses as well as damage to our and our concepts’ brands’ images and reputations all of which could harm our profitability 

foreign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results 

our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi “rmb” australian dollar the british pound and the euro as well as currencies in certain other markets such as the malaysian ringgit and russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition the governments in certain countries where we operate including china restrict the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of the country yum china’s income is almost exclusively derived from the earnings of its chinese subsidiaries with substantially all revenues of its chinese subsidiaries denominated in rmb any significant fluctuation in the value of the rmb could materially impact the us dollar value of royalty payments made to us by yum china which could result in lower revenues in addition restrictions on the conversion of rmb to us dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of china could result in delays in the remittance of yum china’s royalty which could impact our liquidity 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees vendors and franchisees in addition our vendors andor franchisees receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our employees and customers the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts we have experienced cyber attacks and security breaches from time to time if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or if our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees do business for example the general data protection regulation gdpr which was adopted by the european union effective may 2018 requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which became effective january 2020 and requires companies that process information on california residents to among other things provide new disclosures and options to consumers about data collection use and sharing practices 

moreover each of the gdpr and the ccpa confer a private rightofaction on certain individuals and associations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr ccpa and other evolving laws and regulations in this area could result in financial penalties legal liability and could damage our and our concepts’ brands’ reputations 

unreliable or inefficient restaurant or consumerfacing technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives in the future could adversely impact operating results 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely heavily on information technology systems in the conduct of our business some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including for example pointofsale processing in our restaurants management of our supply chain and various other processes and procedures these systems are subject to damage interruption or failure due to theft fire power outages telecommunications failure computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks or other catastrophic events certain technology systems may also be unreliable or inefficient and technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance which could impact the reliability of critical systems operations if our or our concepts franchisees information technology systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales customer or employee dissatisfaction or negative publicity that could negatively impact our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience sales growth and margin improvement execution of our growth strategy will be dependent on our initiatives to implement proprietary and thirdparty technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience we may not be able recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts and there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives including increasing our digital relationships with customers our strategic technology initiatives may not be implemented in a timely manner or may not achieve the desired results even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives they may not result in sales growth or margin improvement additionally implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us and our concepts’ franchisees moreover our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities could result in a loss of customers and related market share if our concepts’ digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security speed attractiveness or ease of use customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms which could negatively impact our business 

there are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms to maintain and grow sales such platforms may experience disruptions which could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business 

customers are increasingly using ecommerce websites and apps both domestically and internationally like pizzahutcom pizza hut kfc and taco bell apps as well as apps owned by thirdparty delivery aggregators such as grubhub and thirdparty mobile payment processors to order and pay for our concepts’ products as a result our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel these digital ordering and payment platforms could be damaged or interrupted by power loss technological failures user errors cyberattacks other forms of sabotage or acts of god in particular pizza hut relies on digital orders for a significant portion of its sales and could experience and has experienced interruptions of its digital ordering platforms which limited or delayed customers’ ability to order through such platforms or made customers less inclined to return to such platforms any such limitation or delay would negatively impact pizza hut’s sales and customer experience and perception 

yum china our largest franchisee utilizes thirdparty mobile payment apps such as alipay and wechat as a means through which to generate sales and process payments should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in china or should the relationship between yum china and one or more thirdparty mobile payment processors become interrupted our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such 

platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

in addition social media is frequently used by our concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general failure by our concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately particularly as compared to our concepts’ respective competitors could lead to a decline in brand value customer visits and revenue other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts’ brands exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers although certain products have limited suppliers which increases our reliance on those suppliers we along with our concepts’ franchisees are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our concepts’ restaurants have happened from time to time and could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants future shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters inaccurate forecasting of customer demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports including due to trade disputes the inability of vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which the suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards or requirements transitioning to new suppliers or distributors product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements product recalls the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms or other conditions beyond our control or the control of our concepts’ franchisees 

moreover the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union which occurred effective as of january 31 2020 to be followed by a transition period which is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 unless otherwise extended in which the united kingdom and the european union will negotiate the terms of this withdrawal may give to rise to economic financial legal tax and trade uncertainties that may adversely impact us and could depending on the terms negotiated during the transition period result in the reimposition of customs and border controls which in turn may result in shortages or interruptions in supply to our concepts in the united kingdom with consequences similar to those described above 

in addition in the us the company along with representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is a thirdparty responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment and mclane foodservice inc mclane serves as the largest distributor for each of the company’s concepts in the us any failure or inability of our significant suppliers or distributors including rscs or mclane to perform could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies 

a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a key supplier or distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new supplier or distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

the loss of key personnel or labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth harm our business and reduce our profitability 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business 

in addition our restaurant operations are highly serviceoriented and our success depends in part upon our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees including franchisee management restaurant managers and other crew members the market for qualified employees in the retail food industry is very competitive any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay our planned use development or deployment of technology or the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees which could have a material adverse impact on the operation of our concepts’ existing restaurants 

in addition strikes work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common in the event of a strike work slowdown or other labor unrest the ability to adequately staff our concepts’ restaurants could be impaired which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities 

changes in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees’ results of operations 

an increase in the costs of employee wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our and our franchisees’ operating results such increases could result from general economic or competitive conditions or from government imposition of higher minimum wages at the federal state or local level moreover there may be a longterm trend toward higher wages in developing markets any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins in addition competition for qualified employees could also compel us or our concepts’ franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain key crew members which could result in higher labor costs and decreased profitability 

an increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins 

our and our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins including poultry pork beef and seafood cheese oil flour and vegetables including potatoes and lettuce raw materials purchased for use in our concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather conditions or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials taxes and tariffs including as a result of trade disputes industry demand food safety concerns product recalls governmental regulation and other factors all of which are beyond our control and in many instances are unpredictable as a result the historical prices of raw materials used in the operation of our concepts’ restaurants have fluctuated we cannot assure that we or our concepts’ franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices or that the cost of raw materials will remain stable in the future in addition a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors 

because we and our concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases if we and our concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately our and our franchisees’ profit margins may be adversely impacted 

our concepts’ brands may be harmed or diluted through franchisee and thirdparty activity 

although we monitor and regulate franchisee activities through our concepts’ franchise agreements franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our concepts’ brands or place our concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation this may result in dilution of or harm to our intellectual property or the value of our concepts’ brands 

franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our concepts’ brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices moreover unauthorized third parties including our concepts’ current and former franchisees may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our concepts’ brands resulting in consumer confusion or brand dilution any reduction of our concepts’ brands’ goodwill consumer confusion or brand dilution is likely to impact sales and could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ loyalty to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food the ingredients we use and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons and some changes can occur rapidly for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that may affect perceptions of our concepts’ brands generally or relative to available alternatives in addition business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us our concepts’ restaurants franchisees competitors governments suppliers or distributors can significantly reduce brand value 

and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or investigations for example our concepts’ brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers distributors or franchisees or that we our concepts’ franchisees or other business partners are acting in an unethical illegal raciallybiased or socially irresponsible manner regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true similarly entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct including alleged human rights abuses or environmental wrongdoing and any such conduct could damage our or our concepts’ brands’ reputations any such incidents even if resulting from actions of a competitor or franchisee could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts’ brands andor our products and reduce consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits additionally our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or an employee or representative of us or a franchisee 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include regulatory claims or disputes consumer personal injury claims from franchisees employment real estate related tort intellectual property breach of contract securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties some of which are beyond the company’s control and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur moreover regardless of whether any such claims have merit or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle such litigation may be expensive to defend may divert resources and management attention away from our operations and may negatively impact our results of operations with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations moreover any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our concepts’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the restaurant industry around the world has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse effects we may also be subject to such claims in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations moreover these could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products including legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” which could increase costs of compliance and remediation to us and our franchisees 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

the company and our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 



 

compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our or our concepts’ franchisees’ operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial in addition if any governmental authority were to adopt and implement a broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under laws such as the national labor relations act in a manner that is applied generally to franchise relationships which broader standards in the past have been adopted by us governmental agencies such as the national labor relations board this could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and could subject our concepts to other liabilities andor require our concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our concepts’ franchisees further a recentlyenacted law in california sets out an employment classification test that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status this law and any similar laws enacted at the federal state or local level could increase our and our franchisees’ labor costs and decrease profitability or could cause our franchisees to be deemed employees of our concepts 

any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial results or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses internal investigations governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues 

additionally we are working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources these risks include the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters such as packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them these risks could expose us to market operational reputational and execution costs or risks 

failure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business operations 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing emphasis and enforcement around the world there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines and significant investigation costs and could also materially damage our reputation brands international expansion efforts and growth prospects business and operating results publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

tax matters including changes in tax rates or laws disagreements with taxing authorities imposition of new taxes and our restructurings could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to ongoing andor regular reviews examinations and audits by the us internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience interpretations of applicable law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities but such accruals require significant judgment which may be incorrect and may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties payment of additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax laws and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in laws regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition changes in tax laws may arise as a result of tax policy guidance issued by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” a coalition of member nations including the united states the oecd guidance referred to as the base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plan does not have the force of law but certain countries may enact tax legislation 

modify tax treaties andor increase audit scrutiny based on the beps guidance to the extent beps principles are adopted by major jurisdictions in which we operate it could increase our taxes and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position we have in the past and may in the future adapt our entity and operating structure in response to and in compliance with changes in tax laws regulations or interpretation of existing laws and regulations such restructurings could result in material incremental tax costs associated with restructuring transactions or operations of the structure in addition public perception that we are not paying a sufficient amount of taxes could damage our concepts’ reputations which could harm our profitability 

the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

we received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions qualified as generally taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code the opinions relied on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings including with respect to future conduct made by yum china and us if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the irs because the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge 

if notwithstanding receipt of any opinion the irs were to conclude that the yum china spinoff was taxable in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the yum china common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition each us holder of our common stock who received shares of yum china common stock in connection with the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of yum china common stock received that distribution would be taxable to each such us stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such us stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

the yum china spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

in february 2015 the chinese state administration of taxation “sat” issued the bulletin on several issues of enterprise income tax on income arising from indirect transfers of property by nonresident enterprises “bulletin 7” pursuant to bulletin 7 an “indirect transfer” of chinese taxable assets including equity interests in a china resident enterprise “chinese interests” by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of chinese taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of chinese enterprise income tax using general antitax avoidance provisions the sat may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of chinese interests if the transfer has avoided chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to chinese enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of up to 10 of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a china resident enterprise 

we evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 in connection with the separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose 

however there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10 assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of yum china as our tax basis in yum china was minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our yum® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the us and foreign jurisdictions however from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement 

further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or may in the future open or franchise a restaurant and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or the legal protections which may be available will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources or result in significant harm to our business reputation financial condition and results of operations we may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with the use of the proprietary knowhow recipes or trade secrets used in our business defending against such claims may be costly and we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages royalties or other fees for using such proprietary information any of which could negatively affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions 

our and our franchisees results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve and are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment and underemployment rates fluctuations in the level of disposable income the price of gasoline and other inflationary pressures stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our or our franchisees’ sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

our concept restaurants compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants and the retail food industry in which our concepts operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives including the frequent use by our competitors of price discounting such as through value meal menu options coupons and other methods customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties in addition our concepts compete within the retail food industry for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts andor launch of new products are unsuccessful or if our concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our and our franchisees businesses could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas and is expected to continue to increase increased competition could have an adverse effect on sales profitability or development plans which could harm our or our franchisees’ financial condition and operating results 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from past or potential future acquisitions investments or other strategic transactions 

from time to time we evaluate and may complete mergers acquisitions divestitures joint ventures strategic partnerships minority investments which may include minority investments in third parties such as franchisees or master franchisees and other strategic transactions including our pending acquisition of the habit restaurants inc in respect of which a definitive agreement was signed in january 2020 our strategic alliance with telepizza group sa effectuated in december 2018 our acquisition of quikorder llc completed in december 2018 and our minority investment in grubhub inc completed in april 2018 while we currently contemplate that the acquisition of the habit restaurants inc will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2020 there is no guarantee that this acquisition will be completed on this time frame or at all 

past and potential future strategic transactions may involve various inherent risks including without limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

past and potential future strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we account for certain investments including our investment in grubhub on a marktomarket basis and as a result changes in the fair value of these investments impact our reported results changes in market prices for equity securities are unpredictable and our investment in grubhub has caused and could continue to cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations 

our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain 

as of december 31 2019 our total outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt was approximately 106 billion subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt from time to time which would increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness 

specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 

 

there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

these nongaap measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of these nongaap measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

special items are not included in any of our division segment results as the company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of special items when assessing segment performance 

certain nongaap measurements are presented excluding the impact of fx these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates we believe the elimination of the fx impact provides better yeartoyear comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 

for 2019 we provided core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and system sales excluding the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019

impact of coronavirus outbreak 

since the beginning of 2020 the novel coronavirus outbreak in mainland china has significantly impacted the operations of our largest master franchisee yum china who pays us a continuing fee of 3 on system sales of our concepts in mainland china these continuing fees represented approximately 20 of the kfc division and 16 of the ph division operating profits in the year ended december 31 2019 through the date of the filing of this form 10k yum china has experienced widespread store closures and significant sales declines as a result of the coronavirus additionally other nearby franchisees such as those in hong kong and taiwan have experienced significant sales declines as well while our concepts outside of china have not experienced the same levels of samestore sales declines or store closures to date that yum china has experienced there can be no assurance that the impacts of the coronavirus will not have a material adverse impact on our and our franchisees’ results on a more widespread basis the coronavirus situation is ongoing and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to forecast any impacts on the company’s 2020 results with any certainty however as of the date of this filing we expect our results for the quarter ending march 31 2020 to be significantly impacted with potential continuing adverse impacts beyond march 31 2020 

pizza hut us franchisee issues 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the pizza hut division recorded 22 million in bad debt expense primarily associated with the nearly 600 million in continuing and initial fees earned in 2019 from franchisees this represented an increase of 12 million versus the bad debt provision within the division for the year ended december 31 2018 the increased bad debt was largely attributable to a small number of us franchisees who are facing financial challenges due to unitlevel economics that have been pressured by wage increases and recent us samestore sales declines of 1 in 2019 including a decline of 4 in the fourth quarter of 2019 additionally certain pizza hut us franchisees are burdened by high debt service levels 

we continue to believe that the move of the pizza hut us system to a more deliveryfocused and modern estate will optimize our ability to grow the pizza hut us system going forward however we could see impacts to our nearterm results as we work through transitions of the estate and of certain franchise stores to new franchisees these impacts could include expense related to further bad debts and payments we may be required to make with regard to franchisee lease obligations for which we remain secondarily liable additionally pizza hut us system sales could be negatively impacted by decreased system advertising spend due to lower franchisee contributions and closures of underperforming units including certain units that are largely dinein focused given the fluid nature of issues surrounding our pizza hut us franchisees in particular surrounding our largest pizza hut us franchisee who owns approximately 1225 units or 17 of the pizza hut us system as of december 31 2019 the potential impact to the company’s 2020 results is difficult to forecast 

refranchising initiatives 

during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we recorded net refranchising gains of 37 million 540 million and 1083 million respectively we have reflected those refranchising gains and losses that were recorded in connection with or prior to our previously announced plans to have at least 98 franchise restaurant ownership by the end of 2018 as special items in 

2019 net refranchising gains reflected as special items included 12 million associated with sales of underlying real estate associated with stores that were franchised as of december 31 2018 or trueups to refranchising gains and losses recorded prior to december 31 2018 all net refranchising gains recorded in 2018 and 2017 were reflected as special items 

additionally during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded net refranchising gains of 25 million that have not been reflected as special items these net gains relate to the refranchising of restaurants in 2019 that were not part of and arose subsequent to our aforementioned plans to achieve 98 franchise ownership 

investment in grubhub 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recognized pretax expense of 77 million and pretax income of 14 million respectively related to changes in fair value in our investment in grubhub inc grubhub see note 4 for further discussion of our investment in grubhub 

telepizza strategic alliance 

on december 30 2018 the company consummated a strategic alliance with telepizza group sa “telepizza” the largest non usbased pizza delivery company in the world to be the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america and portions of europe the key terms of the alliance are set forth below 

 

as a result of the alliance we added approximately 1300 telepizza units to our pizza hut division unit count on december 30 2018 in total approximately 2300 pizza hut and telepizza units are subject to the master franchise agreement as of december 31 2019 

based upon our ongoing and active maintenance of the pizza hut intellectual property as well as telepizza’s active involvement in supply chain management and their role as a master franchisee both parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the alliance as a result the alliance has been identified as a collaborative arrangement and upon consummation of the alliance no amounts were recorded in our consolidated financial statements other than insignificant success fees that were paid to thirdparty advisors subsequent to consummation of the deal for all pizza hut restaurants that are part of the alliance we are receiving a continuing fee of 35 of restaurant sales likewise for most telepizza restaurants that are part of the alliance we are receiving an alliance fee of 35 of restaurant sales these fees are being recorded as franchise and property revenues within our consolidated statement of income when the related sales occur consistent with our recognition of continuing fees for all other restaurants subject to our franchise agreements these fees are reduced by a salesbased credit that decreases over time and potentially certain incentive payments if development or conversion targets are met previously the existing pizza hut restaurants that are now subject to the master franchise agreement with telepizza generally paid a continuing fee of 6 of restaurant sales consistent with our standard international franchise agreement terms the impact to operating profit for the year ended december 31 2019 as a result of the strategic alliance was not significant system sales growth in 2019 excluding foreign currency and 53rd week was approximately 1 and 5 percentage points higher for worldwide and the pizza hut division respectively as a result of the strategic alliance additionally net new unit growth in 2018 was approximately 3 and 8 percentage points higher for worldwide and the pizza hut division respectively as a result of the strategic alliance 

kfc united kingdom uk supply availability issues 

on february 14 2018 we and our franchisees transitioned to a new distributor for the products supplied to our approximately 900 kfcs in the united kingdom and ireland those restaurants accounted for approximately 3 of yum’s global system sales in the year ended december 31 2018 in connection with this transition certain of the restaurants experienced supply availability issues which resulted in store closures or stores operating under a limited menu beginning midmay 2018 all restaurants opened for business offering their full menus with advertising beginning at the end of may on a fullyear basis in 2018 we estimated the negative impact to core operating profit growth was 2 percentage points for kfc division and 1 percentage point for yum 

respectively and the negative impact to samestore sales growth was 50 basis points for kfc division and 25 basis points for yum respectively as a result of these supply availability issues

net cash provided by operating activities was 1315 million in 2019 compared to 1176 million in 2018 the increase was largely driven by an increase in operating profit before special items and lower compensation payments partially offset by an increase in interest payments 

net cash used in investing activities was 88 million in 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 313 million in 2018 the change was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds in the current year partially offset by the lapping of our prior year investment in grubhub common stock and the acquisition of quikorder llc an online ordering software and service provider for the restaurant industry quikorder see note 9 

net cash used in financing activities was 938 million in 2019 compared to 2620 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily driven by lower share repurchases and higher net borrowings in 2019 

consolidated financial condition 

our consolidated balance sheet was impacted by the adoption of topic 842 see note 2 and deferred tax assets recorded related to the intercompany transfers of certain intellectual property rights see note 17 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving facilities as of december 31 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of 605 million cash and cash equivalents increased from 292 million at december 31 2018 due to the issuance of 800 million aggregate principal amount of yum senior unsecured notes in september 2019 we have historically generated substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment our annual operating cash flows have historically been in excess of 1 billion decreases in operating cash flows from the operation of fewer companyowned stores due to refranchising in recent years have been offset and are expected to continue to be offset with savings generated from decreased capital investment and ga required to support company operations to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds do not cover our anticipated cash needs we maintain a 1 billion revolving facility under our existing credit agreement that was undrawn as of year end 2019 we believe that our existing cash on hand cash from operations and availability under our revolving facility will be sufficient to fund our operations anticipated capital expenditures and debt repayment obligations over the next twelve months 

from 2017 through 2019 we returned a cumulative 65 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends we funded these shareholder returns through a combination of refranchising proceeds free cash flow generation and maintenance of our 50x ebitda leverage from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the end of 2018 we generated total gross refranchising proceeds of 28 billion in connection with our initiative to increase franchise ownership to 98 going forward we anticipate refranchising proceeds to be much more limited and any shareholder returns we choose to make to be funded through cash flows from operations and leverage maintenance 

on january 6 2020 we announced our definitive agreement pursuant to which the company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of the habit restaurants inc “habit” for 14 per share in cash or a total of approximately 375 million the transaction is subject to approval by habit’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the firstquarter of 2020 

additionally if the transaction is consummated habit will make payment to certain of its former shareholders pursuant to an existing tax receivable agreement in the aggregate amount of approximately 53 million the amount of this payment in excess of habit’s cash necessary at closing for normal working capital purposes in addition to customary transaction fees and expenses will be liabilities funded by the company 

we intend to fund all amounts for the acquisition of habit using cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our revolving facility 

our balance sheet often reflects a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and is also historically common for yum our royalty receivables from franchisees are generally due within 30 days of the period in which the related sales occur and company sales are paid in cash or by credit card which is quickly converted into cash substantial amounts of cash received have historically been either returned to shareholders or invested in new restaurant assets which are noncurrent in nature as part of our working capital strategy we negotiate favorable credit terms with vendors and as a result our onhand inventory turns faster than the related shortterm liabilities accordingly it is not unusual for current liabilities to exceed current assets we believe such a deficit has no significant impact on our liquidity or operations 

debt instruments 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 92 including the impact of interest rate swaps of our 106 billion of total debt outstanding excluding finance leases is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 47 we are managing a capital structure which is levered inline with our target of 50x ebitda and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years we have credit ratings of bb standard  poorsba2 moodys with a balance sheet consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies 

the following table summarizes the future maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts as of december 31 2019

see note 10 for details on the securitization notes the credit agreement subsidiary senior unsecured notes and yum senior unsecured notes  

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2019 included 



 

 

 

 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from timetotime to improve the plan’s funded status at december 31 2019 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 44 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 82 million at our 2019 measurement date 

we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2020 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes 

in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2020 and beyond 

our postretirement health care plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 5 million in 2019 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table 56 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

as discussed further in note 19 on january 29 2020 we received an order from the special director of the directorate of enforcement in india imposing a penalty on yum restaurants india private limited of approximately indian rupee 11 billion or approximately 156 million primarily relating to alleged violations of operating conditions imposed in 1993 and 1994 we have been advised by external counsel that the order is flawed and that several options for appeal exist we deny liability and intend to continue vigorously defending this matter we do not consider the risk of any significant loss arising from this order to be probable and thus have not recorded any reserve at december 31 2019 it is possible that we could be required to post a deposit for some or all portion of the penalty amount as we pursue appeal options we have not included any potential deposit amount in the contractual obligations table as we cannot reliably estimate the timing or amount of any such deposit that may be required 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

see the lease guarantees section of note 19 for discussion of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a standard that requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held the standard is effective for the company prospectively in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and any impact upon adoption will be reflected through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of 2020 we do not anticipate the impact of adopting this standard will be material to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants we intend to continue operating as company restaurants primarily ppe rightofuse operating lease assets and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we writedown the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level when it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from franchise royalties and companyowned restaurant operations if any 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth from net new units or samesales growth and margin improvement for those reporting units which include companyowned restaurant operations assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2019 goodwill testing date 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2019 refranchising activity completed by the company was limited and the writeoff of goodwill associated with these transactions was less than 1 million 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1015 million and a fair value of plan assets of 886 million at december 31 2019  

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 350 at december 31 2019  the primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or standard  poors sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 64 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 71 million at our measurement date 

the net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2020 is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect net periodic benefit cost plus expected pension settlement charges for our us plans to increase approximately 10 million in 2020  a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our 2019 measurement date would impact our 2020 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 6 million the impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are reflected primarily in other pension income expense 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical and expected future returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2020 pension expense at december 31 2019 was 550 net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2020 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 8 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 550 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 8 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 118 million included in aoci for these us plans at december 31 2019  we will recognize approximately 14 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2020 versus 1 million recognized in 2019 see note 14 

income taxes 

at december 31 2019 we had valuation allowances of approximately 787 million to reduce our 1517 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2019 we had 188 million of unrecognized tax benefits 8 million of which are temporary in nature and if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act included a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been provided have now been subject to us tax our cash currently held overseas is primarily limited to that necessary to fund working capital requirements thus we have not provided taxes on our foreign unremitted earnings including us state income and foreign withholding taxes as we believe they are indefinitely reinvested see note 17 for a further discussion of our income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and the value of our equity investment in grubhub in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us our outstanding total debt excluding finance leases of 106 billion includes 77 fixedrate debt and 23 variablerate debt we have attempted to minimize the interest rate risk from variablerate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that as of december 31 2019  result in a fixed interest rate on 155 billion of our variable rate debt as a result approximately 92 of our 106 billion of outstanding debt at december 31 2019 is effectively fixedrate debt see note 10 for details on these issuances and repayments and note 12 for details related to interest rate swaps 

as of both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swaps in an increase of approximately 9 million in interest expense net within our consolidated statement of income these estimated amounts are based upon the current level of variablerate debt that has not been swapped to fixed and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and exclude any impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 

the fair value of our cumulative fixedrate debt of 82 billion as of december 31 2019  would decrease approximately 450 million as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase at december 31 2019  a hypothetical 100 basispoint decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swaps approximately 66 million fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the durations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 12 billion as of december 31 2019  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 operating profit would have decreased approximately 130 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors 

equity investment risk 

yum holds 2820464 shares of grubhub common stock see note 4 as of december 31 2019  the nyse composite closing sales price of grubhub was 4864 a hypothetical 10 decline in the price of these shares would result in a 14 million decrease in the fair value of these investments which would be reflected as a charge in investment income expense net within our consolidated statements of income the effects of changes in market prices for equity securities are unpredictable which could cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results

unit information includes 1282 units operating under the telepizza brand as of december 31 2018 see part ii item 7 for a description of the telepizza strategic alliance 

kfc

four growth drivers form the basis of yum’s strategic plans and repeatable business model to accelerate samestore sales growth and net new restaurant development at kfc pizza hut and taco bell around the world over the long term the company is focused on becoming bestinclass in 

 

information about operating segments 

as of december 31 2018 yum consists of three operating segments 

 

franchise agreements 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises the company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment capability and capitalization to grow our concepts franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies 

t he company utilizes both storelevel franchise and master franchise programs to grow its businesses of our over 47000 franchised units at december 31 2018 approximately 30 operate under our master franchise programs primarily units in china and those operating under the telepizza strategic alliance see part ii item 7 for a description of the telepizza strategic alliance the remainder of our franchise units operate under storelevel franchise agreements under both types of franchise programs franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business in certain historical refranchising transactions the company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee storelevel franchise agreements typically require payment to the company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants sales typically 4  6 and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand under master franchise arrangements the company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as subfranchise restaurants within certain geographic territories master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of subfranchisees in exchange master franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the subfranchisees under their franchise agreements and typically pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate our largest master franchisee yum china pays the company a continuing fee of 3 on system sales of our concepts in mainland china 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units can feature dinein carryout drivethru and delivery services nontraditional 

units include express units and kiosks that have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carryout food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut typically offers delivery service while on a more limited but expanding basis kfc and taco bell allow for consumers to have the concepts food delivered either through storelevel or thirdparty delivery services on february 7 2018 certain of our subsidiaries entered into a master services agreement with an affiliate of grubhub inc grubhub an online and mobile takeout foodordering company in the us which is intended to provide dedicated support for the kfc and taco bell branded online delivery channels in the us through grubhub’s online ordering platform logistics and lastmile support for delivery orders as well as pointofsale integration to streamline operations 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches where sufficient scale allows area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants 

supply and distribution 

the company and franchisees of the concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically the company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available 

in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane foodservice inc is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee stores 

outside the us we and our concepts franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors we and our franchisees have approximately 6300 food and paper suppliers including usbased suppliers that export to many countries 

advertising and promotional programs 

companyowned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants’ sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the concepts advertising may be conducted nationally regionally and locally when multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and companyowned stores if any contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants’ sales the contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising market research commercial production talent payments and other support functions for the respective concepts we control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives through our majority voting rights 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks 

the use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business 

working capital 

information about the company’s working capital is included in mda in part ii item 7 and the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

seasonal operations 

the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree 

competition 

the retail food industry in which our concepts compete is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including those in the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of our concepts competes with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2018  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated 

government regulation 

us operations   the company and its us operations as well as our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting its business including laws and regulations concerning information security labor and employment health marketing food labeling sanitation and safety each of our and our concepts’ franchisees restaurants in the us must comply with licensing requirements and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental authorities which include health sanitation safety fire and zoning agencies in the state andor municipality in which the restaurant is located in addition each concept must comply with various state and federal laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship to date the company has not been materially adversely affected by such licensing requirements and regulations or by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

international operations  our and our concepts franchisees restaurants outside the us are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting us restaurants the restaurants outside the us are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment as well as antibribery and anticorruption laws 

see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of risks relating to federal state local and international regulation of our business 

employees

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli listeria salmonella and trichinosis occur or may occur within our system from time to time in addition food safety issues such as food tampering contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts’ restaurants including restaurants operated by us or our concepts’ franchisees or linking our competitors or the retail food industry generally to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation and damages if a customer of one of our concepts becomes ill from food borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales or the sales of our concepts’ franchisees the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic including various strains of avian flu or swine flu such as h1n1 the occurrence of such an outbreak of an epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments could materially disrupt our business and operations such events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary closure of restaurants which could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu or other illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world and such outbreaks have resulted in confirmed human cases it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products because poultry is a menu offering for our concepts this would likely result in lower revenues and profits for us and our concepts’ franchisees avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact profit margins and revenues for us and our concepts franchisees 

furthermore other viruses may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures impose restrictions on operations of restaurants or restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our operating results and growth strategies are closely and increasingly tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are operated by our concepts’ franchisees at the end of 2018 over 98 of our stores are operated by franchisees our refranchising efforts have increased our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our concepts’ franchisees in addition our longterm system sales growth targets depend on an acceleration of our historical net system unit growth rate nearly all of this unit growth is expected to result from new unit openings by our concepts’ franchisees if our concepts’ franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development we may fall short of our system sales targets 

we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments if our concepts’ franchisees fail to adequately capitalize their businesses or incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in their financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee of one of our concepts becomes or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees in the aggregate become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments and reduced new unit development in addition we are secondarily liable on certain of our concepts’ franchisees’ lease agreements including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with the refranchising of certain companyowned restaurants our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties to the extent our concepts’ franchisees default on such lease agreements 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our concepts’ franchisees to implement major initiatives such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades which may require financial investment our concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the company additionally the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations such as quality service and cleanliness even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents could have a negative impact on our business 

we may not achieve our target development goals aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to increase net restaurant count in markets around the world the successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees including yum china will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and trade or economic sanctions and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified management teams and restaurant crews and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ willingness to invest capital or ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants or if the perceived return on invested capital is not sufficiently attractive the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the development of new restaurants could impact the sales of our concepts’ existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

we may not successfully implement our transformation initiatives or fully realize the anticipated benefits from the transformation 

we are in the process of implementing our previously announced strategic transformation plans to drive global expansion of our kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands following our becoming 98 franchised as of the end of 2018 the remaining components of this transformation include among other things a plan to significantly reduce annual capital expenditures and our general and administrative costs by the end of 2019 we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our transformation initiatives further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of this transformation including the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency within expected timeframes is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are in turn subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control there is no assurance that we will successfully implement or fully realize the anticipated positive impact of our transformation initiatives or execute successfully on our transformation strategy in the expected timeframes or at all in addition there can be no assurance that our efforts if properly executed will result in our desired outcome of improved financial performance 

we have significant exposure to the chinese market through our largest franchisee yum china which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

in connection with the spinoff of our china business in 2016 we entered into a master license agreement with yum china pursuant to which yum china is the exclusive licensee of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in china following the separation yum china became and continues to be our largest franchisee as a result our overall financial results are significantly affected by yum china’s results yum chinas business is exposed to risks in china which include among others changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences the regulatory environment and tax laws and regulations including the tax treatment of the royalty paid to yum as well as increased media scrutiny of our concepts and industry fluctuations in foreign exchange rates increased restrictions or tariffs on imported supplies as a result of trade disputes and increased competition further any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our concepts in china if chinese consumers reduce the frequency of their visits to yum china’s restaurants chinese law regulates yum chinas business conducted within china our royalty income from the yum china business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on the policies of the chinese government as they may change from time to time if yum china’s business is harmed or development of our concepts’ restaurants is slowed in china due to any of these factors it could negatively impact the royalty paid by yum china to us which would negatively impact our financial results or our growth prospects 

our relationship with yum china is governed primarily by a master license agreement which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of yum china in addition if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china if yum china is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the master license agreement or if the master license agreement is otherwise terminated it could result in an interruption in the operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to yum china for use in china such interruption could cause a delay in or loss of royalty income to us which would negatively impact our financial results 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us including in emerging markets and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business and the businesses of our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest as well as changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws sanctions foreign exchange control regimes including restrictions on currency conversion consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our concepts restaurants are operated in addition we and our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages the imposition of penalties suspension of business licenses or a cessation of operations at our or our franchisees’ businesses as well as damage to our and our concepts’ brands’ images and reputations all of which could harm our profitability 

foreign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results 

our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi “rmb” australian dollar the british pound and the euro as well as currencies in certain other markets such as the malaysian ringgit and russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance 

as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition the governments in certain countries where we operate including china restrict the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of the country yum china’s income is almost exclusively derived from the earnings of its chinese subsidiaries with substantially all revenues of its chinese subsidiaries denominated in rmb any significant fluctuation in the value of the rmb could materially impact the us dollar value of royalty payments made to us by yum china which could result in lower revenues in addition restrictions on the conversion of rmb to us dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of china could result in delays in the remittance of yum china’s license fee which could impact our liquidity 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees and franchisees in addition our vendors andor franchisees receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our employees and customers the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or if our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees do business for example the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition in june 2018 the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which will become effective in 2020 requiring companies that process information on california residents to among other things make new disclosures to consumers about data collection use and sharing practices our failure to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr ccpa and other evolving laws and regulations in this area could result in financial penalties legal liability and could damage our and our concepts’ brands’ reputations 

unreliable or inefficient restaurant or consumer interfacing technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives in the future could adversely impact operating results 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely heavily on information technology systems in the conduct of our business some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including for example pointofsale processing in our restaurants management of our supply chain and various other processes and procedures these systems are subject to damage interruption or failure due to theft fire power outages telecommunications failure computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks or other catastrophic events certain technology systems may also be unreliable or inefficient and technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance which could impact the reliability of critical systems operations if our or our concepts franchisees information technology systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales customer or employee dissatisfaction or negative publicity that could negatively impact our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we and our concepts’ franchisees rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience sales growth and margin improvement execution of our growth strategy will be dependent on our initiatives to implement technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience our strategic technology initiatives may not be timely implemented or may not achieve the desired results even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives they may not result in sales growth or margin improvement additionally implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us and our concepts’ franchisees 

there are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms to maintain and grow sales such platforms may experience disruptions which could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business 

customers are increasingly using ecommerce websites and apps both domestically and internationally like pizzahutcom pizza hut kfc and taco bell apps as well as apps owned by thirdparty delivery aggregators such as grubhub and thirdparty mobile payment processors to order and pay for our concepts’ products as a result our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel these digital ordering and payment platforms could be damaged or interrupted by power loss technological failures user errors cyberattacks other forms of sabotage or acts of god in particular pizza hut relies on digital orders for a significant portion of its sales and could experience interruptions of its digital ordering platforms which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms any such limitation or delay would negatively impact pizza hut’s sales and customer experience and perception in addition if pizza hut’s digital ordering platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security speed attractiveness or ease of use customers may be less inclined to return to such digital ordering platforms which could negatively impact our sales results of operations and financial condition 

yum china our largest franchisee utilizes thirdparty mobile payment apps such as alipay and wechat as a means through which to generate sales and process payments should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in china or should the relationship between yum china and one or more thirdparty mobile payment processors become interrupted our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

in addition social media is frequently used by our concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general failure by our concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately particularly as compared to our concepts’ respective competitors could lead to a decline in brand value customer visits and revenue other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts’ brands exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we along with our concepts’ franchisees are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our concepts’ restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants in february 2018 we and our franchisees transitioned to a new distributor for the products supplied to our approximately 900 kfcs in the united kingdom and ireland in connection with this transition certain of the restaurants experienced supply availability issues which resulted in store closures or stores operating under a limited menu for a period of time future similar shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters inaccurate forecasting of customer demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports including due to trade disputes the inability of vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which the suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards or requirements product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements product recalls the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms or other conditions beyond our control or the control of our concepts’ franchisees the pending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union particularly if such withdrawal occurs without a transition agreement in effect may result in the reimposition of customs and border controls which in turn may result in shortages or interruptions in supply to our concepts in the united kingdom with 

consequences similar to those described above in the us the company along with representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment any failure or inability of rscs to perform its purchasing obligations could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies 

a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a key supplier or distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new supplier or distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth harm our business and reduce our profitability 

restaurant operations are highly serviceoriented and our success depends in part upon our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees including franchisee management restaurant managers and other crew members the market for qualified employees in the retail food industry is very competitive any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees and could adversely impact operation of our concepts’ existing restaurants any such delays material increases in employee turnover rate in franchisee management or existing restaurants or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ business and results of operations 

in addition strikes work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common in the event of a strike work slowdown or other labor unrest the ability to adequately staff our concepts’ restaurants could be impaired which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities 

changes in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

an increase in the costs of employee wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results such increases could result from government imposition of higher minimum wages or from general economic or competitive conditions any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins in addition competition for qualified employees could also compel us or our concepts’ franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain key crew members which could result in higher labor costs and decreased profitability 

a broader standard for determining joint employer status may adversely affect our business operations and increase our liabilities 

the national labor relations board the “nlrb” in 2014 adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act if this joint employer liability standard is upheld or adopted by other government agencies andor applied generally to franchise relationships under other laws like the us fair labor standards act it could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and could subject our concepts to other liabilities andor require our concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our concepts’ franchisees in such event our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability 

an increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins 

our and our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins including poultry pork beef and seafood cheese oil flour and vegetables including potatoes and lettuce raw materials purchased for use in our concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather conditions or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials or taxes and tariffs including as a result of trade disputes as a result the historical prices of raw materials used in the operation of our concepts’ restaurants have fluctuated we cannot assure you that we or our concepts’ franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices or that the cost of raw materials will remain stable in the future in addition a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors 

because we and our concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases if we and our concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost 

of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately our and our franchisees’ profit margins may be adversely impacted 

our concepts’ brands may be harmed or diluted through franchisee and thirdparty activity 

although we monitor and regulate franchisee activities through our concepts’ franchise agreements franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our concepts’ brands or place our concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation this may result in dilution of or harm to our intellectual property or the value of our concepts’ brands 

franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our concepts’ brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices moreover unauthorized third parties including our concepts’ current and former franchisees may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our concepts’ brands resulting in consumer confusion or brand dilution any reduction of our concepts’ brands’ goodwill consumer confusion or brand dilution is likely to impact sales and could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ loyalty to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us franchisees competitors governments suppliers or distributors can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our concepts’ brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers distributors or franchisees regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true similarly entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct including alleged human rights abuses or environmental wrongdoing and any such conduct could damage our or our concepts’ brands’ reputations any such incidents even if resulting from actions of a competitor or franchisee could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts’ brands andor our products and reduce consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits additionally our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or an employee or representative of us or a franchisee 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include consumer employment real estate related tort intellectual property breach of contract securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any such claims have merit or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources and management attention away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our concepts’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the restaurant industry around the world has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse effects these concerns could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products we may also be subject to such claims in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

 

compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our or our concepts’ franchisees’ operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial results or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses internal investigations governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues 

failure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business operations 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing emphasis and enforcement around the world there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines and significant investigation costs and could also materially damage our reputation brands international expansion efforts and growth prospects business and operating results publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

tax matters including changes in tax rates or laws disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to ongoing andor regular reviews examinations and audits by the us internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience interpretations of applicable law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities but such accruals require significant judgment which may be incorrect and may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties payment of additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax laws and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in laws regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition changes in tax laws may arise as a result of guidance issued by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” a coalition of member nations including the united states the oecd guidance referred to as the base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plan does not have the force of law but certain countries may enact tax legislation modify tax treaties andor increase audit scrutiny based on the beps guidance to the extent beps principles are adopted by major jurisdictions in which we operate it could increase our taxes and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition public perception that we are not paying a sufficient amount of taxes could damage our concepts’ reputations which could harm our profitability 

the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

we received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions qualified as generally taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code the opinions relied on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings including with respect to future conduct made by yum china and us if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the irs because the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge 

if notwithstanding receipt of any opinion the irs were to conclude that the yum china spinoff was taxable in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the yum china common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition each us holder of our common stock who received shares of yum china common stock in connection with the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of yum china common stock received that distribution would be taxable to each such us stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such us stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

the yum china spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

in february 2015 the chinese state administration of taxation “sat” issued the bulletin on several issues of enterprise income tax on income arising from indirect transfers of property by nonresident enterprises “bulletin 7” pursuant to bulletin 7 an “indirect transfer” of chinese taxable assets including equity interests in a china resident enterprise “chinese interests” by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of chinese taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of chinese enterprise income tax using general antitax avoidance provisions the sat may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of chinese interests if the transfer has avoided chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to chinese enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of up to 10 of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a china resident enterprise 

we evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 in connection with the separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose 

however there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10 assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of yum china as our tax basis in yum china was minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our yum® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of 

protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the us and foreign jurisdictions however from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or may in the future open or franchise a restaurant there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources we may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with the use of the proprietary knowhow concepts recipes or trade secrets used in our business defending against such claims may be costly and we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages royalties or other fees for using such proprietary information any of which could negatively affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions 

purchases at our concepts’ restaurants are discretionary for consumers and therefore our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions our and our franchisees results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment rates fluctuations in the level of disposable income the price of gasoline stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

the retail food industry in which our concepts operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if our concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our and our franchisees businesses could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas and is expected to continue to increase increased competition could have an adverse effect on sales profitability or development plans which could harm our or our franchisees’ financial condition and operating results 

our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain 

as of december 31 2018 our total outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt was approximately 10 billion subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt from time to time which would increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness 

specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 



 

there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

from 2017 through 2019 we intend to return an additional 65  70 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends we intend to fund these shareholder returns through a combination of refranchising proceeds free cash flow generation 

and maintenance of our five times ebitda leverage we generated pretax proceeds of 28 billion through our refranchising initiatives to achieve targeted franchise ownership of 98 which were completed in december 2018 refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda for additional details 

beginning in 2017 we changed our fiscal year from a year ending on the last saturday of december to a year beginning on january 1 and ending on december 31 of each year concurrently we removed the reporting lags from the fiscal calendars of our international subsidiaries our mda has been recast to reflect the change in our reporting calendar see notes 2 and 5 for additional details related to our fiscal calendar 

  

we intend for this mda to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations including performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following performance metrics 

 

 

 

in addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the company provides the following nongaap measurements 

 

 

 

 

these nongaap measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of these nongaap measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

special items are not included in any of our division segment results as the company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of special items when assessing segment performance 

certain nongaap measurements are presented excluding the impact of fx these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates we believe the elimination of the fx impact provides better yeartoyear comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 

for 2016 we provided core operating profit excluding 53rd week and system sales excluding 53rd week to further enhance the comparability with the lapping of the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2016

items impacting reported results andor expected to impact future results 

strategic transformation initiatives impact 

we have refranchised a significant number of companyowned restaurants since the announcement of yum’s strategic transformation initiatives in october 2016 the impact on operating profit due to refranchising includes the loss of restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and the increase in franchise and property revenues from restaurants that have been refranchised we have made ga reductions including reductions directly attributable to refranchising such that beginning in 2019 on an annual basis the impact of lost operating profit from our refranchising initiatives will be largely offset by ga reductions we have made operating profit was negatively impacted throughout 2018 as certain ga reductions lagged the loss of operating profit due to refranchising the impact of refranchising net of ga reductions negatively impacted core operating profit growth for 2018 by 4 percentage points 

kfc united kingdom uk supply availability issues 

on february 14 2018 we and our franchisees transitioned to a new distributor for the products supplied to our approximately 900 kfcs in the united kingdom and ireland those restaurants accounted for approximately 3 of yum’s global system sales in the year ended december 31 2018 in connection with this transition certain of the restaurants experienced supply availability issues which resulted in store closures or stores operating under a limited menu beginning midmay 2018 all restaurants opened for business offering their full menus with advertising beginning at the end of may on a fullyear basis core operating profit growth was negatively impacted by approximately 2 percentage points for kfc division and approximately 1 percentage point for yum as a result of these firsthalf supply availability issues the negative impact to fullyear samestore sales growth for 2018 was approximately 50 basis points for our kfc division and approximately 25 basis points for yum 

investment in grubhub 

for the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized pretax income of 14 million related to our investment in grubhub see note 5 for further discussion of our investment in grubhub 

telepizza strategic alliance 

on december 30 2018 the company consummated a strategic alliance with telepizza group sa “telepizza” the largest non usbased pizza delivery company in the world to be the master franchisee of pizza hut in latin america and portions of europe the key terms of the alliance are set forth below 

 

as a result of the alliance we added 1282 telepizza units to our pizza hut division unit count at december 31 2018 in total approximately 2300 pizza hut and telepizza units are subject to the master franchise agreement as of december 31 2018 of these 2300 units we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap in a particular trade area 

based upon our ongoing and active maintenance of the pizza hut intellectual property as well as telepizza’s active involvement in supply chain management and their role as a master franchisee both parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the alliance as a result the alliance has been identified as a collaborative arrangement and upon consummation of the alliance no amounts were recorded in our consolidated financial statements other than insignificant success fees that were paid to thirdparty advisors subsequent to consummation of the deal for all pizza hut restaurants that are part of the alliance we will receive a continuing fee of 35 of restaurant sales likewise for most telepizza restaurants that are part of the alliance we will receive an alliance fee of 35 of restaurant sales these fees will be recorded as franchise and property revenues within our consolidated statement of income when the related sales occur consistent with our recognition of continuing fees for all other restaurants subject to our franchise agreements these fees will be reduced by a salesbased credit that decreases over time and potentially certain incentive payments if development or conversion targets are met previously the existing pizza hut restaurants that are now subject to the master franchise agreement with telepizza generally paid a continuing fee of 6 of restaurant sales consistent with our standard international franchise agreement terms 

adoption of topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers 

the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued standards to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries “topic 606” as a result the company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed in note 2 we adopted topic 606 on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method therefore the comparative information for fiscal 2017 and 2016 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under our accounting polices related to revenue recognition prior to the adoption of topic 606 legacy gaap gaap operating profit for the year ended december 31 2018 was 14 million lower and core operating profit was 41 million lower 2 percentage points than what would have been recognized under legacy gaap 



 

topic 606 also impacted transactions that were not historically included in our revenues and expenses such as franchisee contributions to and subsequent expenditures from advertising cooperatives that we are required to consolidate as well as receipts and expenditures for other services we provide to our franchisees based on legacy gaap these transactions were reported on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income this change did not have a significant impact on operating profit as the contributions that are now recorded in franchise contributions for advertising and other services are largely offset by the expenditures recorded in franchise advertising and other services expense refer to notes 2 and 5 for further details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of topic 606 

  

income tax matters 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 see note 17 for discussion of the charge recorded as a result of the enactment the tax act significantly modified the us corporate income tax system by among other things reducing the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 limiting certain deductions including limiting the deductibility of interest expense to 30 of us earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda imposing a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and creating a territorial tax system that changes the manner in which foreign earnings are now subject to us tax 

after considering the impacts of the tax act we anticipate a 2019 and ongoing effective tax rate of 20 to 22 compared to our pre2018 annual guidance of 26 to 27 as we expect to benefit from the lower us tax rate and the territorial tax system due to a majority of our earnings being generated outside the us we anticipate this benefit will be partially offset by taxes incurred under the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions of the tax act we originally anticipated that our 2018 effective tax would be slightly below the ongoing anticipated range of 20 to 22 primarily due to a delay in the applicability of the gilti provisions of the tax act our actual 2018 effective tax rate excluding special items of 204 was higher than we originally expected this was due to the negative impact of a reserve of approximately 20 million we recorded related to a dispute concerning the income tax rate to be applied to our 2018 income in a foreign market

in 2017 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1030 million compared to 1248 million in 2016 the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in interest payments and retirement and deferred compensation payouts to retirees partially offset by an increase in operating profit before special items 

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 313 million in 2018 compared to 1472 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds and our 200 million investment in grubhub common stock in 2018

the refranchising of companyoperated stores drove decreases in restaurantlevel assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including within property plant and equipment ppe 

liquidity and capital resources 

in october 2016 we announced yum’s strategic transformation initiatives to drive global expansion of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands following the separation on october 31 2016 as part of this transformation we announced our intention to own less than 1000 stores by the end of 2018 as of december 31 2018 we owned 856 stores additionally we announced our intention to by 2019 reduce annual recurring capital expenditures to approximately 100 million improve our efficiency by lowering ga to 17 of system sales and increase free cash flow conversion to 100 

in 2018 and 2017 we returned a cumulative 52 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends towards our commitment to return between 65 and 70 billion from 2017 to 2019 we are funding these shareholder returns through a combination of refranchising proceeds free cash flow generation and maintenance of our five times ebitda leverage we generated total gross refranchising proceeds of 28 billion in connection with our initiative to increase franchise ownership to 98 which we achieved in december 2018 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated by operations and our revolving facilities as of december 31 2018 we had cash and cash equivalents of 292 million cash and cash equivalents decreased from 1522 million at december 31 2017 due to share repurchases dividend payments the repayment of 325 million in yum senior unsecured notes that matured in march 2018 and our investment in grubhub we have historically generated substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment our annual operating cash flows from continuing operations have historically been in excess of 1 billion decreases in operating cash flows from the operation of fewer companyowned stores due to refranchising have been offset and are expected to continue to be offset with savings generated from decreased capital investment and ga required to support company operations to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds do not cover our anticipated cash needs we maintain a revolving credit facility with total capacity of 1 billion that was undrawn as of year end 2018 

o ur balance sheet often reflects a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and is also historically common for yum our royalty receivables from franchisees are generally due within 30 days of the period in which the related sales occur 

and company sales are paid in cash or by credit card which is quickly converted into cash substantial amounts of cash received have historically been either returned to shareholders or invested in new restaurant assets which are noncurrent in nature as part of our working capital strategy we negotiate favorable credit terms with vendors and as a result our onhand inventory turns faster than the related shortterm liabilities accordingly it is not unusual for current liabilities to exceed current assets we believe such a deficit has no significant impact on our liquidity or operations 

debt instruments 

as of december 31 2018 approximately 91 including the impact of interest rate swaps of our 101 billion of total debt outstanding is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 47 we are managing a capital structure which is levered inline with our target of approximately five times ebitda and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years we have credit ratings of bb standard  poorsba3 moodys with a balance sheet consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies 

securitization notes in may 2016 taco bell funding llc a newly formed special purpose subsidiary of the company issued an aggregate of 23 billion of fixed rate senior secured notes the “2016 class a2 notes” on november 14 2018 taco bell funding llc completed a refinancing agreement and issued two fixed rate senior secured notes in the aggregate amount of 145 billion the 2018 class a2 notes and together with the 2016 class a2 notes the securitization notes proceeds from the 2018 issuance were used to repay 788 million of existing securitization notes issued in 2016 and to repay the then outstanding balance on the revolving facility see below the securitization notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the failure to pay principal on any outstanding securitization notes will constitute an event of default under any other securitization notes 

credit agreement on june 16 2016 three whollyowned subsidiaries of the company kfc holding co pizza hut holdings llc and taco bell of america llc as coborrowers the borrowers entered into a new credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for the following each of which may be increased subject to certain conditions i a 500 million term loan a facility the “term loan a facility” ii a 2 billion term loan b facility the “term loan b facility” and iii a 1 billion revolving facility the “revolving facility” which has no outstanding borrowings and has 7 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2018 each of which may be increased subject to certain conditions our term loan a facility and term loan b facility contain crossdefault provisions whereby the failure to pay principal of or otherwise perform any agreement or condition under indebtedness of certain subsidiaries with a principal amount in excess of 100 million will constitute an event of default under the credit agreement

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2018 included 



 

 

 

 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from timetotime to improve the plan’s funded status at december 31 2018 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 42 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 86 million at our 2018 measurement date 

we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2019 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2019 and beyond 

our postretirement health care plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 6 million in 2018 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table 117 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

see the lease guarantees and franchise loan pool and equipment guarantees sections of note 19 for discussion of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued standards on the recognition and measurement of leases that are intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring that substantially all lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and by requiring the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements we will adopt these standards using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the first quarter of 2019 and will not recast the comparative periods presented in the financial statements upon adoption see recent accounting pronouncements in note 2 for additional information regarding our adoption of the new lease accounting standards 

in june 2016 the fasb issued a standard that requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held the standard is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we writedown the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from franchise royalties and companyowned restaurant operations if any 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth from net new restaurants or samesales growth and margin improvement for those reporting units which include companyowned restaurant operations assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2018 goodwill testing date 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2018 refranchising activity completed by the company resulted in the writeoff of 12 million in goodwill within refranchising gain loss representing 2 of beginningofyear company goodwill of the 12 million the most significant writeoffs were recognized within our kfc uk taco bell us and kfc russia reporting units within kfc uk 91 restaurants were refranchised representing 65 of beginningofyear company units and 5 million in goodwill was written off representing 

13 of beginningofyear goodwill within taco bell us 199 restaurants were refranchised representing 31 of beginningofyear company units and 4 million in goodwill was written off representing 4 of beginningofyear goodwill within kfc russia 194 restaurants were refranchised representing 91 of beginningofyear company units and 2 million in goodwill was written off representing 11 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 873 million and a fair value of plan assets of 755 million at december 31 2018 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 46 at december 31 2018  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or standard  poors sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 50 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 60 million at our measurement date 

the net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2019 is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect net periodic benefit cost plus expected pension settlement charges for our us plans to decrease approximately 13 million in 2019  a 50 basispoint decrease or increase in our discount rate assumption at our 2018 measurement date would not significantly impact our 2019 us net periodic benefit cost the impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are reflected primarily in other pension income expense 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical and expected future returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2019 pension expense at december 31 2018 was 575 net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2019 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 8 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 575 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 8 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 101 million included in aoci for these us plans at december 31 2018  we will recognize approximately 1 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2019 versus 16 million recognized in 2018 see note 14 

income taxes 

at december 31 2018 we had valuation allowances of approximately 454 million to reduce our 748 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2018 we had 113 million of unrecognized tax benefits 10 million of which are temporary in nature and if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act included a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been provided have now been subject to us tax our cash currently held overseas is primarily limited to that necessary to fund working capital requirements thus we have not provided taxes on our foreign unremitted earnings including us state income and foreign withholding taxes as we believe they are indefinitely reinvested see note 17 for a further discussion of our income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and the value of our equity investment in grubhub in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us our outstanding total debt of 101 billion includes 76 fixedrate debt and 24 variablerate debt we have attempted to minimize the interest rate risk from variablerate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that as of december 31 2018 result in a fixed interest rate on 155 billion of our variable rate debt as a result approximately 91 of our 101 billion of outstanding debt at december 31 2018 is effectively fixedrate debt see note 10 for details on these issuances and repayments and note 12 for details related to interest rate swaps 

as of both december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swaps in an increase of approximately 9 million in interest expense net within our consolidated statements of income these estimated amounts are based upon the current level of variablerate debt that has not been swapped to fixed and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and exclude any impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 

the fair value of our cumulative fixedrate debt of 77 billion as of december 31 2018 would decrease approximately 400 million as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase at december 31 2018 a hypothetical 100 basispoint decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swaps approximately 100 million fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the durations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 16 billion as of december 31 2018  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 operating profit would have decreased approximately 135 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors 

equity investment risk 

yum holds 2820464 shares of grubhub common stock see note 5 as of december 31 2018 the nyse composite closing sales price of grubhub was 7681 a hypothetical 10 decline in the price of these shares would result in a 21 million decrease in the fair value of these investments which would be reflected as a charge in investment income expense net within our consolidated statements of income the effects of changes in market prices for equity securities are unpredictable which could cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results

narrative description of business 

general 

yum has over 45000 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories the companys three concepts of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the “concepts” develop operate or franchise a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by the concepts or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements which typically require an initial nonrefundable fee upon an individual store opening and the payment of salesbased fees for use of our concepts brands the terms franchise or franchisee within this form 10k are meant to describe third parties that operate units under either franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut typically offers delivery service while on a more limited but expanding basis kfc and taco bell allow for consumers to have the concepts food delivered either through storelevel or thirdparty delivery services in february 2018 we entered into an agreement with grubhub inc grubhub the leading online and mobile take out foodordering company in the us under the agreement grubhub will provide support in the us for the kfc and taco bell branded online delivery channels along with access to grubhubs online ordering platform logistics and lastmile support for delivery orders and pointofsale integration to streamline operations 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and convenient food at competitive prices 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises the company utilizes both storelevel franchise and master franchise programs to grow its businesses under storelevel franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business in certain refranchising transactions the company may retain ownership of land and building and lease them to the franchisee franchisees contribute to the company’s revenues by paying nonrefundable upfront fees at inception of the franchise agreement and on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales usually 4  6 under master franchise arrangements the company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as subfranchise within certain geographic territories master franchisees are responsible for overseeing development within their territories and collect initial fees and royalties from subfranchisees master franchisees generally pay upfront fees and ongoing royalties at a reduced rate to the company our largest master franchisee yum china pays a 3 license fee on system sales of our concepts in mainland china to the company 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

following is a brief description of each concept

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units can feature dinein carryout drivethru and delivery services nontraditional units include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches where sufficient scale allows area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli trichinosis listeria and salmonella occur or may occur within our system from time to time in addition food safety issues such as food tampering contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts’ restaurants including restaurants operated by us or our concepts’ franchisees or linking our competitors or our industry generally to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation and damages if a customer of one of our concepts becomes ill as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales or the sales of our concepts’ franchisees the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic including various strains of avian flu or swine flu such as h1n1 the occurrence of such an outbreak of an epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments could materially disrupt our business and operations such events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary closure of restaurants which would severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu or other illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world and such outbreaks have resulted in confirmed human cases it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products because poultry is a menu offering for our concepts this would likely result in lower revenues and profits for us and our concepts’ franchisees avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues 

furthermore other viruses may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our operating results and growth strategies are closely and increasingly tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are operated by our concepts’ franchisees in 2016 we announced our plan to become at least 98 franchised by the end of 2018 our refranchising efforts have increased and will continue to increase our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our concepts’ franchisees in addition our longterm system sales growth targets depend on an acceleration of our historical net system unit growth rate nearly all of this unit growth is expected to result from new unit openings by our concepts’ franchisees if our concepts’ franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development we may fall short of our system sales growth targets 

we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments if our concepts’ franchisees incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in their financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee of one of our concepts becomes or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees in the aggregate become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments and reduced new unit development in addition we are contingently liable on certain of our concepts’ franchisees’ lease agreements including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with the refranchising of certain companyowned restaurants our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties to the extent our concepts’ franchisees default on such lease agreements 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our concepts’ franchisees to implement major initiatives such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades which may require financial investment our concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the company additionally the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations such as quality service and cleanliness even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents could have a negative impact on our business 

we may not successfully implement our transformation initiatives or fully realize the anticipated benefits from the transformation 

we are in the process of implementing our strategic transformation plans to drive global expansion of our kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands among other things this transformation includes a plan to become at least 98 franchised by the end of 2018 and to significantly reduce annual capital expenditures and our general and administrative costs each by the end of 2019 we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our transformation initiatives further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of this transformation including the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency within expected timeframes is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are in turn subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control there is no assurance that we will successfully implement or fully 

realize the anticipated positive impact of our transformation initiatives or execute successfully on our transformation strategy in the expected timeframes or at all in addition there can be no assurance that our efforts if properly executed will result in our desired outcome of improved financial performance 

we have significant exposure to the chinese market through our largest franchisee yum china which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

in connection with the separation we entered into a master license agreement with yum china pursuant to which yum china is the exclusive licensee of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in china following the separation yum china became and continues to be our largest franchisee as a result our overall financial results are significantly affected by yum china’s results yum chinas business is exposed to risks in china which include among others changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences and the regulatory environment as well as increased media scrutiny of our concepts and industry fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and increased competition further any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our concepts in china if chinese consumers reduce the frequency of their visits to yum china’s restaurants chinese law regulates yum chinas business conducted within china our royalty income from the yum china business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on the policies of the chinese government as they may change from time to time 

our relationship with yum china is governed by a master license agreement which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of yum china in addition if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china if yum china is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the master license agreement or if the master license agreement is otherwise terminated it could result in an interruption in the operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to yum china for use in china such interruption could cause a delay in or loss of royalty income to us which would negatively impact our financial results 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us including in emerging markets and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest as well as changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws sanctions foreign exchange control regimes consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated in addition our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages the imposition of penalties suspension of business licenses or a cessation of operations at our franchisees’ businesses as well as damage to our and our concepts’ brands’ images and reputations all of which could harm our profitability 

foreign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results 

our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi “rmb” australian dollar the british pound and the euro as well as currencies in certain other markets such as the malaysian ringgit and russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition the chinese government restricts the convertibility of rmb into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of china yum china’s income is almost exclusively derived from the earnings of its chinese subsidiaries with substantially all revenues of its chinese subsidiaries denominated in rmb any significant fluctuation in the value of the rmb could materially impact the us dollar value of royalty payments made to us by yum china which could result in lower revenues in addition restrictions on the conversion of rmb to us dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of china could result in delays in the remittance of yum china’s license fee which could impact our liquidity 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees and franchisees in addition our vendors andor franchisees receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our employees 

and customers the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or if our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees do business for example the european union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data our failure to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area could result in financial penalties legal liability and could damage our and our concepts’ brands’ reputations 

there are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms to maintain and grow sales in addition aspects of our information technology systems may experience disruptions which could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business 

customers are increasingly using ecommerce websites and apps both domestically and internationally like pizzahutcom pizza hut kfc and taco bell apps as well as apps owned by thirdparty delivery aggregators such as grubhub and thirdparty mobile payment processors to order and pay for our concepts’ products as a result our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel these digital ordering and payment platforms could be damaged or interrupted by power loss technological failures user errors cyberattacks other forms of sabotage or acts of god in particular pizza hut relies on digital orders for a significant portion of its sales and could experience interruptions of its digital ordering platforms which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms any such limitation or delay would negatively impact pizza hut’s sales and customer experience and perception in addition if pizza hut’s digital ordering platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security speed attractiveness or ease of use customers may be less inclined to return to such digital ordering platforms which could negatively impact our sales results of operations and financial condition 

in addition yum china our largest franchisee relies heavily on thirdparty mobile payment apps such as alipay and wechat as a means through which to generate sales and process payments should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in china or should the relationship between yum china and one or more thirdparty mobile payment processors become interrupted our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information via social media could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

in addition social media is frequently used by our concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general failure by our concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately particularly as compared to our concepts’ respective competitors could lead to a decline in brand value customer visits and revenue other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts’ brands exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we along with our concepts’ franchisees are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our concepts’ restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters inaccurate forecasting of customer demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports the inability of vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms or other conditions beyond our control or the control of our concepts’ franchisees in the us the company along with representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment any failure or inability of rscs to perform its purchasing obligations could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies 

a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a key supplier or distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new supplier or distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may not achieve our target development goals aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets around the world especially in emerging markets the successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees including yum china will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and trade or economic sanctions and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified restaurant crews and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the development of new restaurants could impact the sales of our concepts’ existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth harm our business and reduce our profitability 

restaurant operations are highly serviceoriented and our success depends in part upon our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees including restaurant managers and other crew members the market for qualified employees in our industry is very competitive any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees and could adversely impact operation of our concepts’ existing restaurants any such delays material increases in employee turnover rate in existing restaurants or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ business and results of operations 

in addition strikes work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common in the event of a strike work slowdown or other labor unrest the ability to adequately staff our concepts’ restaurants could be impaired which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities 

changes in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

an increase in the costs of employee wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results such increases could result from government imposition of higher minimum wages or from general economic or competitive conditions any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins in addition competition for qualified employees could also compel us or our concepts’ franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain key crew members which could result in higher labor costs and decreased profitability 

the standard for determining joint employer status could adversely affect our business operations and increase our liabilities resulting from actions by our concepts’ franchisees 

the national labor relations board’s the “nlrb” standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act is uncertain and subject to change in addition the general counsel’s office of the nlrb has issued complaints naming mcdonald’s corporation as a joint employer of workers at its franchisees for alleged violations of the us fair labor standards act the nlrb’s joint employer liability standard could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices violations of wage and hour laws and other violations and could also require our concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of our concepts’ franchisees further there is no assurance that we or our concepts will not receive similar complaints as mcdonald’s corporation in the future which could result in legal proceedings based on the actions of our concepts’ franchisees in such events our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability 

an increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins 

our and our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins including poultry pork beef and seafood cheese oil flour and vegetables including potatoes and lettuce raw materials purchased for use in our concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather conditions or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials as a result the historical prices of raw materials used in the operation of our concepts’ restaurants have fluctuated we cannot assure you that we or our concepts’ franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices or that the cost of raw materials will remain stable in the future in addition a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors 

because we and our concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases if we and our concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately our and our franchisees’ profit margins may be adversely impacted 

our concepts’ brands may be limited or diluted through franchisee and thirdparty activity 

although we monitor and regulate franchisee activities through our concepts’ franchise agreements franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our concepts’ brands or place our concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation this may result in dilution of or harm to our intellectual property or the value of our concepts’ brands 

franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our concepts’ brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices moreover unauthorized third parties including our concepts’ current and former franchisees may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our concepts’ brands resulting in consumer confusion or dilution any reduction of our concepts’ brands’ goodwill consumer confusion or dilution is likely to impact sales and could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ loyalty to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective 

qualities business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us franchisees competitors suppliers or distributors can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our concepts’ brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers distributors or franchisees regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true similarly entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct including alleged human rights abuses or environmental wrongdoing and any such conduct could damage our or our concepts’ brands’ reputations any such incidents even if resulting from actions of a competitor or franchisee could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts’ brands andor our products and reduce consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits additionally our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or an employee or representative of us or a franchisee 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include consumer employment real estate related tort intellectual property breach of contract securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any such claims have merit or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources and management attention away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the restaurant industry around the world has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse effects these concerns could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products we may also be subject to such claims in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 



compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our or our concepts’ franchisees’ operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial results or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses internal investigations governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues 

failure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business operations 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing emphasis and enforcement around the world although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines and significant investigation costs and could also materially damage our reputation brands international expansion efforts and growth prospects business and operating results publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

tax matters including changes in tax rates or laws disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to ongoing andor regular reviews examinations and audits by the us internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us in connection with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting project companies are now required to disclose more information to tax authorities on their global operations which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience interpretations of applicable law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities but because such accruals require significant judgment the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties payment of additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax laws and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in laws regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” which significantly modifies the us corporate income tax system due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tax act we have made reasonable estimates of its effects and recorded provisional amounts for the year ended december 31 2017 consistent with applicable sec guidance see details of the charge we recorded upon enactment of the tax act in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k these provisional amounts include a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets and liabilities and the establishment of a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits we are continuing to evaluate the tax act and its requirements as well as its application to our business and its impact on our ongoing effective tax rate the final impacts of the tax act may differ from current estimates and provisional amounts recorded possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related accounting interpretations in response to the tax act or updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the provisional impacts 

the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

we received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions qualified as generally taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code the opinions relied on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings including with respect to future conduct made by yum china and us if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the 

irs because the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge 

if notwithstanding receipt of any opinion the irs were to conclude that the yum china spinoff was taxable in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the yum china common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition each us holder of our common stock who received shares of yum china common stock in connection with the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of yum china common stock received that distribution would be taxable to each such us stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such us stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

the yum china spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

in february 2015 the chinese state administration of taxation “sat” issued the bulletin on several issues of enterprise income tax on income arising from indirect transfers of property by nonresident enterprises “bulletin 7” pursuant to bulletin 7 an “indirect transfer” of chinese taxable assets including equity interests in a china resident enterprise “chinese interests” by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of chinese taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of chinese enterprise income tax using general antitax avoidance provisions the sat may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of chinese interests if the transfer has avoided chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to chinese enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of up to 10 of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a china resident enterprise 

we evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 in connection with the separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose 

however there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10 assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of yum china as our tax basis in yum china was minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our yum® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the us and foreign jurisdictions however from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources we may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with the use of the proprietary knowhow concepts recipes or trade secrets used in our business defending against such claims may be costly and we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages royalties or other fees for using such proprietary information any of which could negatively affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions 

purchases at our concepts’ restaurants are discretionary for consumers and therefore our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment rates fluctuations in the level of disposable income the price of gasoline stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if our concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas and is expected to continue to increase increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain 

in connection with the announcement of our strategic transformation plans we have increased our indebtedness from approximately 4 billion to approximately 10 billion the proceeds from the debt were primarily used to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time which would intensify the risks related to our high level of indebtedness 

specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 

 

there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be 

able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

significant known events trends or uncertainties expected to impact future results 

strategic transformation initiatives impact 

we have refranchised a significant number of companyowned restaurants since the announcement of yum’s strategic transformation initiatives in october 2016 and anticipate that additional significant refranchising will occur in 2018 the impact on operating profit due to refranchising includes the loss of restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and the increase in franchise fees from restaurants that have been refranchised we expect to reduce ga including reductions directly attributable to refranchising such that upon completion of yum’s strategic transformation initiatives in 2019 on an annual basis the impact of lost operating profit from refranchising will be largely offset by ga reductions we are making however we expect that operating profit will be negatively impacted throughout 2018 as certain ga reductions lag the loss of operating profit due to refranchising we expect the impact of refranchising net of ga reductions to negatively impact core operating profit growth for 2018 by 6 to 7 percentage points 

gaap required change in accounting for revenue 

see “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 2 for discussion of the expected impact of changes in gaap related to revenue recognition 

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tax act” 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 see note 18 for discussion of the charge recorded upon enactment the tax act significantly modifies the us corporate income tax system by among other things reducing the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 limiting certain deductions including limiting the deductibility of interest expense to 30 of us earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda imposing a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and creating a territorial tax system that changes the manner in which future foreign earnings are subject to us tax 

after considering the impacts of the tax act we anticipate an ongoing effective tax rate of approximately 2022 compared to our previous guidance of 2627 while we expect to benefit from the lower us tax rate we anticipate this benefit will be partially offset by the limitation on the deductibility of interest the transition to a territorial tax system is expected to benefit our effective tax rate as a majority of our earnings are generated outside the us however this benefit is expected to be partially offset by taxes incurred under the global intangible lowtaxed income provisions of the tax act we currently expect that our 2018 effective tax rate will be slightly below the ongoing anticipated range noted above due to a delay in the applicability of the global intangible lowtaxed income provision and increased 2018 ebitda in the us due to our planned us refranchising gains which will lead to higher interest deductibility 

kfc united kingdom uk supply availability issues 

on february 14 2018 we and our franchisees transitioned to a new distributor for the food sold in our approximately 900 kfcs in the united kingdom and ireland those restaurants accounted for approximately 3 of yum’s global system sales in the year ended december 31 2017 in connection with this transition certain of these restaurants have experienced supply availability issues which have resulted in store closures or stores operating under a limited menu these supply availability issues continue through the date of this filing and it is difficult to predict with certainty when such issues may be resolved and all kfcs in the uk and ireland will be fully operational while the impact of lost profits as a result of these closures and limited menus has not been material through the date of this filing prolonged supply availability issues could have a material impact on our revenues additionally should the supply availability issues persist our franchisees suppliers and the distributor whose affiliates also service kfcs located in other countries within europe may experience financial distress or require credit support which could further impact our results of operations 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1030 million in 2017 vs 1248 million in 2016 the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in interest payments and retirement and deferred compensation payouts to retirees partially offset by an increase in operating profit before special items 

in 2016 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1248 million compared to 1260 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in interest payments partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments 

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 1472 million in 2017 versus net cash used in investing activities of 4 million in 2016 the increase was primarily driven by higher proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital spending 

in 2016 net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 4 million compared to 199 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by higher refranchising proceeds 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 1795 million in 2017 compared to 744 million in 2016 the increase was primarily driven by lower net borrowings partially offset by lower share repurchases 

in 2016 net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 744 million compared to 1089 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from net borrowings partially offset by higher share repurchases 

consolidated financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents increased due to significant refranchising proceeds received late in the year ended december 31 2017 as well as cash on hand to fund the march 2018 maturity of 325 million in yum senior unsecured notes 

the refranchising of companyoperated stores drove decreases in restaurantlevel assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including within property plant and equipment ppe 

deferred income taxes decreased in connection with the tax charge we recorded upon enactment of the tax act see note 18 

longterm debt increased during 2017 due to the issuance of 750 million of subsidiary senior unsecured notes partially offset by the reclassification of 325 million of yum senior unsecured notes to shortterm borrowings due to their march 2018 maturity date 

liquidity and capital resources 

in october 2016 we announced yum’s strategic transformation initiatives to drive global expansion of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands following the separation on october 31 2016 as part of this transformation we intend to own less than 1000 stores by the end of 2018 and by 2019 reduce annual recurring capital expenditures to approximately 100 million improve our efficiency by lowering ga to 17 of system sales and increase free cash flow conversion to 100 

in 2017 we returned 24 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends and we remain committed to returning between 65 and 70 billion from 2017 to 2019 we intend to fund these shareholder returns through a combination of refranchising proceeds free cash flow generation and maintenance of our five times ebitda leverage we anticipate generating total proceeds in excess of 2 billion net of tax in connection with our refranchising initiatives 

we have historically generated substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment our annual operating cash flows from continuing operations have historically been in excess of 1 billion going forward we anticipate that any decrease in operating cash flows from the operation of fewer companyowned stores due to refranchising will be offset with savings generated from decreased capital investment and ga required to support company operations to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds do not cover our anticipated cash needs we maintain 1 billion of undrawn capacity under our existing revolving credit facility 

o ur balance sheet often reflects a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and is also historically common for yum company sales are paid in cash or by credit card which is quickly converted into cash and our royalty receivables from franchisees are generally due within 30 days of the period in which the related sales occur substantial amounts of cash 

received have historically been either invested in new restaurant assets which are noncurrent in nature or returned to shareholders as part of our working capital strategy we negotiate favorable credit terms with vendors and as a result our onhand inventory turns faster than the related shortterm liabilities accordingly it is not unusual for current liabilities to exceed current assets we believe such a deficit has no significant impact on our liquidity or operations 

debt instruments 

as of december 31 2017 approximately 90 including the impact of interest rate swaps of our 98 billion of total debt outstanding is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 47 we are managing a capital structure which is levered inline with our target of approximately five times ebitda and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years we have credit ratings of bb standard  poorsba3 moodys with a balance sheet more consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies see note 11 for details of our financing activities supporting the return of capital initiative 

securitization notes in may 2016 taco bell funding llc a newly formed special purpose subsidiary of the company issued an aggregate of 23 billion of fixed rate senior secured notes “class a2 notes” in connection with the issuance of the class a2 notes taco bell funding llc also issued variable rate notes the “variable funding notes” and together with the class a2 notes the “securitization notes” pursuant to a new revolving financing facility which allowed for the borrowing of up to 100 million including the issuance of letters of credit up to 50 million on october 16 2017 taco bell funding llc terminated the variable funding notes the securitization notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the failure to pay principal on any outstanding securitization notes will constitute an event of default under any other securitization notes 

credit agreement on june 16 2016 three whollyowned subsidiaries of the company kfc holding co pizza hut holdings llc and taco bell of america llc as coborrowers the borrowers entered into a new credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for the following each of which may be increased subject to certain conditions i a 500 million term loan a facility the “term loan a facility” ii a 2 billion term loan b facility the “term loan b facility” and iii a 1 billion revolving facility the “revolving facility” which has no outstanding borrowings and has 4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2017 each of which may be increased subject to certain conditions our term loan a facility and term loan b facility contain crossdefault provisions whereby the failure to pay principal of or otherwise perform any agreement or condition under indebtedness of certain subsidiaries with a principal amount in excess of 100 million will constitute an event of default under the credit agreement 

subsidiary senior unsecured notes on june 16 2016 the borrowers issued an aggregate of 105 billion senior unsecured notes due 2024 and an aggregate of 105 billion senior unsecured notes due 2026 on june 15 2017 the borrowers issued an aggregate of 750 million senior unsecured notes due june 1 2027 together with the june 16 2016 issuances the “subsidiary senior unsecured notes” our subsidiary senior unsecured notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness of certain subsidiaries with a principal amount in excess of 100 million or the failure to pay principal of such indebtedness will constitute an event of default under the subsidiary senior unsecured notes 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured obligations yum senior unsecured notes which ranks equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under yum senior unsecured notes were 22 billion at december 31 2017 our yum senior unsecured notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the yum senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled within 30 days after notice

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2017 included 



 

 

 

 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from timetotime to improve the plan’s funded status at december 31 2017 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 59 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 71 million at our 2017 measurement date 

we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2018 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2018 and beyond 

our postretirement health care plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 5 million in 2017 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 15 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and 

property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 100 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

see the lease guarantees and franchise loan pool and equipment guarantees sections of note 20 for discussion of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has issued standards to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries these standards are effective for the company in our first quarter of 2018 and we will adopt the standards using the modified retrospective transition method see “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 2 for additional information regarding our adoption of the new revenue recognition standards 

in february 2016 the fasb issued a standard on the recognition and measurement of leases which is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring that substantially all lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and by requiring the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements this standard is effective for the company in our first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method we currently plan to adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements based on our current volume of store leases and subleases to franchisees see note 12 we expect this adoption will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; however we believe the impact will be less material over time as we execute our strategy to be at least 98 franchised by 2019 and thus are a party to fewer leases further we do not anticipate adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows 

in june 2016 the fasb issued a standard that requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held the standard is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 

in october 2016 the fasb issued a standard that requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs the guidance will require a modified retrospective application with a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of our first quarter of 2018 we anticipate a reduction in other assets of approximately 40 million upon adoption to writeoff the unamortized tax consequences of certain historical intraentity transfers of assets with an offsetting increase to our accumulated deficit 

in august 2017 the fasb issued a standard that refines and expands existing hedge accounting guidance the standard is effective for the company in our first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted we do not anticipate the impact of adopting this standard will be material to our financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we writedown the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from franchise royalties and companyowned restaurant operations if any 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth from net new restaurants or samesales growth and margin improvement for those reporting units which include companyowned restaurant operations assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2017 goodwill testing date 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty 

rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2017 refranchising activity completed by the company resulted in the writeoff of 36 million in goodwill within refranchising gain loss representing 7 of beginningofyear company goodwill of the 36 million the most significant writeoffs were recognized by kfc turkey and taco bell us within kfc turkey all remaining company restaurants were refranchised and 13 million in goodwill was written off representing 33 of beginningofyear goodwill within taco bell us 251 restaurants were refranchised representing 29 of beginningofyear company units and 8 million in goodwill was written off representing 7 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 20 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1007 million and a fair value of plan assets of 864 million at december 31 2017 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 390 at december 31 2017  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or standard  poors sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 65 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 75 million at our measurement date 

the net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2018 is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect net periodic benefit cost for our us plans to increase approximately 6 million in 2018  a 50 basispoint decrease in our discount rate assumption at our 2017 measurement date would further increase our 2018 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 9 million a 50 basispoint increase in our discount rate assumption at our 2017 measurement date would decrease our 2018 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 8 million the impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are reflected primarily in other pension income expense 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical and expected future returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2018 pension expense at december 31 2017 was 565 net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2018 us net periodic benefit cost by approximately 8 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 565 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 8 million the impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are recorded to other pension income expense 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 134 million included in aoci for these us plans at december 31 2017  we will recognize approximately 16 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2018 versus 5 million recognized in 2017 see note 15 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted fasb issued guidance related to the presentation of nonservice components of net periodic pension cost as a result expense associated with changes in actuarial assumptions settlement charges and other nonservice related charges are primarily recorded to other pension income expense 

income taxes 

at december 31 2017 we had valuation allowances of approximately 421 million to reduce our 847 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to foreign tax credits and temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2017 we had 100 million of unrecognized tax benefits 10 million of which are temporary in nature and if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 to address the accounting implications of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” sab 118 permits a company to recognize provisional amounts for the onetime tax effects of the tax act upon enactment when it does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law the measurement period to finalize our calculations cannot extend beyond one year of the enactment date key provisions that have a significant impact on our financial statements and where we have recognized estimated amounts include the recognition of liabilities for taxes on mandatory onetime deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets and liabilities and establishment of a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credit carryforwards 

the tax act includes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been provided have now been subject to us tax our cash currently held overseas is primarily limited to that necessary to fund working capital requirements thus we have not provided taxes on our foreign unremitted earnings other than us federal taxes provided in connection with the mandatory deemed repatriation tax as we believe they are indefinitely reinvested see note 18 for a further discussion of our income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us our outstanding longterm debt of 98 billion includes 75 fixedrate debt and 25 variablerate debt we have attempted to minimize the interest rate risk related to 155 billion of this variablerate debt through the use of interest rate swaps as a result approximately 90 of our 98 billion of outstanding debt at december 31 2017 is effectively fixedrate debt see note 11 for details on these issuances and repayments and note 13 for details related to interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swaps in an increase of approximately 9 million and 10 million respectively in interest expense net within our consolidated statements of income these estimated amounts are based upon the current level of variablerate debt that has not been swapped to fixed and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and exclude any impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 

the fair value of our cumulative fixedrate debt of 73 billion as of december 31 2017 would decrease approximately 400 million as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase at december 31 2017 a hypothetical 100 basispoint decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swaps approximately 50 million fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the durations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency denominated debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 20 billion as of december 31 2017  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 operating profit would have decreased approximately 180 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

narrative description of business 

general 

yum has over 43500 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories through the three concepts of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the “concepts” the company develops operates or franchises a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements which require payment of salesbased fees for use of our concepts brands the terms franchise or franchisee within this form 10k are meant to describe third parties that operate units under either franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut typically offers delivery service as does kfc on a more limited basis primarily in china 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and convenient food at competitive prices 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises the company utilizes both storelevel franchise and master franchise programs to grow its businesses under storelevel franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees contribute to the company’s revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales usually 4  6 under master franchise arrangements the company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as subfranchise within certain geographic territories master franchisees are responsible for overseeing development within their territories and collect initial fees and royalties from subfranchisees master franchisees often pay royalties at a reduced rate to the company our largest master franchisee yum china pays a 3 license fee on system sales of our concepts in mainland china to the company 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

following is a brief description of each concept

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches where sufficient scale allows area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit restaurants from time to time to promote adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply and distribution 

the company and franchisees of the concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane foodservice inc is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee stores 

outside the us we and our franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors we and our franchisees have approximately 5800 food and paper suppliers including usbased suppliers that export to many countries 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks 

the use of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business 

working capital 

information about the company’s working capital is included in mda in part ii item 7 and the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

seasonal operations 

the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree 

competition 

the retail food industry in which our concepts compete is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts competes with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

research and development “rd” 

the company operates rd facilities in plano texas kfc and pizza hut divisions irvine california taco bell division louisville kentucky kfc us and several other locations outside the us in addition to company rd we regularly also engage independent suppliers to conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the yum system the company expensed 24 million 24 million and 25 million in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively for rd activities 

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2016  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated 

government regulation

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis and salmonella occur or may occur within our system from time to time in addition food safety issues such as food tampering contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts’ restaurants including restaurants operated by us or our concepts’ franchisees or linking our competitors or our industry generally to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation and damages if a customer of our concepts becomes ill as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which would decrease our revenues in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales or the sales of our concepts’ franchisees the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic including various strains of avian flu or swine flu such as h1n1 the occurrence of such an outbreak of an epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments could materially disrupt our business and operations such events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary closure of restaurants which would severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having the avian flu or swine flu since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees or disinfect our restaurant facilities outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world and such outbreaks have resulted in confirmed human cases it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products this would likely result in lower revenues and profits avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues 

furthermore other viruses may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which our concepts’ restaurants operate impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our operating results and growth strategies are closely and increasingly tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are operated by our concepts’ franchisees in october 2016 in connection with the spinoff of our china business we announced our plan to become at least 98 franchised by the end of 2018 our refranchising efforts will increase our dependence on the financial success and cooperation of our concepts’ franchisees in addition our longterm system sales growth targets depend on an acceleration of our historical net system unit growth rate nearly all of this unit growth is expected to result from new unit openings by our franchisees if our franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development we may fall short of our system sales growth targets 

we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and the inability of franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments if our concepts’ franchisees incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in their financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments in addition we are contingently liable on certain of our concepts’ franchisees’ lease agreements including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees in connection with refranchising of certain company restaurants and our operating results could be impacted by any increased rent obligations for such leased properties 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our concepts’ franchisees to implement major initiatives which may include financial investment our concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for further growth if their franchisees do not participate which in turn may harm the growth prospects and financial condition of the company additionally the failure of our concepts’ franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations such as quality service and cleanliness even if such failures do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents could have a negative impact on our business 

we may not successfully implement our transformation initiatives or fully realize the anticipated benefits from the transformation 

on october 11 2016 we announced our strategic transformation plans to drive global expansion of our kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands following the spinoff of our china business among other things this transformation includes a plan to become at least 98 franchised by the end of 2018 and to significantly reduce annual capital expenditures and our general and administrative costs each by the end of 2019 we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our transformation initiatives further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of this transformation including the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency within expected timeframes is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are in turn subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control there is no assurance that we will successfully implement or fully realize the anticipated positive impact of our transformation initiatives or execute successfully on our transformation strategy in the expected timeframes or at all in addition there can be no assurance that our efforts if properly executed will result in our desired outcome of improved financial performance 

we have significant exposure to the chinese market through our largest franchisee yum china which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

in connection with the spinoff of our china business in october 2016 we entered into a master license agreement with yum china pursuant to which yum china is the exclusive licensee of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts and their related 

marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in china following the spinoff yum china is now our largest franchisee and our overall financial results are significantly affected by yum china’s results and our business is exposed to risks in china these risks include among others changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences the regulatory environment as well as increased media scrutiny of our business and industry fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and increased competition in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china operations if chinese consumers reduce the frequency of their visits to yum china’s restaurants chinese law regulates the scope of our business conducted within china our business is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties based on the policies of the chinese government as they may change from time to time 

our relationship with yum china is governed by a master license agreement which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of yum china in addition if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china if yum china is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the master license agreement or if the master license agreement is otherwise terminated it could result in an interruption in the operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to yum china for use in china such interruption could result in a delay in or loss of royalty income to us which would negatively impact our financial results 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us including in emerging markets and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption and social and ethnic unrest as well as changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws foreign exchange control regimes consumer preferences and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated in addition our franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes any failure to comply with such sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages the imposition of penalties suspension of business licenses or a cessation of operations at our franchisees’ businesses as well as damage to our and our concepts’ brands’ images and reputations all of which could harm our profitability 

foreign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi “rmb” australian dollar the british pound and the euro as well as currencies in certain other markets such as the malaysian ringgit and russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition the chinese government restricts the convertibility of rmb into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of china yum china’s income is almost exclusively derived from the earnings of its chinese subsidiaries with substantially all revenues of its chinese subsidiaries denominated in rmb any significant fluctuation in the value of the rmb could materially impact the us dollar value of royalty payments made to us by yum china which could result in lower revenues in addition restrictions on the conversion of rmb to us dollars or further restrictions on the remittance of currency out of china could result in delays in the remittance of yum china’s license fee which could impact our liquidity 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees and franchisees the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or if our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we our concepts and our concepts’ franchisees do business our failure to adhere to or 

successfully implement appropriate processes in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our and our brands’ reputations 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information via social media could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

in addition social media is frequently used by our concepts to communicate with their respective customers and the public in general failure by our concepts to use social media effectively or appropriately particularly as compared to our concept’s respective competitors could lead to a decline in brand value customer visits and revenue other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts’ brands exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we along with our concepts’ franchisees are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports the inability of vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms or other conditions beyond our control or the control of our concepts’ franchisees in the us the company along with representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment any failure or inability of rscs to perform its purchasing obligations could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies 

a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a key supplier or distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new supplier or distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may not achieve our target development goals aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees’ ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets around the world especially in emerging markets the successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees including yum china will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks that could impact our ability to increase the number of our restaurants include prevailing economic conditions and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified restaurant crews and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our concepts’ existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

labor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth harm our business and reduce our profitability 

restaurant operations are highly serviceoriented and our success depends in part upon our and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees including restaurant managers and other crew members the market for qualified employees in our industry is very competitive any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants by us and our concepts’ franchisees and could adversely impact our concepts’ existing restaurants any such delays material increases in employee turnover rate in existing restaurants or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our and our concepts’ franchisees’ business and results of operations 

in addition strikes work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common in the us in the event of a strike work slowdown or other labor unrest the ability to adequately staff our concept’s restaurants could be impaired which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities 

changes in labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

an increase in the costs of employee wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results such increases could result from government imposition of higher minimum wages or from general economic or competitive conditions any increase in such operating expenses could adversely affect our and our concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins in addition competition for qualified employees could also compel us or our concepts’ franchisees to pay higher wages to attract or retain key crew members which could result in higher labor costs and decreased profitability 

a broader standard for determining joint employer status may adversely affect our business operations and increase our liabilities resulting from actions by our concepts’ franchisees 

in 2015 the national labor relations board the “nlrb” adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act in addition the general counsel’s office of the nlrb has issued complaints naming mcdonald’s corporation as a joint employer of workers at its franchisees for alleged violations of the us fair labor standards act the nlrb’s proposed and evolving joint employer liability standard could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices violations of wage and hour laws and other violations and could also require our concepts to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of our concepts’ franchisees further there is no assurance that we or our concepts will not receive similar complaints as mcdonald’s corporation in the future which could result in legal proceedings based on the actions of our concepts’ franchisees in such events our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability 

an increase in food prices may have an adverse impact on our and our franchisees’ profit margins 

our and our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as protein including poultry pork beef and seafood cheese oil flour and vegetables including potatoes and lettuce raw materials purchased for use in our concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather conditions or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials as a result the historical prices of raw materials used in the operation of our concepts’ restaurants have fluctuated we cannot assure you that we or our concepts’ franchisees will continue to be able to purchase raw materials at reasonable prices or that raw materials prices will remain stable in the future in addition a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors 

because we and our concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food we may not have the ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any commodity price increases if we and our concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost 

of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately it may have an adverse impact on our and our franchisees’ profit margins 

our concepts’ brands may be limited or diluted through franchisee and thirdparty activity 

although we monitor and regulate franchisee activities through our franchise agreements franchisees or other third parties may refer to or make statements about our concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our concepts’ brands or place our concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation this may result in dilution of or harm to our intellectual property or the value of our concept’s brands 

franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our concepts’ brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices moreover unauthorized third parties may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our concepts’ brands resulting in consumer confusion or dilution any reduction of our concepts’ brands’ goodwill consumer confusion or dilution is likely to impact sales and could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ loyalty to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us franchisees competitors suppliers or distributors can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our concepts’ brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our suppliers distributors or franchisees regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true similarly entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct including alleged human rights abuses or environmental wrongdoing and any such conduct could damage our or our concepts’ brands’ reputations any such incidents even if resulting from actions of a competitor or franchisee could cause a decline directly or indirectly in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts’ brands andor our products and reduce consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits additionally our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or an employee or representative of us or a franchisee 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include consumer employment real estate related tort intellectual property breach of contract securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any such claims have merit or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources and management attention away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the restaurant industry around the world has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse effects these concerns could lead to an increase in the regulation of the content or marketing of our products we may also be subject to such claims in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

 

compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial results or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses internal investigations governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues 

failure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business operations 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing emphasis and enforcement around the world although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines and significant investigation costs and could also materially damage our reputation brands international expansion efforts and growth prospects business and operating results publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant percentage of our income is earned outside the us and currently taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates however if the cash generated by our us business is not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the us in the future we are required to record us income tax expense in our financial statements at the point in time when our management determines that we no longer have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone tax consequences related to those international earnings this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the us internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in legislation regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other 

jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

we received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the yum china spinoff and certain related transactions qualify as generally taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code the opinions relied on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings including with respect to future conduct made by yum china and us if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the irs because the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge 

if notwithstanding receipt of any opinion the irs were to conclude that the yum china spinoff was taxable in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the yum china common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition each us holder of our common stock who received shares of yum china common stock in the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of yum china common stock received that distribution would be taxable to each such us stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such us stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

the yum china spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

in february 2015 the chinese state administration of taxation “sat” issued the bulletin on several issues of enterprise income tax on income arising from indirect transfers of property by nonresident enterprises “bulletin 7” pursuant to bulletin 7 an “indirect transfer” of chinese taxable assets including equity interests in a china resident enterprise “chinese interests” by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of chinese taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of chinese enterprise income tax using general antitax avoidance provisions the sat may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of chinese interests if the transfer has avoided chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to chinese enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of up to 10 of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a china resident enterprise 

we evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 in connection with the separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose 

however given how recently bulletin 7 was promulgated there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10 assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of yum china as our tax basis in yum china was minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our yum® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the us and foreign jurisdictions however from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of 

significant resources we may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with the use of the proprietary knowhow concepts recipes or trade secrets used in our business defending against such claims may be costly and we may be prohibited from using such proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages royalties or other fees for using such proprietary information any of which could negatively affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions 

purchases at our restaurants are discretionary for consumers and therefore our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment rates fluctuations in the level of disposable income the price of gasoline stock market performance and changes in the level of consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if our concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain 

in 2016 we increased our indebtedness from approximately 4 billion to approximately 9 billion the proceeds from the debt were primarily used to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time which would intensify the risks related to our high level of indebtedness 

specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 

 

there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to pay our 

indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

in 2015 the increase in ga expenses was driven by higher incentive compensation costs investment spending on strategic growth and technology initiatives higher us pension costs higher litigation costs and the creation of the live más scholarship 

operating profit 

in 2016 the increase in operating profit excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and 53 rd week was driven by samestore sales growth net new unit growth and lower ga expenses partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and refranchising 

in 2015 the increase in operating profit was driven by samestore sales growth and net new unit growth partially offset by higher ga expenses 

corporate  unallocated 



corporate ga expenses 

in 2016 the increase in corporate ga expenses was driven by incremental costs associated with yums strategic transformation initiatives see note 5 noncash charges associated with the modification of certain executive income deferral “eid” sharebased compensation awards see note 5  retirement plan settlement charges see note 5 and higher incentive compensation costs partially offset by lower professional and legal fees 

in 2015 the increase in corporate ga expenses was driven by higher pension costs 

unallocated franchise and license fees and income 

in 2016 unallocated franchise and license fees and income reflects charges related to the kfc us acceleration agreement see note 5

in 2015 and 2014 unallocated other income expense primarily includes foreign exchange losses 

interest expense net 

the increase in interest expense net for 2016 was driven by increased outstanding borrowings see note 11

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1204 million in 2016 versus 1213 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in interest payments partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments 

in 2015 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1213 million compared to 1217 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions offset by lapping higher income tax payments in the prior year 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 24 million in 2016 compared to 189 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by higher refranchising proceeds and lower capital spending 

in 2015 net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 189 million compared to 424 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily driven by higher refranchising proceeds and lower capital spending 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 677 million in 2016 compared to 1058 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from net borrowings partially offset by higher share repurchases 

in 2015 net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 1058 million compared to 739 million in 2014 the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases and dividends partially offset by higher net borrowings 

consolidated financial condition 

during 2016 we issued 69 billion in new debt and repaid 16 billion of borrowings that were outstanding as of december 26 2015 see note 11 for detail on these debt issuances and repayments shareholders’ equity deficit declined 66 billion due primarily to share repurchases of 54 billion and the spinoff of our china business 

liquidity and capital resources 

in october 2015 we announced our intent to separate our former china business into an independent publiclytraded company and become more of a pure play franchisor with more stable earnings higher profit margins lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion additionally we announced our intention to return substantial capital to shareholders the majority of which was to be funded by incremental borrowings since the fourth quarter of 2015 through december 31 2016 we have repurchased 79 million shares of our common stock for 63 billion including 54 billion in 2016 over the same period we have paid cash dividends of 942 million including 744 million in 2016 for a total return to shareholders of 72 billion 



 

see note 17 for additional details related to our share repurchase activity 

we completed 69 billion of debt financing transactions during 2016 to assist in funding the shareholder returns noted above as of december 31 2016 approximately 90 including the impact of interest rate swaps of our 91 billion of total debt outstanding is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 47 we have transitioned to noninvestment grade credit ratings 

of bb standard  poorsba3 moodys with a balance sheet more consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies we are now managing a capital structure which is levered inline with our target of approximately five times ebitda and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years see note 11 for details of our financing activities supporting the return of capital initiative 

in october 2016 we announced yum’s strategic transformation initiatives to drive global expansion of the kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands following the separation on october 31 2016 as part of this transformation we intend to own less than 1000 stores by the end of 2018 and by 2019 reduce annual runrate capital expenditures to approximately 100 million improve our efficiency by lowering ga expenses to 17 of system sales and increase free cash flow conversion to 100 

over the next 3 years we intend to return an additional 65 to 70 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends we intend to fund these additional shareholder returns through a combination of free cash flow generation refranchising proceeds and maintenance of our five times ebitda leverage we anticipate generating proceeds in excess of 2 billion net of tax through the refranchising of over 2000 stores 

we have historically generated substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment our annual operating cash flows from continuing operations have approximated 12 billion each of the past three years going forward we anticipate that any decrease in operating cash flows from the operation of fewer companyowned stores due to refranchising will be offset with savings generated from decreased capital investment and ga expense required to support company operations to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds do not cover our anticipated cash needs we maintain 1 billion of undrawn capacity under our existing revolving credit facility 

o ur balance sheet often reflects a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and is also historically common for yum company sales are paid in cash or by credit card which is quickly converted into cash and our royalty receivables from franchisees are generally due within 30 days of the period in which the related sales occur substantial amounts of cash received have historically been either invested in new restaurant assets which are noncurrent in nature or returned to shareholders as part of our working capital strategy we negotiate favorable credit terms with vendors and as a result our onhand inventory turns faster than the related shortterm liabilities accordingly it is not unusual for current liabilities to exceed current assets we believe such a deficit has no significant impact on our liquidity or operations 

we generate a significant amount of cash from operating activities outside the us that we have used historically to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including returns to shareholders and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a taxefficient manner if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us businesses or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

borrowing capacity 

securitization notes in may 2016 taco bell funding llc a newly formed special purpose subsidiary of the company issued an aggregate of 23 billion of fixed rate senior secured notes “class a2 notes” in connection with the issuance of the class a2 notes taco bell funding llc also issued variable rate notes the “variable funding notes” and together with the class a2 notes the “securitization notes” pursuant to a new revolving financing facility which allows for the borrowing of up to 100 million including the issuance of letters of credit up to 50 million we have no outstanding borrowings related to the variable funding notes and have 15 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2016 related to this facility the securitization notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the failure to pay principal on any outstanding securitization notes will constitute an event of default under any other securitization notes 

the company used certain of the proceeds from the sale of the class a2 notes to pay down the entire outstanding balance of 2 billion of its unsecured shortterm loan credit facility bridge facility at which time the bridge facility was terminated as well as to pay related fees and expenses and fund certain accounts related to the securitization notes the remaining proceeds of the securitization notes were used to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and for general corporate purposes 

credit agreement in june 2016 three whollyowned subsidiaries of the company kfc holding co pizza hut holdings llc and taco bell of america llc as coborrowers the borrowers entered into a new credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for i a 500 million term loan a facility the “term loan a facility” ii a 2 billion term loan b facility the “term loan b facility” and iii a 1 billion revolving facility the “revolving facility” which has no outstanding borrowings 

and has 5 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2016 each of which may be increased subject to certain conditions our term loan a facility and term loan b facility contain crossdefault provisions whereby the failure to pay principal of or otherwise perform any agreement or condition under indebtedness of certain subsidiaries with a principal amount in excess of 100 million will constitute an event of default under the credit agreement 

subsidiary senior unsecured notes on june 16 2016 the borrowers issued an aggregate of 105 billion senior unsecured notes due 2024 and an aggregate of 105 billion senior unsecured notes due 2026 together the “subsidiary senior unsecured notes” our subsidiary senior unsecured notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness of certain subsidiaries with a principal amount in excess of 100 million or the failure to pay principal of such indebtedness will constitute an event of default under the subsidiary senior unsecured notes 

we used certain of the proceeds from the subsidiary senior unsecured notes and the term loan a facility and the term loan b facility to repay all outstanding amounts under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “senior unsecured revolving credit facility” which had outstanding borrowings of 701 million as of december 26 2015 concurrent with this repayment the senior unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated the remaining proceeds are being used to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and for general corporate purposes 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured obligations yum senior unsecured notes which ranks equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness the yum senior unsecured notes have varying maturity dates from 2018 through 2043 and stated interest rates ranging from 375 to 688 amounts outstanding under yum senior unsecured notes were 22 billion at december 31 2016 our yum senior unsecured notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the yum senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled within 30 days after notice 

the following table summarizes the future maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding capital leases as of december 31 2016 



as a result of issuing the securitization notes and the subsidiary senior unsecured notes and executing the credit agreement we have completed our recapitalization plan full year 2016 interest expense was 333 million and we currently expect annualized interest expense of approximately 430 million based on existing debt levels and current interest rates on our variablerate debt 

see note 11 for details on the the securitization notes subsidiary senior unsecured notes the credit agreement and yum senior unsecured notes 

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2016 included 



 

 

 

 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from timetotime to improve the plan’s funded status at december 31 2016 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 58 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 44 million at our 2016 measurement date 

we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2017 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2017 and beyond 

our postretirement health care plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 5 million in 2016 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 15 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 4 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table certain commitments associated with the kfc us acceleration agreement see note 5 as we cannot reliably estimate the specific timing of the remaining investments to be made in each of the next two years in connection with this agreement we anticipate investing a total of approximately 120 million from 2015 through 2018 primarily to fund new backofhouse equipment for franchisees and to provide incentives to accelerate franchisee store remodels of which 98 million has been invested through 2016 

offbalance sheet arrangements

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries the standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method in march and april 2016 the fasb issued the following amendments to clarify the implementation of asu 201409 asu no 201608 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net and asu no 201610 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 identifying performance obligations and licensing  we intend to adopt the new standards using the full retrospective transition method in the first quarter of 2018 

we do not believe these standards will impact the recognition of our two largest sources of revenue sales in companyowned restaurants and salesbased continuing fees from franchisees additionally we do not expect the new standards will materially impact the recognition of refranchising gains and losses as these transactions are divestitures of businesses and thus outside the scope of the standards see note 2 for a description of our current accounting policies 

the standards require that the transaction price received from customers be allocated to each separate and distinct performance obligation the transaction price attributable to each separate and distinct performance obligation is then recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied we are currently evaluating the standards to determine whether the services we provide related to upfront fees we receive from franchisees such as initial or renewal fees contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right if we determine these services are not separate and distinct from the overall franchise right the fees received will be recognized as revenue over the term of each respective franchise agreement we currently recognize upfront franchise fees such as initial and renewal fees when the related services have been provided which is when a store opens for initial fees and when renewal options become effective for renewal fees the standards require the unamortized portion of fees received to be presented in our consolidated balance sheets as a contract liability any contract liabilities required to be recorded as a result of adopting these standards may be material to our consolidated balance sheets given the volume of our franchise agreements and their duration which is typically equal to or in excess of ten years 

similarly we are currently evaluating whether the benefits we receive from incentive payments we may make to our franchisees eg equipment funding provided under the kfc us acceleration agreement see note 5 are separate and distinct from the benefits we receive from the franchise right if they cannot be separated from the franchise right then such incentive payments would be amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the franchise agreement currently we recognize any payments made to franchisees within our consolidated statements of income when we are obligated to make the payment 

we are also evaluating whether the standards will have an impact on transactions currently not included in our revenues such as franchisee contributions to and subsequent expenditures from advertising cooperatives that we are required to consolidate we act as an agent in regard to these franchisee contributions and expenditures and as such we do not currently include them in our consolidated statements of income or cash flows see note 2 for details we are evaluating whether the new standards will impact the principalagent determinations in these arrangements if we determine we are the principal in these arrangements we would include contributions to and expenditures from these advertising cooperatives within our consolidated statements of income and cash flows while any such change has the potential to materially impact our gross amount of reported revenues and expenses such impact would largely be offsetting and we would not expect there to be a significant impact on our reported net income 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842  which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring that substantially all lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements asu 201602 is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we currently plan to adopt asu 201602 in the first quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements based on our current volume of store leases and subleases see note 12 to franchisees we expect this adoption will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets however we believe the impact will be less material over time as we execute our strategy to be at least 98 franchised by 2019 and thus are a party to fewer leases further we do not anticipate adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 c ompensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions including their income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows asu 201609 is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 upon adoption of this standard excess tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation which we currently recognize within 

common stock will be reflected within the income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income additionally our consolidated statements of cash flows will present such excess tax benefits which are currently presented as a financing activity as an operating activity the impact of adopting this standard on our financial statements will be dependent on the timing and intrinsic value of future sharebased compensation award exercises given the current intrinsic value of our outstanding sharebased compensation awards we currently anticipate a significant impact to our reported tax rate as exercises occur 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  which requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held asu 201613 is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs the guidance will require a modified retrospective application with a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 but permits adoption at the beginning of an earlier annual period we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu 201616 on our financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we writedown the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the 

reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from companyowned restaurant operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2016 goodwill testing date 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2016 the companys reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were pizza hut us and taco bell us within pizza hut us 195 restaurants were refranchised representing 38 of beginningofyear company units and 3 million in goodwill was written off representing 4 of beginningofyear goodwill within taco bell us 46 restaurants were refranchised representing 5 of beginningofyear company units and 2 million in goodwill was written off representing 2 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 20 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 993 million and a fair value of plan assets of 837 million at december 31 2016 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos 

are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 460 at december 31 2016  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or standard  poors sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 60 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 65 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2017 is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans excluding the impact of settlement charges associated with the deferred vested payout program in 2016 see note 5 to be largely unchanged in 2017  a 50 basispoint decrease in our discount rate assumption at our 2016 measurement date would increase our 2017 us pension expense by approximately 8 million a 50 basispoint increase in our discount rate assumption at our 2016 measurement date would decrease our 2017 us pension expense by approximately 4 million 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2017 pension expense at december 31 2016 was 65 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2017 us pension expense by approximately 8 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 65 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 8 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 150 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for these us plans at december 31 2016  we will recognize approximately 7 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2017 versus 6 million recognized in 2016 see note 15 

income taxes 

at december 31 2016 we had valuation allowances of approximately 195 million to reduce our 11 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to capital loss carryforwards and temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire and us foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2016 we had 91 million of unrecognized tax benefits 87 million of which are temporary in nature and if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

we have investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis we have not provided deferred tax on the portion of the excess that we believe is indefinitely reinvested as we have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence we estimate that our total temporary difference upon which we have not provided deferred tax is approximately 21 billion at december 31 2016 a determination of the deferred tax liability on this amount is not practicable 

if our intentions regarding our ability and intent to postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence change deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us our outstanding longterm debt of 91 billion includes 73 fixedrate debt and 27 variablerate debt we have attempted to minimize the interest rate risk related to 155 billion of this variablerate debt through the use of interest rate swaps as a result approximately 90 of our 91 billion of outstanding debt at december 31 2016 is effectively fixedrate debt see note 11 for details on these issuances and repayments and note 13 for details related to interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swaps in an increase of approximately 10 million and 14 million respectively in interest expense net within our consolidated statements of income these estimated amounts are based upon the current level of variablerate debt that has not been swapped to fixed and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 

the fair value of our cumulative fixedrate debt of 66 billion as of december 31 2016 would decrease approximately 375 million as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase at december 31 2016 a hypothetical 100 basispoint decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swaps approximately 55 million fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the durations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency denominated debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 21 billion as of december 31 2016  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 operating profit would have decreased approximately 105 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

in october 2015 we announced our intent to separate yums china business from yum into an independent publiclytraded company by the end of 2016 see our mda in this form 10k for further information 

narrative description of business 

general 

yum has over 42000 restaurants in more than 130 countries and territories primarily through the three concepts of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publiclytraded companies 

the china division based in shanghai china comprises 7176 units primarily companyowned kfcs and pizza huts in 2015 the china division recorded revenues of approximately 69 billion and operating profit of 757 million the company owns a controlling interest in little sheep group limited little sheep a casual dining concept headquartered in inner mongolia china we also own noncontrolling interests in chinese entities who operate in a manner similar to kfc franchisees and a meat processing entity that supplies lamb to the little sheep business the kfc division comprises 14577 units operating in 120 countries and territories outside china and india and recorded revenues of approximately 29 billion and operating profit of 677 million in 2015 the pizza hut division comprises 13728 units operating in 90 countries and territories outside china and india and recorded revenues of approximately 11 billion and operating profit of 289 million in 2015 the taco bell division comprises 6400 units operating in 20 countries and territories outside of india and recorded revenues of approximately 20 billion and operating profit of 539 million in 2015 the india division based in delhi india comprises 811 units operating in 4 countries and recorded revenues of 115 million and an operating loss of 19 million in 2015 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut typically offers delivery service as does kfc on a more limited basis primarily in china 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and convenient food at competitive prices 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees contribute to the company’s revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

following is a brief description of each concept

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit restaurants from time to time to promote adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply   and distribution 

the company’s concepts including concept units operated by its franchisees are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

china division   in china we partner with approximately 450 independent food and paper suppliers mostly chinabased providing a wide range of products the company along with multiple independently owned and operated distributors utilizes approximately 20 logistic centers to distribute restaurant products to our company and franchise stores we also own a seasoning facility and a noncontrolling interest in a meat processing facility in inner mongolia both of which supply products to our little sheep business as well as thirdparty customers 

other divisions in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores the company entered into an agreement with mclane effective january 1 2011 relating to distribution to companyowned restaurants this agreement extends through december 31 2016 and generally restricts companyowned restaurants from using alternative distributors for most products 

outside the us we and our franchisees use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors we have approximately 5700 food and paper suppliers including usbased suppliers that export to many countries 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks 

the use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in our franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business 

working capital 

information about the company’s working capital is included in mda in part ii item 7 and the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

seasonal operations 

the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree 

competition 

the retail food industry in which our concepts compete is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience location and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts competes with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

research and development “rd” 

the company operates rd facilities in shanghai china china division plano texas kfc and pizza hut divisions irvine california taco bell division louisville kentucky kfc us and several other locations outside the us in addition to company rd we regularly also engage independent suppliers to conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the yum system the company expensed 29 million 30 million and 31 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively for rd activities 

environmental matters

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

risks related to our business and industry 

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis and salmonella occur or may occur within our system from time to time in addition food safety issues such as food tampering contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants including restaurants operated by our concepts’ franchisees to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation and damages if a customer of our concepts becomes ill from foodborne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which would decrease our revenues in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety 

issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors or suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

our significant china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located and our revenues and profits originate in china as a consequence our overall financial results are heavily dependent on our results in china and our business is significantly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences taxation including income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and the regulatory environment as well as increased media scrutiny of our business and industry and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the chinese renminbi could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

although we have announced our intention to separate our china business through a spinoff to existing shareholders following the spinoff the new china entity will be our largest franchisee or licensee and we will therefore continue to be exposed to many of the foregoing risks even after the completion of the proposed spinoff 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world and these outbreaks could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products this would likely result in lower revenues and profits avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

furthermore other viruses such as h1n1 or “swine flu” may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws foreign exchange control regimes and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro as well as currencies in certain emerging markets such as the russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers and employees the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution restrictions on imports or exports the inability of our vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a principal distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may not attain our target development goals aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the us especially in china and other emerging markets the successful development of new units depends in large part on our ability and the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

changes in commodity labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

an increase in certain commodity prices such as food supply and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time such increases could result from government imposition of higher minimum wages or from general economic or competitive conditions which could affect wage rates in addition significant increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors any increase in the prices of the commodities we use or operating expenses we incur could adversely affect our profit margins because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food our ability to pass along increased expenses to our customers is limited 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees and licensees 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated by franchisees and licensees from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenues in the form of royalty payments as a result the success of our business depends in part upon the operational and financial success of our concepts’ franchisees and licensees we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ and licensees’ businesses are run and the inability of franchisees or licensees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments 

if franchisees or licensees incur too much debt if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee or licensee or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees or licensees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability and our franchisees’ and licensees’ ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ connection to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us our franchisees licensees or suppliers can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true similarly entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct including alleged human rights abuses that damages our or our brands’ reputations any such incident could cause a decline in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts andor our products and decrease the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits additionally our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or representative 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including weblogs blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts exposure of personally identifiable information fraud and disclosure of outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are regularly involved in legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort intellectual property breach of contract securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues including weight gain and other adverse 

effects we may also be subject to these types of claims in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the retail food industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

 

compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial condition or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues 

a broader standard for determining joint employer status may adversely affect our business operations and increase our liabilities 

the national labor relations board has recently adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act if this joint employer liability standard is upheld or adopted by other government agencies it could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and required to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our franchisees in such event our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability 

failure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws may adversely affect our business operations 

the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing scrutiny and enforcement around the world although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines and significant investigation costs and could also materially damage our reputation brands international expansion efforts and prospects business and operating results publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant percentage of our profit is earned outside the us and taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates historically the cash we generate outside the us has principally been used to fund our international development however if the cash 

generated by our us business is not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the us in the future we are required to record us income tax expense in our financial statements at the point in time when our management determines that we no longer have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone tax consequences related to those international earnings this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us these reviews could include challenges of our methodologies for transfer pricing if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in such legislation regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the base erosion profit shifting project initiated by the organization for economic cooperation and development 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our yum® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment disposable income the price of gasoline stock market performance and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery convenience deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our profit margins   

we intend to substantially increase our level of debt which would make us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns and could adversely affect our business 

in late 2015 we announced that we intend to return approximately 62 billion of capital to shareholders prior to the separation of our china business through share repurchases andor a special dividend to finance that return of capital we expect to incur 

significant additional indebtedness some of which may be secured debt this would have the effect of substantially increasing our total leverage 

an increase in our leverage could have important potential consequences including but not limited to 

 

there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

risks related to the planned spinoff 

the proposed spinoff of our china business is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all and will involve significant time and attention which could disrupt or adversely affect our business 

we have announced our intention to separate yums china business from yum into an independent publiclytraded company by the end of 2016 this transaction which is expected to be a us taxfree spinoff of our china business is complex in nature subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market regulatory and certain other conditions we expect to file a registration statement on form 10 with the securities and exchange commission “sec” that will contain detailed information regarding the business proposed to be spunoff completion of the spinoff will be contingent upon a number of factors including the effectiveness of the registration statement final approval by our board of directors receipt of a tax opinion and other conditions for these and other reasons the spinoff may not be completed as expected by the end of 2016 if at all 

additionally execution of the proposed spinoff will require significant time and attention from management which may distract management from the operation of our business and the execution of our other initiatives our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spinoff we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the spinoff and following its completion any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the proposed spinoff may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits and may adversely affect our business 

even if the proposed spinoff is completed we may not achieve or may not achieve in a timely fashion some or all of the expected benefits of the spinoff and the spinoff may in fact adversely affect our business for example once the china business becomes independent it may choose to pursue growth opportunities with brands or businesses unrelated to our concepts which could divert attention and resources away from the growth of our concepts in china 

in addition if the spinoff is completed the company’s operational and financial profile and the composition of the company’s revenue will change materially there can be no assurance that these changes will yield the benefits currently expected or intended 

or that the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies following the completion of the proposed spinoff will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spinoff not occurred 

the spinoff transactions could result in substantial us tax liability 

the spinoff will be conditioned on our receipt of an opinion of outside counsel in form and substance satisfactory to us substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain related transactions will qualify under sections 355 andor 368 of the us internal revenue code the opinion will rely on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the new china entity and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion the opinion will not be binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail 

if notwithstanding receipt of the opinion the spinoff transaction were determined to be a taxable transaction we would be treated as having sold shares of the new china entity in a taxable transaction likely resulting in a significant taxable gain in addition each us holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new china entity in the spinoff transaction would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of the new china entity received that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

at the time of the spinoff we will enter into a tax matters agreement with the new china entity the tax matters agreement will address which company yum or the new china entity will be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of the spinoff transaction 

the spinoff may be subject to china indirect transfer tax 

the china state administration of taxation recently issued bulletin 7 on income arising from indirect transfers of assets by nonresident enterprises pursuant to bulletin 7 an indirect transfer of people’s republic of china prc taxable assets including equity interests in a prc resident enterprise by a nonresident enterprise may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of prc taxable assets if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of prc enterprise income tax as a result gains derived from such an indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax of 10 

we have evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 to our plan to separate our china business in a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose 

however given how recently bulletin 7 was promulgated there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the taxing authorities will ultimately view our planned spinoff as a result our position could be challenged by the tax authorities resulting in a 10 tax assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of the separated china business as our tax basis in the china business is minimal the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

if the proposed spinoff is consummated there may be substantial changes in our stockholder base which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate following the proposed spinoff 

investors holding yum’s common stock today may hold yum common stock because of a decision to invest in a company with significant china or emerging markets exposure if the proposed spinoff is completed shares of yum common stock will represent an investment in a company with less exposure to china a key emerging market this change may not match some holders’ investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their shares of yum common stock excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of yum common stock to decrease following the completion of the proposed spinoff

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

introduction and overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements “financial statements” in item 8 and the forwardlooking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a 

yum brands inc “yum” or the “company” operates franchises or licenses a worldwide system of over 42000 restaurants in more than 130 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc pizza hut or taco bell collectively the concepts brands these three concepts are the global leaders in the chicken pizza and mexicanstyle food categories respectively of the over 42000 restaurants 21 are operated by the company and its subsidiaries and 79 are operated by franchisees licensees or unconsolidated affiliates 

as of december 26 2015 yum consists of five operating segments 

 

effective january 2016 the india division was segmented by brand integrated into the global kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions and is no longer a separate operating segment while our consolidated results will not be impacted we will restate our historical segment information during 2016 for consistent presentation 

in october 2015 we announced our intent to separate yum’s china business from yum into an independent publiclytraded company by the end of 2016 this transaction which is expected to be a taxfree spinoff of our china business will create two powerful independent focused growth companies with distinct strategies financial profiles and investment characteristics the new china entity will become a licensee of yum in mainland china with exclusive rights to the kfc pizza hut and taco bell concepts upon completion of the planned spinoff yum will become more of a pure play franchisor with more stable earnings higher profit margins lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion consistent with this strategy yum is targeting 96 franchisee ownership of its restaurants by the end of 2017 

yum has announced its intention to return substantial capital to shareholders prior to this planned spinoff the majority of which will be funded by incremental borrowings with this recapitalization the company is transitioning to a noninvestment grade credit rating with a balance sheet more consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies moreover this will allow for an ongoing returnofcapital framework that will seek to optimize the companys longterm growth rate on a pershare basis 

completion of the spinoff will be subject to certain conditions including receiving final approval from the yum board of directors receipt of various regulatory approvals receipt of an opinion of counsel with respect to certain tax matters the effectiveness of filings related to public listing and applicable securities laws and other terms and conditions as may be determined by the board of directors there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed 

our historical ongoing earnings growth model has targeted a 10 earnings per share “eps” growth rate which was based on operating profit growth targets of 15 in china 10 for our kfc division 8 for our pizza hut division and 6 for our taco bell division see the division discussions within the results of operations section of this mda for further details on our divisions 2015 targets 

yum’s 2016 operating profit is expected to grow 10 in constant currency including the impact of 2016 having a 53 rd  week while we expect to spin off our china business prior to the end of 2016 this target assumes our china business will remain part of yum through the end of 2016 yums 2016 target is based on operating profit growth instead of eps growth given the uncertainties surrounding the specific timing and pricing of our 2016 shareholder capital returns 

subsequent to the spinoff of our china business we are targeting about 15 ongoing eps growth for the new china entity and about 15 ongoing total shareholder return for the remaining ongoing yum business the new china entitys 15 eps growth includes contributions from both operating profit and financial strategies such as share repurchases yums 15 total shareholder return includes ongoing operating profit growth targets of 10 for our kfc division 8 for our pizza hut division and 6 for 

our taco bell division which are consistent with our historical ongoing earnings growth model the 15 total shareholder return also includes 1 to 2 growth from the china license fee 3 to 5 growth from financial strategies and approximately 2 yield from dividends 

we intend for this mda to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations including performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following performance metrics

results of operations 

summary 

all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of special items all system sales growth and operating profit comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency 

2015 diluted eps increased 3 to 318 per share versus our target of 10 growth as sales and profits at our china division did not recover as strongly as expected and adverse foreign currency translation significantly impacted reported earnings 

we expected china division sales and profits to grow significantly in the second half of 2015 as we recovered from the adverse publicity in july 2014 surrounding improper food handling practices of a former supplier china division sales initially turned significantly positive as we lapped the july 2014 supplier incident but overall sales in the second half of 2015 trailed our expectations particularly at pizza hut casual dining kfc china grew same stores sales 3 in q3 and 6 in q4 while pizza hut casual dining samestore sales declined 1 in q3 and 8 in q4 for the year china division samestore sales declined 4 

foreign currency translation from our international operations negatively impacted eps growth by 6 percentage points

corporate  unallocated 



corporate ga expenses 

in 2015 the increase in corporate ga expenses was driven by higher professional fees and higher pension costs 

in 2014 the decrease in corporate ga expenses was driven by lower pension costs including lapping higher pension settlement charges partially offset by higher professional fees 

unallocated franchise and license expenses 

in 2015 unallocated franchise and license expenses represent charges related to the kfc us acceleration agreement see note 4 

unallocated closures and impairments 

in 2014 and 2013 unallocated closures and impairments represent little sheep impairment charges see note 4 

other unallocated 

in 2015 other unallocated primarily includes foreign exchange losses and a writedown related to our decision to dispose of a corporate aircraft in china 

in 2014 and 2013 other unallocated primarily includes foreign exchange losses 

interest expense net 

the increase in interest expense net for 2015 was driven by increased net shortterm borrowings 

the decrease in interest expense net for 2014 was driven by lapping 118 million of premiums paid and other costs related to the extinguishment of debt in 2013 see note 4 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2139 million in 2015 versus 2049 million in 2014 the increase was primarily driven by lapping higher income tax payments in the prior year partially offset by higher pension contributions 

in 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 2049 million compared to 2139 million in 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid 

net cash used in investing activities was 682 million in 2015 compared to 936 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily driven by higher refranchising proceeds and lower capital spending 

in 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 936 million compared to 886 million in 2013 the increase was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds partially offset by lapping the acquisition of restaurants in turkey from an existing franchisee in april 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 1292 million in 2015 compared to 1114 million in 2014 the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases and dividends partially offset by higher net borrowings 

in 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 1114 million compared to 1451 million in 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

consolidated financial condition 

the increase in our shortterm borrowings is primarily due to the outstanding balance of 600 million on a new term loan facility and the reclassification of 300 million senior unsecured notes as shortterm due to their april 2016 maturity date partially offset by the maturity of 250 million senior unsecured notes in september 2015 

longterm debt is also impacted by outstanding borrowings of 701 million under our revolving credit facility as of december 26 2015 see note 10 

other liabilities and deferred credits declined 277 million primarily due to actuarial gains and cash contributions related to our pension plans 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the retail food industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 2 billion each of the last five fiscal years these operating cash flows have largely funded our historical capital spending and returns to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases 

to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds have not covered our desired levels of capital spending and returns to shareholders we have had borrowing capacity to fund shortfalls net cash provided by operating activities refranchising proceeds capital spending repurchases of shares of common stock and dividends paid on common stock each of the last three years are as follows 



we generate a significant amount of cash from operating activities outside the us that we have used historically to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including returns to shareholders and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a taxefficient manner 

if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us businesses or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

as previously noted we intend to spinoff our china business from yum into an independent publiclytraded company prior to the end of 2016 upon completion of the planned spinoff yum will become more of a “pure play” franchisor with more stable earnings higher profit margins lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion 

yum has announced its intention to return approximately 62 billion of capital to shareholders prior to this planned spinoff the majority of which would be funded by incremental borrowings we expect these incremental borrowings to occur as the company transitions to a noninvestment grade credit rating with a balance sheet more consistent with highlylevered peer restaurant franchise companies 

as part of our intention to return up to 62 billion to shareholders we began increasing our rate of share repurchases in october 2015 in december 2015 we entered into a 15 billion shortterm credit facility to help fund these share repurchases and there were 600 million of outstanding borrowings related to this facility as of december 26 2015 we expect to borrow an additional 52 billion in 2016 

when we announced our recapitalization plan our credit ratings were lowered to noninvestment grade by both standard  poors bb and moodys investor services ba3 this downgrade did not significantly impact our 2015 borrowing costs and we do not expect it to impact our ability to execute our recapitalization plan or the balance of our planned shareholder returns while we do not anticipate any further downgrade to our credit rating such a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 26 2015 our interest expense would not materially increase on a fullyear basis should we receive a further onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 13 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in march 2017 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from 23 million to 115 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 26 2015 our unused credit facility totaled 594 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 5 million and outstanding borrowings of 701 million the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 100 to 175 over the “london interbank offered rate” “libor” the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

on december 8 2015 we entered into a credit agreement providing for an unsecured term loan facility the “shortterm loan credit facility” in an amount up to 15 billion which matures in june 2016 with an option for yum to extend maturity for an additional three months and includes three participating banks this credit agreement is being used to fund a portion of our planned capital returns to shareholders 

under the terms of the shortterm loan credit facility we may borrow up to the full amount of the facility in up to three draws at december 26 2015 our unused shortterm loan credit facility totaled 900 million net of outstanding borrowings of 600 million the interest rate for most borrowings under the shortterm loan credit facility ranges from 100 to 175 over libor the exact spread over libor under the shortterm loan credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the shortterm loan credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

both the credit facility and the shortterm loan credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contain financial covenants relating to the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the agreements for both credit facilities also contain affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 26 2015 with a considerable amount of cushion additionally both facilities contain crossdefault provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 125 million or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness will constitute a default under such agreement 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2016 through 2043 and stated interest rates ranging from 375 to 688 the notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 25 billion at december 26 2015 our senior unsecured notes contain crossdefault provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled within 30 days after notice 

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 26 2015  included 



 

 

 

 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan’s funded status at december 26 2015 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 29 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 58 million at our 2015 measurement date 

we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2016 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2016 and beyond 

our postretirement health care plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 6 million in 2015 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 13 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 28 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table certain commitments associated with the kfc us acceleration agreement see note 4 as we cannot reliably estimate the specific timing of the remaining investments to be made in each of the next two years in connection with this agreement we anticipate investing a total of approximately 125 million through 2017 primarily to fund new backofhouse equipment for franchisees and to provide incentives to accelerate franchisee store remodels of which 72 million was invested in 2015

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu 201409 to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of the new standard asu 201409 is now effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017 the standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method the standard will not impact our recognition of revenue from companyowned restaurants or our recognition of continuing fees from franchisees or licensees which are based on a percentage of franchise and license sales we are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions such as initial fees from franchisees and refranchising of companyowned restaurants 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given 

the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future aftertax cash flows associated with the intangible asset our most significant indefinitelived intangible asset is our little sheep trademark with a book value of 56 million at december 26 2015 the fair value estimate of the little sheep trademark in our fourth quarter impairment testing exceeded its carrying value fair value was determined using a relieffromroyalty valuation approach that included estimated future revenues as a significant input and a discount rate of 13 as our estimate of the required rateofreturn that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep trademark the primary drivers of fair value include franchise revenue growth and revenues from a whollyowned business that sells seasoning to retail customers franchise revenue growth reflects annual samestore sales growth of 4 and approximately 35 new franchise units per year partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates consistent with historical results 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions and individual brands in our china and india divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from companyowned restaurant operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2015 goodwill testing date 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2015 the companys reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were kfc india taco bell us and kfc china within kfc india 86 restaurants were refranchised representing 42 of beginningofyear company units and less than 1 million in goodwill was written off representing 25 of beginningofyear goodwill within taco bell us 65 restaurants were refranchised representing 7 of beginningofyear company units and 2 million in goodwill was written off representing 2 of beginningofyear goodwill within kfc china 52 restaurants were refranchised representing 1 of beginningofyear company units and less than 1 million in goodwill was written off representing less than 1 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 18 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1134 million and a fair value of plan assets of 1004 million at december 26 2015 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 490 at december 26 2015  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 70 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 80 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2016  is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately 35 million in 2016  the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss due to lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are primarily a result of a higher discount rate at our 2015 measurement date a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2016  us pension expense by approximately 6 million 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2016  pension expense at december 26 2015  was 675 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market 

returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2016  us pension expense by approximately 10 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 675 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 10 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 138 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for these us plans at december 26 2015  we will recognize approximately 6 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2016 versus 45 million recognized in 2015 see note 13 

income taxes 

at december 26 2015 we had valuation allowances of approximately 250 million to reduce our 12 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire and us foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 26 2015 we had 98 million of unrecognized tax benefits 89 million of which are temporary in nature and if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

we have investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis we have not provided deferred tax on the portion of the excess that we believe is indefinitely reinvested as we have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence we estimate that our total temporary difference upon which we have not provided deferred tax is approximately 23 billion  at december 26 2015 a determination of the deferred tax liability on this amount is not practicable 

if our intentions regarding our ability and intent to postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence change deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we have attempted to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs on a portion of our debt through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps were entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 

at december 26 2015  and december 27 2014  a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 14 million and 5 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 26 2015  and december 27 2014  would decrease approximately 1 million and 4 million respectively as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase and the fair value of our senior 

unsecured notes at december 26 2015  and december 27 2014  would decrease approximately 119 million and 182 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency denominated debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 47 billion as of december 26 2015  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 26 2015  operating profit would have decreased approximately 155 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

narrative description of business 

general 

yum has over 41000 restaurants in more than 125 countries and territories primarily through the three concepts of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly traded companies 

the china division based in shanghai china comprises 6715 units primarily companyowned kfcs and pizza huts in 2014 the china division recorded revenues of approximately 69 billion and operating profit of 713 million on february 1 2012 we acquired a controlling interest in little sheep group limited little sheep a casual dining concept headquartered in inner mongolia china see note 4 for details the company also owns noncontrolling interests in chinese entities who operate in a manner similar to franchisees and a meat processing entity that supplies lamb to the little sheep business the kfc division comprises 14197 units operating in 115 countries outside china and india and recorded revenues of approximately 32 billion and operating profit of 708 million in 2014 the pizza hut division has 13602 units operating in 87 countries outside china and india and recorded revenues of approximately 11 billion and operating profit of 295 million in 2014 the taco bell division comprises 6199 units operating in 20 countries outside of india and recorded revenues of approximately 19 billion and operating profit of 480 million in 2014 the india division based in delhi india comprises 833 units in 2014 india recorded revenues of 141 million and an operating loss of 9 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and kfc on a more limited basis primarily in china offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty convenient and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to promote consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum by purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees contribute to the company’s revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

following is a brief description of each concept

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit restaurants from time to time to promote adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply   and distribution 

the company’s concepts including concept units operated by its franchisees are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

china division   in china we partner with approximately 600 independent suppliers mostly chinabased providing a wide range of products the company along with multiple independently owned and operated distributors utilizes approximately 20 logistic centers to distribute restaurant products to our company and franchise stores we also own a seasoning facility and a noncontrolling interest in a meat processing facility in inner mongolia both of which supply products to our little sheep business as well as thirdparty customers 

other divisions in the us the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members of restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment the core mission of rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies in the us mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores the company entered into an agreement with mclane effective january 1 2011 relating to distribution to companyowned restaurants this agreement extends through december 31 2016 and generally restricts companyowned restaurants from using alternative distributors for most products 

outside the us we and our franchisees use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors we have approximately 3000 suppliers including usbased suppliers that export to many countries 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks 

the use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in our franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business 

working capital 

information about the company’s working capital is included in mda in part ii item 7 and the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

seasonal operations 

the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree 

competition 

the retail food industry in which our concepts compete is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience location and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts competes with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees given the various types and vast number of competitors our concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales either on a worldwide or individual country basis 

research and development “rd”

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2014  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated 

government regulation

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues such as food tampering contamination or adulteration have occurred in the past and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants including restaurants operated by our concepts’ franchisees to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to litigation if a customer of our concepts becomes ill from foodborne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which would decrease our revenues in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our 

restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

our significant china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located and our revenues and profits originate in china as a consequence our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation consumer preferences taxation including income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and the regulatory environment as well as increased media scrutiny of our business and industry and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world including in china where a significant portion of our profits and revenues originate it is possible that outbreaks in china and elsewhere could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products this would likely result in lower revenues and profits avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

furthermore other viruses such as h1n1 or “swine flu” may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro as well as currencies in certain emerging markets such as the russian ruble could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers and employees the use of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyberattack or a network security incident or our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized 

persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a principal distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the us especially china and other emerging markets the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food supply and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers is limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our profit margins our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time any such increase could adversely affect our profit margins 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated by franchisees from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenues in the form of royalty payments as a result the success of our business depends in part upon the operational and financial success of our concepts’ franchisees we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and the inability of our concepts’ franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments 

if franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

our success depends substantially on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ connection to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us our franchisees or suppliers can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true any such incident could cause a decline in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts andor our products and decrease the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including weblogs blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts exposure of personally identifiable information fraud and outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort patent securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour disability and other laws we are also currently a defendant in securities and derivative lawsuits alleging inadequate disclosures in violation of federal securities laws plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 



compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial condition or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant percentage of our profit is earned outside the us and taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates historically the cash we generate outside the us has principally been used to fund our international development however if the cash generated by our us business is not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the us in the future we are required to record us income tax expense in our financial statements at the point in time when our management determines that such funds are not permanently invested outside the us this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us these reviews could include challenges of our methodologies for transfer pricing if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in such legislation regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the base erosion profit shifting project initiated by the organization for economic cooperation and development 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment disposable income and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

  

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our profit margins

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

introduction and overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements “financial statements” and the forwardlooking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a 

yum brands inc “yum” or the “company” operates franchises or licenses a worldwide system of over 41000 restaurants in more than 125 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc pizza hut or taco bell collectively the concepts brands these three concepts are the global leaders in the chicken pizza and mexicanstyle food categories respectively of the over 41000 restaurants 21 are operated by the company and 79 are operated by franchisees licensees or unconsolidated affiliates 

the company is focused on the following key growth strategies 

 

 

 

as of december 27 2014 yum consists of five operating segments 

 

prior to 2014 our reporting segments consisted of yum restaurants international yri the united states china and india in the first quarter of 2014 we changed our management reporting structure to align our global operations outside of china and india by brand as a result our yri and united states reporting segments were combined and we began reporting this information by three new reporting segments kfc division pizza hut division and taco bell division china and india remain separate reporting segments this new structure is designed to drive greater global brand focus enabling us to more effectively share knowhow and accelerate growth while our consolidated results have not been impacted we have restated our comparable segment information for consistent presentation 

our ongoing earnings growth model targets a 10 earnings per share eps growth rate which is based on our ongoing operating profit growth targets of 15 in china 10 for our kfc division 8 for our pizza hut division and 6 for our taco bell division while we believe india is a significant longterm growth driver our ongoing earnings growth model currently assumes no impact from india growth see the division discussions within the results of operations of this mda for further details of our divisional growth models 

2015 eps prior to special items is expected to grow at least 10 consistent with our ongoing targeted growth rate this includes an expected negative impact of approximately 75 million from foreign currency translation 

we intend for this mda to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations including performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following performance metrics 

 

 

 

 

 

all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements tabular amounts are displayed in millions of us dollars except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified percentages may not recompute due to rounding 

results of operations 

summary 

all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of special items all system sales growth and operating profit comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency 

2014 diluted eps increased by 4 to 309 per share as our china division which is our largest profit contributor had its sales and profits significantly impacted by adverse publicity in july surrounding improper food handling practices by a former supplier 

specifically on july 20 2014 an undercover report was televised in china depicting improper food handling practices by supplier shanghai husi a division of osi which is a large global supplier to many in the restaurant industry this triggered extensive news coverage in china that shook consumer confidence and impacted brand usage subsequently the shanghai fda sfda launched an investigation into this matter alleging illegal activity by osi upon learning of these events we terminated our relationship with osi globally with minimal disruption to our menu offerings in china even though osi was a minor supplier sales at kfc and pizza hut were disproportionately impacted given our categoryleading positions since july 21 st  china division has experienced a significant negative impact to sales and profits at both kfc and pizza hut 

prior to that incident yum experienced a strong first half of the year with china division operating profit increasing 113 and eps increasing 27 through the first two quarters of 2014 at that point the company believed it was well on its way to recovering from a 9 eps decline in 2013 which was driven by declines in kfc china sales and profits due to intense media surrounding an investigation by the sfda into our poultry supply management that began in december 2012 coupled with additional intense media in april 2013 surrounding avian flu in china 

as a result of two supplier incidents impacting kfc china sales in a relatively short period of time the recovery at kfc china has been slower than expected with samestore sales declining 18 in the fourth quarter of 2014 our pizza hut business in china which was only impacted by the 2014 supplier incident is recovering more quickly china division samestore sales and operating profit declined 5 and 8 respectively for the full year 2014 

also during 2014

unallocated refranchising gain loss 

unallocated refranchising gain loss in 2014 2013 and 2012 is discussed in note 4 

other unallocated 

in 2014 other unallocated includes higher foreign exchange losses 

in 2012 other unallocated includes a noncash gain of 74 million related to our acquisition of little sheep in 2012 

interest expense net 

the decrease in interest expense net for 2014 was driven by lapping 118 million of premiums paid and other costs related to the extinguishment of debt in 2013 the increase in 2013 versus 2012 due to this extinguishment was partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding and lower interest rates versus 2012 see note 4 

income tax provision 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 the reported effective income tax rates were 285 314 and 250 respectively see note 16 for further discussion of our income tax provision 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2049 million in 2014 versus 2139 million in 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid 

in 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was 2139 million compared to 2294 million in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower operating profit before special items and higher income taxes paid partially offset by approximately 100 million in lower pension contributions 

net cash used in investing activities was 936 million in 2014 compared to 886 million in 2013 the increase was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds partially offset by lapping the acquisition of restaurants in turkey from an existing franchisee in april 2013

net cash used in financing activities was 1114 million in 2014 compared to 1451 million in 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

in 2013 net cash used in financing activities was 1451 million compared to 1716 million in 2012 the decrease was primarily driven by lower net debt payments and lower share repurchases in 2013 partially offset by higher dividends paid on common stock and lower tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

consolidated financial condition 

the change in our goodwill and intangible assets net is primarily the result of the impairment of little sheep’s goodwill and trademark see note 4 

the changes in our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt are primarily due to the classification of 250 million in senior unsecured notes as shortterm due to their september 2015 maturity date longterm debt is also impacted by outstanding borrowings of 416 million under our revolving credit facility as of december 27 2014 see note 10 

the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is primarily the result of currency translation adjustment losses and net actuarial losses in our us pension plans see note 15 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion in each of the last thirteen fiscal years including over 2 billion in each fiscal year since 2011 we expect 

these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 

in the event our cash flows from operating activities are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 

we generate a significant amount of cash from operating activities outside the us that we have used historically to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including share repurchases dividends and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a taxefficient manner if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us businesses or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

we currently have investmentgrade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 27 2014 our interest expense would not materially increase on a fullyear basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2014 we invested 1033 million in capital spending including 525 million in china 273 million in kfc 62 million in pizza hut 143 million in taco bell and 21 million in india for 2015 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 11 billion 

during the year ended december 27 2014 we repurchased shares for 820 million on november 22 2013 our board of directors authorized share repurchases through may 2015 of up to 750 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock on november 20 2014 our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may 31 2016 of up to 1 billion excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock at december 27 2014 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to 11 billion of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under these authorizations shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

during the year ended december 27 2014 we paid cash dividends of 669 million additionally on november 20 2014 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 041 per share of common stock that were distributed on february 6 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 16 2015 the company targets an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 40 to 45 of net income 

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 13 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in march 2017 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from 23 million to 115 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 27 2014 our unused credit facility totaled 824 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 60 million and outstanding borrowings of 416 million the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 10 to 175 over the “london interbank offered rate” “libor” the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios and also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 27 2014 with a considerable amount of cushion additionally the credit facility contains crossdefault provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 125 million or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness will constitute a default under such agreement 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2015 through 2043 and stated interest rates ranging from 375 to 688 the notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 28 billion at december 27 2014 our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled within 30 days after notice 

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 27 2014  included 



 

 

 

 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred see footnote d above our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan’s funded status at december 27 2014 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 191 million the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of 57 million at our 2014 measurement date 

subsequent to december 27 2014 we contributed 75 million to the plan we do not anticipate making any additional significant contributions to the plan in 2015 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2015 and beyond 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 6 million in 2014 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 13 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 25 million of longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  asu 201408 which limits dispositions that qualify for discontinued operations presentation to those that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results strategic shifts could include a disposal of a major geographical area a major line of business a major equity method investment or other major parts of the business asu 201408 is effective prospectively for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2015 we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu 201409 to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries asu 201409 is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with no early adoption permitted the standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method the standard will not impact our recognition of revenue from companyowned restaurants or our recognition of continuing fees from franchisees or licensees which are based on a percentage of franchise and license sales we are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions such as initial fees from franchisees and refranchising of companyowned restaurants 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given 

the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets these aftertax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future aftertax cash flows associated with the intangible asset 

our most significant indefinitelived intangible asset is our little sheep trademark with a book value of 60 million at december 27 2014 we recorded impairment charges in 2014 of 284 million to write the trademark down to its estimated fair value see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 for details no additional indefinitelived intangible asset impairment was recorded in 2014 

the fair value estimate of the little sheep trademark was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the asset and was determined using a relief from royalty valuation approach that included future estimated sales as a significant input the fair value incorporated a discount rate of 13 as our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep trademark 

little sheep sales volumes and profit levels were significantly below forecasted amounts in 2014 as this continued a trend of under performance for the business a significant number of companyoperated restaurants were closed or refranchised during 2014 with future plans calling for further focus on franchiseownership for the concept as such the inputs used in determining the fair value for the little sheep trademark reflect a reduction in company ownership to a level of 50 restaurants from 92 restaurants at december 27 2014 given so few companyoperated restaurants the primary drivers of fair value in 2014 include franchise revenue growth and revenues from a whollyowned business that sells seasoning to retail customers franchise revenue growth reflects annual samestore sales growth of 4 and approximately 35 new franchise units per year partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates consistent with historical results 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our business units which are aligned based on geography in our kfc pizza hut and taco bell divisions and individual brands in our china and india divisions fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from companyowned restaurant operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

other than the little sheep reporting unit discussed below the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2014 goodwill testing date 

as a result of our annual impairment testing we completely impaired what was our most significant goodwill balance of 160 million related to our little sheep reporting unit in 2014 see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 for details the fair value of the little sheep reporting unit was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay and was determined using an income approach with future cash flow estimates generated by the business as a significant input future cash flow estimates are primarily impacted by new unit development sales growth and ownership strategy this fair value incorporated a discount rate of 13 as our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep reporting unit 

little sheep sales volumes and profit levels were significantly below forecasted amounts in 2014 as this continued a trend of under performance for the business a significant number of companyoperated restaurants were closed or refranchised during 2014 with future plans calling for further focus on franchiseownership for the concept as such the inputs used in determining the fair value for the little sheep reporting unit reflect a reduction in company ownership to a level of 50 restaurants from 92 restaurants at december 27 2014 given so few companyoperated restaurants the primary drivers of fair value in 2014 include franchise revenue growth and cash flows associated with a whollyowned business that sells seasoning to retail customers franchise revenue growth reflects annual samestore sales growth of 4 and approximately 35 new franchise units per year partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates and margins consistent with historical results 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2014 the companys most significant refranchising activity was within our china operating segment where 79 restaurants were refranchised representing approximately 2 of beginningofyear company units and less than 1 million in goodwill was written off representing approximately 1 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured workers compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 18 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1301 million and a fair value of plan assets of 991 million at december 27 2014 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 430 at december 27 2014  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased these us plans’ pbos by approximately 100 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 110 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2015  is also impacted by the discount rate as well as the longterm rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately 25 million in 2015  the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss due to higher net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income higher net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are primarily a result of a lower discount rate at our 2014 measurement date a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2015  us pension expense by approximately 13 million 

our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2015  pension expense at december 27 2014  was 675 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a 100 basis point change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2015  us pension expense by approximately 9 million additionally every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 675 will impact our unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss by approximately 9 million 

assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our us defined benefit pension plans are key estimates in measuring the expected payments which participants may receive over their lifetimes and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our us defined benefit pension plans at december 27 2014 we considered the updated mortality tables recently issued by the society of actuaries coupled with other mortality information available from the social security administration and our consulting actuaries to develop updated mortality assumptions for our participant populations the use of these updated mortality assumptions increased the benefit obligation for these us defined benefit pension plans by approximately 46 million at december 27 2014 

a decrease in discount rates has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 314 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for these us plans at december 27 2014  we will recognize approximately 45 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2015 versus 17 million recognized in 2014 see note 13 

income taxes 

at december 27 2014 we had valuation allowances of approximately 230 million to reduce our 12 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal state and foreign jurisdictions net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire and us foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 27 2014 we had 115 million of unrecognized tax benefits 17 million of which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized 

tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis totaling approximately 20 billion at december 27 2014 as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested if our intentions regarding the duration of these investments change deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we have attempted to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs on a portion of our debt through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps were entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 

at december 27 2014  and december 28 2013  a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 5 million and 3 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 27 2014  and december 28 2013  would decrease approximately 4 million and 7 million respectively as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase and the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 27 2014  and december 28 2013  would decrease approximately 182 million and 185 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency denominated debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 44 billion as of december 27 2014  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 27 2014  operating profit would have decreased approximately 150 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

narrative description of business 

general 

yum has over 40000 restaurants in more than 125 countries and territories primarily through the three concepts of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly traded companies 

the china division based in shanghai china comprises approximately 6200 system restaurants primarily companyowned kfcs and pizza huts in 2013 the china division recorded revenues of approximately 69 billion and operating profit of 777 million on february 1 2012 we acquired a controlling interest in little sheep group limited little sheep a casual dining concept headquartered in inner mongolia china see note 4 for details the company also owns noncontrolling interests in chinese entities who operate in a manner similar to kfc franchisees and a meat processing entity that supplies lamb primarily to our recently acquired little sheep business yri based in plano texas comprises approximately 15200 system restaurants primarily franchised kfcs and pizza huts operating in over 120 countries outside the us china and india in 2013 yri recorded revenues of approximately 31 billion and operating profit of 760 million we have approximately 18100 system restaurants primarily franchised restaurants in the us and recorded revenues of approximately 30 billion and operating profit of 684 million in 2013 the india division based in delhi india comprises approximately 700 system restaurants in 2013 india recorded revenues of approximately 125 million and an operating loss of 15 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and kfc on a more limited basis primarily in china offer delivery service

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants qsr traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs these manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations including food safety and quality food handling and product preparation procedures equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit conceptowned restaurants from time to time to promote adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply   and distribution 

the company’s concepts including concept units operated by its franchisees are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

china division   in china we work with approximately 650 independent suppliers mostly chinabased providing a wide range of products we own most of the distribution system which includes approximately 20 logistics centers we also own a noncontrolling interest in a meat processing facility in inner mongolia that supplies meat to our little sheep business 

us division the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members in the restaurant supply chain solutions llc “rscs formerly known as the unified foodservice purchasing coop llc which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the us the core mission of the rscs is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants in the us which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that the rscs fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores the company entered into an agreement with mclane effective january 1 2011 relating to distribution to companyowned restaurants this agreement extends through december 31 2016 and generally restricts companyowned restaurants from using alternative distributors for most products 

international and india divisions outside china and the us we and our franchisees use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors in our yri markets and india division we have approximately 3000 and 150 suppliers respectively including usbased suppliers that export to many countries 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks 

the use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in our franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues such as food tampering contamination or adulteration have occurred in the past and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants including restaurants operated by our concepts’ franchisees to instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to litigation if a customer of our concepts becomes ill from foodborne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed which would decrease our revenues in addition instances or allegations of foodborne illness or food safety issues real or perceived involving our restaurants restaurants of competitors suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our concepts’ franchisees 

our significant china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located and our revenues and profits originate in china as a consequence our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world including in china where a significant portion of our profits and revenues originate it is possible that outbreaks in china and elsewhere could reach pandemic levels public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products this would likely result in lower revenues and profits avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

furthermore other viruses such as h1n1 or “swine flu” may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro as well as currencies in certain emerging markets could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

we receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees the use of this information is regulated by applicable law as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised or our employees franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation government enforcement actions and private litigation as a result of any such failure 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations which in turn could lead to restaurant closures andor a decrease in sales in addition failure by a principal distributor for our concepts andor our concepts’ franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the us especially china and other emerging markets the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our concepts’ franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our concepts’ franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts’ franchisees’ ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food supply and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers is limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our profit margins our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time any such increase could adversely affect our profit margins 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated by franchisees from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenues in the form of royalty payments as a result the success of our business depends in part upon the operational and financial success of our concepts’ franchisees we have limited control over how our concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run and the inability of our concepts’ franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments 

if franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt it could result in financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee or a significant number of our concepts’ franchisees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

our success depends substantially on the value and perception of our brands 

our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ connection to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us our franchisees or suppliers can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true any such incident could cause a decline in consumer confidence in or the perception of our concepts andor our products and decrease the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our products which would likely result in lower revenues and profits 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including weblogs blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests andor may be inaccurate the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our concepts exposure of personally identifiable information fraud and outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a suspension of the chinese affiliates of the “big four” accounting firms may impact our ability to access capital markets and could result in other material adverse effects 

in january 2014 a us administrative law court issued an initial ruling to suspend chinese affiliates of the global “big four” accounting firms including the chinese affiliate of our independent auditor from auditing uslisted companies for six months while we believe the likelihood of the suspension becoming effective is remote it is difficult to determine the potential consequences 

if the ruling is sustained however given the significance of our china division to our consolidated financial statements it is possible that we would be unable to include audited andor reviewed consolidated financial statements in the quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k that we are required to file with the sec as a result we could be unable to file our reports in a timely manner or such filings would be considered deficient until such reviews or audits are completed our filings under the exchange act could continue to be deficient or untimely and our ability to access the capital markets could be significantly limited these issues could render us temporarily ineligible for use of both shelf registration and “shortform” registration that allows us to incorporate our prior filings by reference our inability to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company may lead the new york stock exchange to commence delisting procedures with respect to our common shares in addition the failure to deliver audited financial statements could also constitute an event of default under our credit facility moreover any negative news about the proceedings against the “big four” audit firms could erode investor confidence in financial statements relating to our chinese operations 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort patent securities derivative and other litigation see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour disability and other laws we are also currently a defendant in securities and derivative lawsuits alleging inadequate disclosures in violation of federal securities laws plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

changes in or noncompliance with governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations growth prospects or financial condition 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

 

compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations in addition the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation international expansion efforts growth prospects and financial condition or result in among other things litigation revocation of required licenses governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions 

fines and civil and criminal liability publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant percentage of our profits are earned outside the us and taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates historically the cash we generate outside the us has principally been used to fund our international development however if the cash generated by our us business is not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the us in the future we are required to record us income tax expense in our financial statements at the point in time when our management determines that such funds are not permanently invested outside the us this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide changes in such legislation regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment disposable income and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

  

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our profit margins

all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements on pages 59 through 100 tabular amounts are displayed in millions of us dollars except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified percentages may not recompute due to rounding 

description of business 

yum has over 40000 restaurants in more than 125 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc pizza hut or taco bell brands which are the global leaders in the chicken pizza and mexicanstyle food categories respectively of the over 40000 restaurants 20 are operated by the company 75 are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 5 are operated by licensees 

as of and through december 28 2013 yum’s business consists of four reporting segments yum china china or china division yum restaurants international “yri” or “international division” united states us and yum restaurants india india or india division the china division includes mainland china and the india division includes india bangladesh mauritius nepal and sri lanka yri includes the remainder of our international operations the china division yri and taco bell us represent approximately 90 of the company’s operating profits excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses 

in the first quarter of 2014 we will combine our yri and us businesses and begin reporting segment information for three global divisions kfc pizza hut and taco bell china and india will remain separate reporting segments due to their strategic importance and growth potential this new structure is designed to drive greater global brand focus enabling us to more effectively share knowhow and accelerate growth while our consolidated results will not be impacted we will restate our historical segment information during 2014 for consistent presentation 

in 2012 our india division began being reported as a standalone reporting segment separate from yri as a result of changes to our management reporting structure while our consolidated results are not impacted our historical segment information has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation 

in december of 2011 we sold our long john silvers ljs and aw all american food restaurants aw brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions the results for these businesses through the sale dates are included in the companys results for 2011 

strategies 

the company has historically focused on the following four key strategies 

build leading brands in china in every significant category – the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurant brands respectively in mainland china additionally the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage given this strong competitive position a growing economy and a population of 14 billion in mainland china the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants beginning to develop pizza hut home service home delivery and testing the additional restaurant concept of east dawning chinese food additionally on february 1 2012 we acquired an additional 66 interest in little sheep group ltd little sheep a leading casual dining concept in china this acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately 93 of the business our ongoing earnings growth model in china includes low doubledigit percentage unit growth midsingle digit samestore sales growth and moderate margin improvement which we expect to drive operating profit growth of 15 

drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere  – outside the us and china the company and its franchisees opened over 1200 new restaurants in 2013 representing 14 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants and the company is one of the leading international retail developers in terms of units opened the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india france germany russia and across africa the international division’s operating profit has experienced a 10year compound annual growth rate of approximately 12 our ongoing earnings growth model for yri includes operating profit growth of 10 driven by 34 unit growth system sales growth of 6 at least 23 samestore sales growth margin improvement and leverage of our ga infrastructure 

dramatically improve us brand positions consistency and returns  – the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience the company also strives to provide industryleading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earntherighttoown philosophy on companyowned restaurants our ongoing earnings growth model for the us calls for operating profit growth of 5 driven by samestore sales growth of at least 2 margin improvement and leverage of our ga infrastructure 

drive industryleading longterm shareholder and franchisee value  – the company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases the company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the qsr industry the company’s dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over 33 billion and 85 billion to shareholders respectively since 2004 the company targets an annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend at a doubledigit percentage rate each year since first initiating a dividend in 2004 shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

our ongoing earnings growth model including the components above is expected to generate eps growth of at least 10 annually however due primarily to poor performance in our china division the companys 2013 eps prior to special items declined 9 our 2014 eps prior to special items is expected to grow at least 20 due in large part to our expectations that china division operating profit for 2014 will grow at a rate significantly above the ongoing growth rate of 15 indicated above

in addition to the results provided in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” above and throughout this document the company has provided nongaap measurements which present operating results in 2013 2012 and 2011 on a basis before special items

the table below details items classified as special items 



 

us refranchising gain loss 

in the years ended december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 we recorded pretax refranchising gains of 91 million and 122 million respectively in the us primarily due to gains on sales of taco bell restaurants in the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded pretax losses of 17 million from refranchising in the us which were primarily the net result of gains from restaurants sold and noncash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us principally a substantial portion of our companyowned kfc restaurants refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note 4 and the store portfolio strategy section of the mda 

pension settlement charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 and continuing through 2013 the company allowed certain former employees with deferred vested balances in our us pension plans an opportunity to voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits the majority of these payouts were funded from existing pension assets 

as a result of settlement payments from the programs discussed above exceeding the sum of service and interest costs within these us pension plans in 2013 and 2012 pursuant to our accounting policy we recorded pretax settlement charges of 10 million and 84 million for the years ended december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 respectively in general and administrative expenses see note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans 

little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment 

on february 1 2012 we acquired an additional 66 interest in little sheep group limited “little sheep” for 540 million net of cash acquired of 44 million increasing our ownership to 93 the acquisition was driven by our strategy to build leading brands across china in every significant category prior to our acquisition of this additional interest our 27 interest in little sheep was accounted for under the equity method of accounting as a result of the acquisition we obtained voting control of little sheep and thus we began consolidating little sheep upon acquisition as required by gaap we remeasured our previously held 27 ownership in little sheep which had a recorded value of 107 million at the date of acquisition at fair value based on little sheeps traded share price immediately prior to our offer to purchase the business and recognized a noncash gain of 74 million this gain which resulted in no related income tax expense was recorded in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income in 2012 

under the equity method of accounting we previously reported our 27 share of the net income of little sheep as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income since the acquisition we have reported little sheeps results of operations in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting net income attributable to our partners ownership percentage is recorded in net income loss  noncontrolling interests in 2012 the consolidation of little sheep increased china division revenues by 4 decreased china restaurant margin by 04 percentage points and did not have a significant impact on china division operating profit versus 2011 

the purchase price paid for the additional 66 interest and the resulting purchase price allocation assumed samestore sales growth and new unit development for the brand as a result of consolidating little sheep the primary assets recorded in 2012 were an indefinitelived little sheep trademark and goodwill of approximately 400 million and 375 million respectively the goodwill was assigned to the newly formed little sheep reporting unit within our china division 

little sheeps sales were negatively impacted by a longer than expected purchase approval and ownership transition phase our efforts to regain sales momentum were significantly compromised in may 2013 due to negative publicity regarding quality issues with unrelated hot pot concepts in china even though there was not an issue with the quality of little sheep products 

while we remain confident in the longterm potential of little sheep the sustained declines in sales and profits that began in may 2013 and continued through the third quarter coupled with the anticipated time it will now take for the business to recover resulted in a determination during the quarter ended september 7 2013 that it was not more likely than not that the little sheep trademark and reporting unit fair values were in excess of their carrying values therefore our little sheep trademark and goodwill were tested for impairment in the quarter ended september 7 2013 prior to the annual impairment reviews performed in the fourth quarter of each year in accordance with our accounting policy 

as a result of comparing the trademark’s fair value of 345 million to its carrying value of 414 million an impairment charge of 69 million was recorded additionally after determining the fair value of the little sheep reporting unit was less than its carrying value goodwill was written down to 162 million resulting in an impairment charge of 222 million the company also evaluated other little sheep longlived assets for impairment and recorded a 4 million impairment charge related to restaurantlevel ppe 

these noncash impairment charges totalling 295 million were recorded in closures and impairment income expense on our consolidated statement of income we recorded an 18 million tax benefit associated with these impairments and allocated 19 million of the aftertax impairment charges to net income loss  noncontrolling interests which resulted in a net impairment charge of 258 million allocated to net income  yum brands inc 

losses associated with the refranchising of the pizza hut uk dinein business 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we refranchised our remaining 331 companyowned pizza hut dinein restaurants in the united kingdom uk the franchise agreement for these stores allows the franchisee to pay continuing franchise fees in the initial years of the agreement at a reduced rate we agreed to allow the franchisee to pay these reduced fees in part as consideration for their assumption of lease liabilities related to underperforming stores that we anticipate they will close that were part of the refranchising we recognize the estimated value of terms in franchise agreements entered into concurrently with a refranchising transaction that are not consistent with market terms as part of the upfront refranchising gain loss accordingly upon the closing of this refranchising in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a loss of 53 million representing the estimated value of these reduced continuing fees the associated deferred credit is being amortized into yris franchise and license fees and income through 2016 this upfront loss largely contributed to a 70 million refranchising loss we recognized in special items during 2012 net of income tax benefits of 9 million during 2011 we recorded a 76 million charge in refranchising gain loss as a result of our decision to refranchise or close all of the remaining companyowned pizza hut uk dinein restaurants primarily to write down these restaurants longlived assets to their then estimated fair value 

for the year ended december 28 2013 the refranchising of the pizza hut uk dinein restaurants decreased company sales by 18 and increased franchise and license fees and income and operating profit by 2 and 3 respectively for the yri division versus 2012 

losses and other costs relating to the ljs and aw divestitures 

in 2011 we sold the long john silvers and aw all american food restaurants brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions we recognized 86 million of losses and other costs primarily in closures and impairment income expenses as a result of our decision to sell these businesses additionally we recognized 104 million of tax benefits related to these divestitures in 2012 as compared to 2011 system sales and franchise and license fees and income in the us were negatively impacted by 5 and 6 respectively due to these divestitures while yris system sales and franchise and license fees and income were both negatively impacted by 1 while these divestitures negatively impacted both the us and yri segments operating profit by 1 in 2012 the impact on our consolidated operating profit was not significant 

other special items income expense 

in connection with the aforementioned refranchising of stores in the us we have taken several measures to transform our us business including ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs other special items income expense in 2013 includes charges relating to these us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources of 5 million as well as 2 million of costs recorded in ga that were part of the 120 million charge related to the extinguishment of debt other special items income expense in 2012 includes the depreciation reduction from the pizza hut uk and kfc us restaurants impaired upon our decision or offer to refranchise that remained company stores for some or all of the periods presented of 13 million and 3 million respectively gains from real estate sales related to our previously refranchised mexico business of 3 million and charges relating to us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources of 5 million other special items income expense in 2011 includes the depreciation reduction from the pizza hut uk and kfc us restaurants impaired upon our decision or offer to refranchise that remained company stores for some or all of the periods presented of 3 million and 10 million respectively and charges relating to us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources of 21 million 

losses related to the extinguishment of debt 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed a cash tender offer to repurchase 550 million of our senior unsecured notes due either march 2018 or november 2037 this transaction resulted in 120 million of losses as a result of premiums paid and other costs 118 million of which was classified as interest expense net in our consolidated statement of income the repurchase of the senior unsecured notes was funded primarily by proceeds of 599 million received from the issuance of new senior unsecured notes see note 10 for further discussion on the issuance of senior unsecured notes 

china poultry supply incident and avian flu 

in late december 2012 our kfc china sales began to be negatively impacted by intense media attention surrounding an investigation by the shanghai fda sfda into poultry supply management at our china division in january 2013 the sfda concluded its investigation and released its recommendations to yum china during 2013 our team in china undertook a comprehensive review of our supply chain incorporated the sfda’s recommendations and as part of our commitment to quality took additional steps to further strengthen our overall poultry supply chain practices including increased testing of product received from suppliers as a result of increased product testing and additional regulatory scrutiny instances of supplier noncompliance are identified from time to time leading to related actions by us and regulatory authorities including the termination of certain suppliers in accordance with our policies 

kfc china sales were further negatively impacted beginning in april of 2013 by the intense media surrounding avian flu in china the combined impacts of the media attention surrounding the sfda investigation and avian flu resulted in a 13 decline in china division samestore sales for the full year operating profit for 2013 declined 26 prior to foreign currency translation due primarily to sales deleverage at kfc 

as the extensive publicity in 2013 around these two events subsided kfc china’s sales began to recover and samestore sales improved in each consecutive month during china divisions fourth quarter kfc china’s fourth quarter samestore sales declined 4 compared to same store sales declines of 15 for the full year 

given the momentum of the kfc business and the continued strength of pizza hut casual dining china division 2014 operating profit is expected to return to 2012 levels of more than 1 billion 

in light of increased attention on food safety issues in china generally and on poultry supply in particular as well as recent reports of avian flu in china further reports relating to either issue could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for our china division see item ia “risk factors” on page 8 for a discussion of risks relating to food safety and avian flu 

extra week in 2011 

our fiscal calendar results in a 53 rd week every five or six years fiscal year 2011 included a 53 rd week in the fourth quarter for all our us businesses and certain of our yri businesses that report on a period as opposed to a monthly basis our china and india divisions report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53 rd week in 2011 

see the system sales growth section within our mda for further discussion on the impact of 53 rd week in 2011 on system sales the following table summarizes the estimated impact of the 53 rd  week in 2011 on revenues and operating profit 



 

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital we refranchised 214 468 and 404 company restaurants in the us in the years ended december 28 2013 december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively additionally in december 2012 we refranchised 331 remaining companyowned dinein restaurants in the pizza hut uk business 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities including amounts characterized as special items 



refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline and franchise and license expense can increase over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of ga declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga expenses that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or a portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year

internal revenue service proposed adjustments 

on june 23 2010 the company received a revenue agent report rar from the internal revenue service the irs relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries the proposed adjustment would result in approximately 700 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately 255 million for fiscal years 20042006 on january 9 2013 the company received an rar from the irs for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 as expected the irs proposed an adjustment similar to their proposal for 20042006 that would result in approximately 270 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately 40 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 furthermore the company expects the irs to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal 2008 the potential additional taxes for 2009 through 2013 computed on a similar basis to the 20042008 additional taxes would be approximately 140 million plus net interest to date of approximately 10 million 

for 2013 our effective tax rate excluding special items increased from 258 in 2012 to 280 primarily as a result of an incremental provision recorded related to this matter we believe we have properly reported our taxable income and paid taxes consistent with all applicable laws and intend to vigorously defend our position including through litigation if we are unable to settle with the irs through administrative proceedings as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position additionally if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue such increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution

interest expense net 



the increase in interest expense net for 2013 was primarily driven by 118 million of premiums paid and other costs related to the extinguishment of debt partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding and lower interest rates versus 2012 see losses related to the extinguishment of debt section of note 4 additionally interest income increased by 9 million due to recoveries of franchise notes 

the decrease in interest expense net for 2012 was primarily driven by lower average borrowings outstanding versus 2011 

income taxes 

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 



statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations this item includes local taxes withholding taxes and shareholderlevel taxes net of foreign tax credits the favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside the us where tax rates are generally lower than the us rate 

in 2012 this benefit was negatively impacted by the repatriation of current year foreign earnings to the us as we recognized additional tax expense resulting from the related effective tax rate being lower than the us federal statutory rate 

in 2011 this benefit was positively impacted by the repatriation of current year foreign earnings as we recognized excess foreign tax credits resulting from the related effective tax rate being higher than the us federal statutory rate 

adjustments to reserves and prior years this item includes 1 changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position and 2 the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets the impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations  line 

in 2013 this item was negatively impacted by the provision recorded to the continuing dispute with the irs regarding the valuation of rights to intangibles transferred to certain foreign subsidiaries see internal revenue service proposed adjustments section of note 17 

in 2012 this item was favorably impacted by the resolution of uncertain tax positions in certain foreign jurisdictions 

net benefit from ljs and aw divestitures this item includes a onetime 117 million tax benefit including approximately 8 million state benefit recognized on the ljs and aw divestitures in 2011 partially offset by 45 million of valuation allowance including approximately 4 million state expense related to capital loss carryforwards recognized as a result of the divestitures in addition we recorded 32 million of tax benefits on 86 million of pretax losses and other costs which resulted in 104 million of total net tax benefits related to the divestitures 

change in valuation allowances this item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year the impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations  line 

in 2013 23 million of net tax expense was driven by 32 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year partially offset by a 9 million net tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

in 2012 14 million of net tax expense was driven by 16 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year partially offset by a 2 million net tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

in 2011 22 million of net tax expense was driven by 15 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year and 7 million of tax expense resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year these amounts exclude 45 million in valuation allowance additions related to capital losses recognized as a result of the ljs and aw divestitures which are presented within  net benefit from ljs and aw divestitures  

other this item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings as well as us tax credits and deductions 

in 2013 this item was negatively impacted by the 222 million noncash impairment of little sheep goodwill which resulted in no related tax benefit 

in 2012 this item was positively impacted by a onetime pretax gain of 74 million with no related income tax expense recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of little sheep 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities  was 2139 million in 2013 compared to 2294 million in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower operating profit before special items and higher income taxes paid 

in 2012 net cash provided by operating activities was 2294 million compared to 2170 million in 2011 the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items partially offset by timing of cash payments for operating expenses and higher income taxes paid 

net cash used in investing activities  was 886 million in 2013 compared to 1005 million in 2012 the decrease was primarily driven by lapping the acquisition of little sheep and release of related restricted cash see little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 

in 2012 net cash used in investing activities was 1005 million compared to 1006 million in 2011 the acquisition of little sheep increased capital spending in china and the lapping of proceeds from the 2011 divestitures of ljs and aw were offset by the release of restricted cash related to the little sheep acquisition and higher proceeds from refranchising in 2012 

net cash used in financing activities  was 1451 million in 2013 compared to 1716 million in 2012 the decrease was primarily driven by lower net debt payments and lower share repurchases in 2013 partially offset by higher dividends paid on common stock and lower tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

in 2012 net cash used in financing activities was 1716 million compared to 1413 million in 2011 the increase was driven by increased share repurchases 

consolidated financial condition 

the changes in our goodwill and intangible assets net are primarily the result of the partial impairment of little sheep’s goodwill and trademark see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 

the changes in our other liabilities and deferred credits and accumulated other comprehensive income loss are primarily the result of actuarial gains in our us pension plans recognized in 2013 see note 14 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our companyowned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion in each of the last twelve fiscal years including over 2 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 

in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders as of december 28 2013 we had approximately 12 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in march 2017 

china and yri represented approximately 70 of the company’s segment operating profit in 2013 and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including share repurchases dividends and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a taxefficient manner   if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

we currently have investmentgrade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets costeffectively if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 28 2013 which included no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our interest expense would not materially increase on a fullyear basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2013 we invested 1049 million in capital spending including 568 million in china 289 million in yri 161 million in the us and 31 million in india for 2014 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 12 billion 

during the year ended december 28 2013 we repurchased shares for 750 million which excluded the effect of 20 million in shares repurchased with trade dates prior to the 2012 fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the 2012 fiscal year on november 16 2012 our board of directors authorized share repurchases through may 2014 of up to 1 billion excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock on november 22 2013 our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may 2015 of up to 750 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock at december 28 2013 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to 953 million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under these authorizations shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

during the year ended december 28 2013 we paid cash dividends of 615 million additionally on november 22 2013 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 037 per share of common stock that were distributed on february 7 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 17 2014 the company targets an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income 

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 13 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in march 2017 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from 23 million to 115 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 28 2013  our unused credit facility totaled 12 billion net of outstanding letters of credit of 65 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 28 2013  the interest rate for most borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 10 to 175 over the “london interbank offered rate” “libor” the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries this agreement contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios and also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 28 2013  with a considerable amount of cushion additionally the credit facility contains crossdefault provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 125 million or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness will constitute a default under such agreement 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2014 through 2043 and interest rates ranging from 238 to 688 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 28 billion at december 28 2013  our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled or such indebtedness is not discharged within 30 days after notice 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we issued 325 million aggregate principal amount of 388 10 year senior unsecured notes and 275 million aggregate principal amount of 535 30 year senior unsecured notes we used the proceeds from our issuances of these senior unsecured notes in part to repurchase certain of our senior unsecured notes due march 2018 and november 2037 with principal amounts of 275 million each totaling 550 million see significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results and note 10 for information on the repurchase of those senior unsecured notes 

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 28 2013  included 



 

 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 224 million of longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of the us plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from our other significant us plan are paid by the company as incurred our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan’s funded status at december 28 2013 the plan was in a net overfunded position of 10 million the uk pension plans are in a net overfunded position of 33 million at our 2013 measurement date 

based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans we currently estimate that we will not be required to make any contributions in 2014 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2014 and beyond 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 7 million in 2013 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have agreed to provide financial support if required to a variable interest entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants or the upgrade of existing restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s refranchising programs in the us we have provided guarantees of approximately 35 million in support of the franchisee loan program at december 28 2013 the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were 38 million with an additional 42 million available for lending at december 28 2013  

our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately 85 million and 60 million of debt outstanding as of december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  respectively 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in march 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu no 201305 foreign currency matters topic 830 parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity  asu 201305 to resolve a diversity in accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment of foreign currency upon derecognition of a foreign subsidiary or group of assets asu 201305 requires the parent to apply the guidance in subtopic 83030 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a reporting entity parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary 

or group of assets within a foreign entity accordingly the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided further asu 201305 clarified that the parent should apply the guidance in subtopic 81010 if there is a sale of an investment in a foreign entity including both 1 events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and 2 events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date accordingly the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events asu 201305 is effective prospectively for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2014 we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists asu 201311 to require that in certain cases an unrecognized tax benefit or portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward when such items exist in the same taxing jurisdiction asu 201311 is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2014 the amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date and retrospective application is permitted we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and a discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets including a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying value if a qualitative assessment is not performed or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value then the assets fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is an estimate 

of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future aftertax cash flows associated with the intangible asset 

our most significant indefinitelived intangible asset is our little sheep trademark we wrote down the little sheep trademark from 414 million to 345 million as a result of an impairment charge of 69 million recorded in the quarter ended september 7 2013 see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 for details no additional indefinitelived intangible asset impairment was recorded as a result of our annual testing at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

the fair value of the little sheep trademark was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the asset and was determined using a relief from royalty valuation approach that included future estimated sales as a significant input this fair value incorporated a discount rate of 13 as our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep trademark 

while future business results are difficult to predict we believe the decline in little sheep samestore sales and profit that were deemed an impairment indicator will be reversed over time and significant new unit development will take place the inputs used in determining the fair value of the little sheep trademark assumed that the business will recover to preacquisition average unit sales volumes and profit over the next three years at such preacquisition sales and profit levels we believe that the little sheep restaurantlevel unit economics will support the new unit development we assumed in the fair value estimation of the trademark longterm average growth assumptions subsequent to this assumed recovery include samestore sales growth of 4 and average annual net unit growth of approximately 75 units 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding the impairment or disposal of property plant and equipment and intangible assets 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us our yri business units which are aligned based on geography and individual brands in our india and china divisions we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value if a qualitative assessment is not performed or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then the reporting unit’s fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from companyowned restaurant operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a thirdparty buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of our fourth quarter other than the little sheep reporting unit discussed below the fair values of each of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2013 goodwill impairment testing date 

our most significant goodwill balance is attributed to our little sheep reporting unit we wrote down little sheeps goodwill from 384 million to 162 million as a result of an impairment charge of 222 million recorded in the quarter ended september 7 2013 see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 for details on this impairment no additional impairment was recorded as a result of our annual impairment review performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2013 the fair value of the little sheep reporting unit was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay and was determined using an income approach with future cash flow estimates generated by the business as a significant input future cash flow estimates are impacted by new unit development sales growth and margin improvement this fair value incorporated a discount rate of 13 as our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep reporting unit 

while future business results are difficult to predict we believe the decline in little sheep samestore sales and profits that were deemed an impairment indicator will be reversed over time and significant new unit development will take place as such the inputs used in determining the fair value of the little sheep reporting unit assumed that the business will recover to preacquisition average unit sales volumes and profit levels over the next three years at such preacquisition sales and profit levels we believe that the little sheep restaurantlevel unit economics will support the new unit development we assumed in the fair value estimation of the reporting unit longterm average growth assumptions subsequent to this assumed recovery include samestore sales growth of 4 and average annual net unit growth of approximately 75 units 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2013 the companys most significant refranchising activity was within our taco bell us operating segment where 178 restaurants were refranchised representing 17 of beginningofyear company units and 4 million in goodwill was written off representing 4 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

allowances for franchise and license receivablesguarantees 

franchise and license receivable balances include continuing fees initial fees rent and other ancillary receivables such as fees for support services our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon predefined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december 28 2013 as such we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december 28 2013 

we issue certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1 assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 2 facilitating franchisee development and 3 equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification such as franchise lease renewals when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 

the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases discounted at our pretax cost of debt is approximately 625 million at december 28 2013 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases additionally we have guaranteed approximately 40 million of franchisee loans for various programs we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under assigned leases and certain of the loan programs we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and historically we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees at december 28 2013  we have recorded an immaterial liability for our probable exposure under these guarantees if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our guarantees 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured workers compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans our two most significant plans are in the us and combined had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1025 million and a fair value of plan assets of 933 million at december 28 2013 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 54 at december 28 2013  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 70 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 79 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2014  is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately 60 million in 2014  the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss due to lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as well as lapping pension settlement charges from 2013 including settlement charges allocated to special items of 10 million lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are primarily a result of a higher discount rate at our 2013 measurement date a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2014  us pension expense by approximately 9 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets is based upon the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2014  pension expense at december 28 2013  was 69 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentagepoint change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2014  us pension expense by approximately 8 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 119 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 28 2013  for purposes of determining 2013 pension expense we recognized 48 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 17 million of such loss in 2014 

see note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans 

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model see note 15 for details of the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield used in valuing these awards additionally we estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically less than 10 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliffvest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis we have determined that 5 years and 625 years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurantlevel employees and to executives respectively 

upon each significant stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our common stock as well as implied volatility associated with our publicly traded options we have estimated prevesting forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 50 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 20 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

income taxes 

at december 28 2013 we had valuation allowances of approximately 200 million to reduce our 10 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable us federal and state and foreign jurisdictions net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions the majority of which do not expire and us foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 28 2013 we had 243 million of unrecognized tax benefits 170 million of which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis totaling approximately 26 billion at december 28 2013 as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested if our intentions regarding the duration of these investments change deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs on a portion of our debt through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 

at both december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 3 million in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  would decrease approximately 7 million and 10 million respectively as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase and the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  would decrease approximately 185 million and 225 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the combined operating profits of china yri and india constitute approximately 70 of our segment operating profit in 2013  in addition the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 42 billion as of december 28 2013  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  operating profit would have decreased approximately 155 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

general 

yum is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on number of system units with over 39000 units in more than 125 countries and territories primarily through the three concepts of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly traded companies 

the china division based in shanghai china comprises approximately 5700 system restaurants primarily companyowned kfcs and pizza huts in 2012 the china division recorded revenues of approximately 69 billion and operating profit of approximately 1 billion on february 1 2012 we acquired a controlling interest in little sheep group limited little sheep a casual dining concept headquartered in inner mongolia china see note 4 for details the company also owns noncontrolling interests in chinese entities who operate in a manner similar to kfc franchisees yri based in plano texas comprises approximately 14600 system restaurants primarily franchised kfcs and pizza huts operating in over 120 countries outside the us china and india in 2012 yri recorded revenues of approximately 33 billion and operating profit of 715 million we have approximately 18000 system restaurants primarily franchised restaurants in the us and recorded revenues of approximately 34 billion and operating profit of 666 million in 2012 the india division based in delhi india comprises approximately 600 system restaurants in 2012 india recorded revenues of approximately 100 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees contribute to the company’s revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures food safety and quality equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit conceptowned restaurants from time to time to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply   and distribution 

the company’s concepts including concept units operated by its franchisees are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials 

the company is committed to conducting its business in an ethical legal and socially responsible manner all restaurants regardless of their ownership structure or location must adhere to strict food quality and safety standards the guidelines are translated to local market requirements and regulations where appropriate and without compromising the standards the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

china division   in china we work with approximately 650 independent suppliers mostly chinabased providing a wide range of products we own most of the distribution system which includes approximately 20 logistics centers we also own a noncontrolling interest in a meat processing facility in inner mongolia that supplies meat to our little sheep business

us division the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members in the unified foodservice purchasing coop llc the “unified coop” which was created for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the us the core mission of the unified coop is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the companyowned and franchisee restaurants in the us which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that the unified coop fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in companyowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores the company entered into an agreement with mclane effective january 1 2011 relating to distribution to companyowned restaurants this agreement extends through december 31 2016 and generally restricts companyowned restaurants from using alternative distributors for most products

the use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in our franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants including restaurants operated by our franchisees to instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination could adversely affect our concepts brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits if a customer of our concepts or franchisees becomes ill from foodborne illnesses we and our franchisees may temporarily close some restaurants which would decrease our revenues in addition instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination solely involving our suppliers or distributors or solely at restaurants of competitors could adversely affect our sales as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally such instances of foodborne illness food tampering and food contamination may not be within our control the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our franchisees 

our china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

  

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located in china as a consequence our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

  

a significant portion of our concepts restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the 

regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales 

  

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the us especially china and other emerging markets the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our franchisees ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules 

expansion into target markets could also be affected by our franchisees ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants our planned growth could slow and our future revenue and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food supply and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers is limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our profit margins our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs including workers compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time any such increase could adversely affect our profit margins 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

  

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers or distributors failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations in addition failure by a principal distributor for our concepts andor our franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts franchisees 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated by franchisees from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenue in the form of royalty payments as a result the success of our business depends in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees we have limited control over how our franchisees businesses are run and the inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments 

if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt it could result in financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant franchisee or a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour disability and other laws plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

outbreaks of avian flu have occurred in the past and it is possible that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels future outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to eat less chicken which could negatively impact our profit margins sales and revenues widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

furthermore other viruses such as h1n1 or “swine flu” may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business 

our success depends substantially on the value and perception of our brands 

our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers connection to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities and even isolated business incidents can erode brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality of our products regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are accurate consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products which would likely result in lower sales and ultimately profits 

our results and financial condition could be affected by the success of our refranchising program 

  

we are in the process of refranchising restaurants in the us which has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce the percentage of company ownership of kfcs pizza huts and taco bells in the us once executed the success of the refranchising program will depend on among other things buyers effectively operating these restaurants the impact of contingent liabilities incurred in connection with refranchising and whether the resulting ownership mix of companyoperated and franchiseeoperated restaurants allows us to meet our financial objectives in addition refranchising activity could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and that volatility could impact our reported earnings 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment disposable income and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales mix profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

  

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex for example we are subject to 

 

new laws or changes in law could result in increased taxes and compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations in addition the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could increase our exposure to litigation and governmental investigations or proceedings which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our reputation and financial condition failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact the companys results of operations and financial condition 

  

a significant percentage of our profits are earned outside the us and taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates historically the cash we generate outside the us has principally been used to fund our international development however if the cash generated by our us business is not sufficient to meet the companys need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the us in the future such international earnings would be subject to us tax at the point in time we did not believe they were permanently invested outside the us this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide such changes could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

  

we receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees the use of this information by us is regulated by applicable law as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could adversely affect our reputation as well as our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

  

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our profit margins 

certain aspects of the recentlyacquired little sheep business could create additional risk 

on february 1 2012 we acquired an additional 66 interest in little sheep group limited “little sheep” increasing our ownership to 93 we have limited or no experience with certain aspects of the little sheep business including the methods of cooking involved in “hot pot” restaurants the manufacturing of soup base seasoning for store and retail use as well as the minority ownership by little sheep of a meat processing facility in inner mongolia risks related to these aspects of little sheeps business could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition

all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements on pages 57 through 97 tabular amounts are displayed in millions of us dollars except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified percentages may not recompute due to rounding 

description of business 

yum is the world’s largest quickservice restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over 39000 restaurants in more than 125 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc pizza hut or taco bell brands in december of 2011 we sold our long john silvers ljs and aw all american food restaurants aw brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions the results for these businesses through the sale dates are included in the companys results for 2011 and 2010 the company’s primary restaurant brands – kfc pizza hut and taco bell – are the global leaders in the chicken pizza and mexicanstyle food categories respectively of the over 39000 restaurants 19 are operated by the company 75 are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6 are operated by licensees 

yum’s business consists of four reporting segments yum china china or china division yum restaurants international “yri” or “international division” united states us and yum restaurants india india or india division the china division includes mainland china and the india division includes india bangladesh mauritius nepal and sri lanka yri includes the remainder of our international operations the china division yri and taco bell us now represent approximately 85 of the company’s operating profits excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses 

in 2012 our india division began being reported as a standalone reporting segment separate from yri as a result of changes to our management reporting structure while our consolidated results are not impacted our historical segment information has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation 

strategies 

the company continues to focus on four key strategies 

build leading brands in china in every significant category – the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurant brands respectively in mainland china additionally the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage given this strong competitive position a growing economy and a population of 13 billion in mainland china the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of pizza hut home service pizza delivery and east dawning chinese food additionally on february 1 2012 we acquired an additional 66 interest in little sheep group ltd little sheep a leading casual dining concept in china this acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately 93 of the business our ongoing earnings growth model in china includes doubledigit percentage unit growth midteen system sales growth midsingle digit samestore sales growth and moderate leverage of our general and administrative “ga” infrastructure which we expect to drive operating profit growth of 15 

drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere  – outside the us and china the company and its franchisees opened over 1000 new restaurants in 2012 representing 13 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants and the company is one of the leading international retail developers in terms of units opened the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india france germany russia and across africa the international division’s operating profit has experienced a 10year compound annual growth rate of 12 our ongoing earnings growth model for yri includes operating profit growth of 10 driven by 34 unit growth system sales growth of 6 at least 23 samestore sales growth margin improvement and leverage of our ga infrastructure 

dramatically improve us brand positions consistency and returns  – the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience the company also strives to provide industryleading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earntherighttoown philosophy on companyowned restaurants our ongoing earnings growth model for the us calls for operating profit growth of 5 driven by samestore sales growth of at least 2 margin improvement and leverage of our ga infrastructure 

drive industryleading longterm shareholder and franchisee value  – the company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases the company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the quick service restaurants “qsr” industry the company’s dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over 26 billion and 76 billion to shareholders respectively since 2004 the company targets an annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend at a doubledigit percentage rate each year since first initiating a dividend in 2004 shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

the ongoing earnings growth rates referenced above represent our average annual targets for the next several years   consistent with these ongoing earnings growth rates in december 2012 we indicated our expectation of at least 10 eps growth for 2013 however kfc china samestore sales turned sharply negative during the last two weeks in december as a result of adverse publicity from a poultry supply situation we have made the assumptions that it will take time to restore consumer confidence and kfc china samestore sales will improve as the year progresses and will be positive in the fourth quarter with these assumptions for the full year we estimate that china restaurant margin will be in the midteens china operating profit will be negative versus prior year and eps excluding special items will decline by a midsingle digit percentage in 2013 this includes an expectation for a significant decline in eps performance in the first half of the year followed by eps growth in the second half we expect to open at least 700 new units in china which is unchanged from our previous guidance see the china results of operations paragraph within the significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results section of this mda for further discussion of the poultry supply situations impact to the china divisions results of operations

special items 

in addition to the results provided in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” above and throughout this document the company has provided nongaap measurements which present operating results in 2012 2011 and 2010 on a basis before special items included in special items are the us refranchising gain loss the yum retirement plan settlement charge in 2012 the gain upon acquisition of little sheep in 2012 the losses associated with refranchising equity markets outside the us and the losses other costs and tax benefits in 2011 relating to our divestiture of the ljs and aw brands other special items income expense includes the depreciation reductions from pizza hut uk and kfc us restaurants impaired upon our decision or offer to refranchise that remained company stores for some or all of the periods presented gains from real estate sales related to our previously refranchised mexico business and charges relating to us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources 

the company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and special items are not included in our china yri us or india segment results this nongaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations excluding items in 2012 2011 and 2010 that the company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature 



 

us business transformation 

we took several measures in 2012 2011 and 2010 to transform our us business including refranchising and ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs 

in the year ended december 29 2012 we recorded pretax refranchising gains of 122 million in the us primarily due to gains on sales of taco bells in the years ended december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 we recorded pretax losses of 17 million and 18 million from refranchising in the us respectively the losses recorded in the years ended december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 were primarily the net result of gains from restaurants sold and noncash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us principally a substantial portion of our companyoperated kfc restaurants the noncash impairment charges that we recorded related to our offers to refranchise these companyoperated kfc restaurants in the us decreased depreciation expense versus what we would have otherwise recorded by 3 million 10 million and 9 million in the 

years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item resulting in depreciation expense in the us segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants this depreciation reduction is classified within other special items income expense in the table above refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note 4 and the store portfolio strategy section of the mda 

in connection with our ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs we recorded pretax charges of 5 million 21 million and 9 million in the years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively these charges are classified within other special items in the above table 

yum retirement plan settlement charge 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company allowed certain former employees with deferred vested balances in the yum retirement plan the plan an opportunity to voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits we paid out 227 million all of which was funded from existing pension plan assets 

as a result of settlement payments exceeding the sum of service and interest costs within the plan in 2012 pursuant to our policy we recorded a pretax settlement charge of 84 million in general and administrative expenses see note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans 

little sheep acquisition 

on february 1 2012 we acquired an additional 66 interest in little sheep for 540 million net of cash acquired of 44 million increasing our ownership to 93 the acquisition was driven by our strategy to build leading brands across china in every significant category prior to our acquisition of this additional interest our 27 interest in little sheep was accounted for under the equity method of accounting as a result of the acquisition we obtained voting control of little sheep and thus we began consolidating little sheep upon acquisition as required by gaap we remeasured our previously held 27 ownership in the entity which had a recorded value of 107 million at the date of acquisition at fair value based on little sheeps traded share price immediately prior to our offer and recognized a noncash gain of 74 million which resulted in no related income tax expense 

under the equity method of accounting we previously reported our 27 share of the net income of little sheep as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income since the acquisition we have reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting net income attributable to our partners ownership percentage is recorded as net income  noncontrolling interest in 2012 the consolidation of little sheep increased china division revenues by 4 decreased china division restaurant margin by 04 percentage points and did not have a significant impact on china division operating profit 

refranchising of equity markets outside the us 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we refranchised our remaining 331 companyowned pizza hut dinein restaurants in the united kingdom the newly signed franchise agreement for these stores allows the franchisee to pay continuing franchise fees in the initial years of the agreement at a reduced rate we agreed to allow the franchisee to pay these reduced fees in part as consideration for their assumption of lease liabilities related to underperforming stores that we anticipate they will close that were part of the refranchising we recognize the estimated value of terms in franchise agreements entered into concurrently with a refranchising transaction that are not consistent with market terms as part of the upfront refranchising gain loss accordingly upon the closing of this refranchising we recognized a loss of 53 million representing the estimated value of these reduced continuing fees the associated deferred credit is recorded within other liabilities and deferred credits in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012 and will be amortized into yris franchise and license fees and income over the next four years including 16 million in 2013 this upfront loss largely contributed to a 70 million refranchising loss we recognized in special items during 2012 as a result of this refranchising also included in that loss was the writeoff of 14 million in goodwill allocated to the pizza hut uk reporting unit the remaining carrying value of goodwill allocated to our pizza hut uk business of 87 million after the aforementioned writeoff was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the pizza hut uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount an income tax benefit of 9 million was recorded in special items in 2012 as a result of this 70 million refranchising loss 

during 2011 we recorded a 76 million charge in refranchising gain loss as a result of our decision to refranchise or close all of our remaining companyowned pizza hut uk dinein restaurants primarily to write down these restaurants longlived assets to their then estimated fair value impairment charges of pizza hut uk longlived assets incurred as a result of this decision including the charge mentioned in the previous sentence reduced depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been 

recorded by 13 million and 3 million for the years ended december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively the depreciation reduction is classified within other special items income expense in the table above 

in 2010 we recorded a 52 million loss on the refranchising of our mexico equity market as we sold all of our companyowned restaurants comprised of 222 kfc and 123 pizza huts to an existing latin american franchise partner the buyer is also serving as the master franchisee for mexico which had 102 kfc and 53 pizza hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction the writeoff of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our mexico reporting unit included an insignificant amount of goodwill this loss did not result in a related income tax benefit in 2012 within other special items income expense we recorded gains of 3 million from real estate sales related to our previously refranchised business 

in 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining companyowned restaurants in taiwan which consisted of 124 kfcs we included in our december 25 2010 financial statements a writeoff of 7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of taiwan this loss did not result in a related income tax benefit we believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the taiwan refranchising were substantially consistent with market the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our taiwan business of 30 million was determined not to be impaired subsequent to the refranchising as the fair value of the taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 

the amount of goodwill writeoff for the pizza hut uk and taiwan reporting units was based on the relative fair values of the businesses disposed of and the portion of the businesses that were retained the fair value of the businesses disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the company associated with the franchise agreements entered into in connection with these refranchising transactions the fair value retained by the company includes future royalties to be received from the refranchised businesses for pizza hut uk the fair value retained also includes the anticipated future cash flows from our pizza hut uk delivery business which is part of the pizza hut uk reporting unit and was not impacted by the dinein refranchising 

ljs and aw divestitures 

in 2011 we sold the long john silvers and aw all american food restaurants brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions in 2011 we recognized 86 million of pretax losses and other costs primarily in closures and impairment income expenses as a result of our decision to sell these businesses additionally we recognized 104 million of tax benefits related to these divestitures in 2012 system sales and franchise and license fees and income in the us were negatively impacted by 5 and 6 respectively due to these divestitures while yris system sales and franchise and license fees and income were both negatively impacted by 1 while these divestitures negatively impacted both the us and yri segments operating profit by 1 in 2012 the impact on our consolidated operating profit was not significant 

china results of operations 

china division samestore sales declined 6 in the fourth quarter of 2012 kfc china sales in the last two weeks of the year were significantly impacted by the intense media attention surrounding an investigation by the shanghai fda sfda into poultry supply management at our china division the investigation was prompted by a report broadcast on chinas national television which showed that a few poultry farmers were ignoring laws and regulations by using excessive levels of antibiotics in chicken some of this chicken was purchased by two poultry suppliers of kfc china on january 25 2013 the sfda concluded its investigation and released its recommendations to yum china to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices including refined voluntary self testing procedures improved reporting and communications and enhanced supplier management our team in china has taken a comprehensive review of our current system and is in the process of incorporating all of the sfdas recommendations 

january 2013 estimated samestore sales declined 37 for the china division including a 41 decline at kfc china we estimate that the timing of chinese new year had a negative midteen impact on the china divisions january samestore sales growth and we expect the negative impact of chinese new year to reverse in february resulting in a decline of approximately 25 for january and february combined chinas first quarter see the strategies section of this mda for a discussion of the expected impact of this situation on china divisions results of operations for the full year 2013 and on yums 2013 eps growth 

extra week in 2011 

our fiscal calendar results in a 53 rd week every five or six years fiscal year 2011 included a 53 rd week in the fourth quarter for all our us businesses and certain of our yri businesses that report on a period as opposed to a monthly basis our china and india divisions report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53 rd week in 2011 

see the system sales growth section within our mda for further discussion on the impact of 53 rd week in 2011 on system sales the following table summarizes the estimated impact of the 53 rd  week in 2011 on revenues and operating profit 



 

yri acquisitions 

in 2011 yri acquired 68 kfc restaurants from an existing franchisee in south africa for 71 million 

in 2010 we completed the exercise of our option with our russian partner to purchase their interest in the cobranded rostik’skfc restaurants across russia and the commonwealth of independent states as a result we acquired company ownership of 50 restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of 81 restaurants which our partner previously managed as master franchisee we paid cash of 60 million net of settlement of a longterm note receivable of 11 million and assumed longterm debt of 10 million which was subsequently repaid of the remaining balance of the purchase price of 12 million  a payment of 9 million  was made in july 2012 and the remainder is expected to be paid in cash during 2013 

the impact of consolidating these businesses on all lineitems within our consolidated statement of income was insignificant to the comparison of our yearoveryear results and is not expected to materially impact our results going forward 

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital in the us we are targeting company ownership of kfc pizza hut and taco bell restaurants of about 10 down from its current level of 11 with our primary remaining focus being refranchising at taco bell to about 16 company ownership from its current level of 20 consistent with this strategy 468 404 and 404 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively additionally in december 2012 we refranchised 331 remaining companyowned dinein restaurants in the pizza hut uk business and during 2010 we refranchised all companyowned kfcs and pizza huts in mexico 345 restaurants and kfcs in taiwan 124 restaurants 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities 



refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline and franchise and license expense can increase over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of ga declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or a portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit and ga expenses and b the increase in franchise fees and expenses from the restaurants that have been refranchised the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year in these tables decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of company sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year increased franchise and license fees and income represents the franchise and license fees and rent income from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year increased franchise and license expenses represent primarily rent and depreciation where we continue to own or lease the underlying property for the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year 

the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on total revenues as described above

internal revenue service proposed adjustments 

on june 23 2010 the company received a revenue agent report rar from the internal revenue service the “irs” relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries the proposed adjustment would result in approximately 700 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately 220 million for fiscal years 20042006 on january 9 2013 the company received an rar from the irs for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 as expected the irs proposed an adjustment similar to their proposal for 20042006 that would result in approximately 270 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately 30 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 furthermore the company expects the irs to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal 2008 the potential additional taxes for 2009 through 2012 computed on a similar basis to the 20042008 additional taxes would be approximately 130 million plus net interest to date of approximately 5 million 

we believe that the company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustments are inconsistent with applicable income tax laws treasury regulations and relevant case law we intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the irs as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain the company will continue to provide for its position in accordance with gaap there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position additionally if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue such increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution 

china value added tax regulation 

a tax regulation was issued in november 2011 in china which addresses the imposition of a value added tax on certain food sales where the food is not consumed on the premises where sold the applicability of the regulation if any to the sales under certain of our restaurant distribution methods is unclear at this time while we do not anticipate that the regulation will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows we currently cannot quantify the potential impact if any until we have further clarity as to its applicability 

restaurant unit activity 











 

 

 

multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count similarly a new multibrand restaurant while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands results in just one additional unit count

income taxes 

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 



statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations this item includes local taxes withholding taxes and shareholderlevel taxes net of foreign tax credits the favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the us where tax rates are generally lower than the us rate 

in 2012 this benefit was negatively impacted by the repatriation of current year foreign earnings to the us as we recognized additional tax expense resulting from the related effective tax rate being lower than the us federal statutory rate 

in 2011 and 2010 this benefit was positively impacted by the repatriation of current year foreign earnings as we recognized excess foreign tax credits resulting from the related effective tax rate being higher than the us federal statutory rate 

adjustments to reserves and prior years this item includes 1 changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position and 2 the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets the impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations  line 

in 2012 this item was favorably impacted by the resolution of uncertain tax positions in certain foreign jurisdictions 

net benefit from ljs and aw divestitures this item includes a onetime 117 million tax benefit including approximately 8 million state benefit recognized on the ljs and aw divestitures in 2011 partially offset by 45 million of valuation allowance including approximately 4 million state expense related to capital loss carryforwards recognized as a result of the divestitures in addition we recorded 32 million of tax benefits on 86 million of pretax losses and other costs which resulted in 104 million of total net tax benefits related to the divestitures 

change in valuation allowances this item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year the impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations  line 

in 2012 14 million of net tax expense was driven by 16 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year partially offset by a 2 million net tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

in 2011 22 million of net tax expense was driven by 15 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year and 7 million of tax expense resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year these amounts exclude 45 million in valuation allowance additions related to capital losses recognized as a result of the ljs and aw divestitures which are presented within net benefit from ljs and aw divestitures  

in 2010 the 22 million of net tax expense was driven by 25 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year this expense was partially offset by a 3 million tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

other this item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings as well as us tax credits and deductions 

in 2012 this item was positively impacted by a onetime pretax gain of 74 million with no related income tax expense recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of little sheep 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities  was 2294 million compared to 2170 million in 2011 the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items partially offset by timing of cash payments for operating expenses and higher income taxes paid 

in 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was 2170 million compared to 1968 million in 2010 the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items 

net cash used in investing activities  was 1005 million versus 1006 million in 2011 the acquisition of little sheep increased capital spending in china and the lapping of proceeds from the 2011 divestitures of ljs and aw were offset by the release of restricted cash related to the little sheep acquisition and higher proceeds from refranchising in 2012 

in 2011 net cash used in investing activities was 1006 million versus 579 million in 2010 the increase was driven by an increase in restricted cash and higher capital spending 

net cash used in financing activities  was 1716 million versus 1413 million in 2011 the increase was driven by increased share repurchases 

in 2011 net cash used in financing activities was 1413 million versus 337 million in 2010 the increase was driven by lower net borrowings and an increase in share repurchases 

consolidated financial condition 

the changes in our goodwill intangible assets net restricted cash other liabilities and deferred credits investments in unconsolidated affiliates and redeemable noncontrolling interest are primarily the result of the little sheep acquisition and related purchase price allocation see note 4 

the decrease in shortterm borrowings was primarily due to the maturity of 263 million of senior unsecured notes in july 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion in each of the last eleven fiscal years including over 2 billion in both 2012 and 2011 we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 

in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders as of december 29 2012 we had approximately 12 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in november 2017 

china and yri represented more than 70 of the company’s segment operating profit in 2012 and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including share repurchases dividends and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a taxefficient manner   if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

we currently have investmentgrade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets costeffectively if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 29 2012 which included no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our interest expense would not materially increase on a fullyear basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2012 we invested 1099 million in capital spending including 655 million in china 251 million in yri 175 million in the us and 18 million in india for 2013 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 11 billion 

during the year ended december 29 2012 we repurchased shares for 985 million which includes the effect of 20 million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the 2012 fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the 2012 fiscal year on november 18 2011 our board of directors authorized share repurchases through may 2013 of up to 750 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock and on november 16 2012 our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may 2014 of up to 1 billion excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock at december 29 2012 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to 953 million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the 2012 authorization shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

during the year ended december 29 2012 we paid cash dividends of 544 million additionally on november 16 2012 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 0335 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 1 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 11 2013 the company targets an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income 

on february 1 2012 we acquired a controlling interest in little sheep group limited little sheep a casual dining concept headquartered in inner mongolia china for 540 million net of 44 million cash assumed see note 4 for details 

borrowing capacity 

on march 22 2012 the company executed a fiveyear syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” totaling 13 billion which replaced a syndicated senior unsecured revolving domestic credit facility in the amount of 115 billion and a syndicated revolving international credit facility of 350 million that were both set to expire in november of 2012 the credit facility includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from 23 million to 115 million and expires on march 31 2017 we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 29 2012  our unused credit facility totaled 12 billion net of outstanding 

letters of credit of 63 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 29 2012  the interest rate for most borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 100 to 175 over the “london interbank offered rate” “libor” the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries this agreement contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios and also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 29 2012  with a considerable amount of cushion additionally the credit facility contains crossdefault provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 125 million or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness will constitute a default under such agreement 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2014 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 238 to 688 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 28 billion at december 29 2012  our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled or such indebtedness is not discharged within 30 days after notice 

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 29 2012  included 



 

 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 292 million of longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities are presented net of potential payments that would be refunded in a future year and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of these plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan’s funded status at december 29 2012 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 200 million the uk pension plans are in a net overfunded position of 33 million at our 2012 measurement date 

based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans we currently estimate that we will not be required to make any contributions in 2013 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2013 and beyond 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 5 million in 2012 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have agreed to provide financial support if required to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s historical refranchising programs we have provided guarantees of approximately 37 million in support of the franchisee loan program at december 29 2012 the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were 53 million with an additional 27 million available for lending at december 29 2012  

our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately 60 million and 75 million of debt outstanding as of december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 20132 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 20132 that requires an organization to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period asu 20132 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2012 the company currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this standard 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future 

royalties a franchisee would pay and discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay for the group of restaurants historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets including a deduction for the anticipated future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

at december 29 2012 we had indefinitelived intangible assets of 440 million 409 million of which was attributable to the little sheep trademark we acquired in 2012 we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying value if a qualitative assessment is not performed or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value then the assets fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future aftertax cash flows associated with the intangible asset we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter and no impairment was recorded 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding the impairment or disposal of property plant and equipment and intangible assets 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us our yri business units which are aligned based on geography our india division and our china division brands we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value if a qualitative assessment is not performed or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then the reporting unit’s fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of our fourth quarter as of that date our most significant goodwill balance was attributed to our little sheep reporting unit in the amount of 376 million this goodwill was recorded upon our 2012 acquisition of the little sheep business largely due to the value we expect to generate from applying yums processes and knowledge in china to expand the concept the fair values of each of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2012 goodwill impairment testing date 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2012 the companys reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our taco bell us and kfc us operating segments and our pizza hut united kingdom “uk” business unit within our taco bell us operating segment 181 restaurants were refranchised representing 15 of beginningofyear company units and 6 million in goodwill was written off representing 5 of beginningofyear goodwill within our kfc us operating segment 218 restaurants were refranchised representing 47 of beginningofyear company units and 7 million in goodwill was written off representing 5 of beginningofyear goodwill within our pizza hut uk business unit 359 dinein and delivery restaurants were refranchised representing 86 of beginningofyear company units and 16 million in goodwill was written off representing 16 of beginningofyear goodwill see note 4 for a further discussion of our refranchising of pizza hut uk 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

allowances for franchise and license receivablesguarantees 

franchise and license receivable balances include continuing fees initial fees and other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon predefined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december 29 2012 as such we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december 29 2012 

we issue certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1 assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 2 facilitating franchisee development and 3 equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification such as franchise lease renewals when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 

the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases discounted at our pretax cost of debt is approximately 675 million at december 29 2012 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases additionally we have guaranteed approximately 54 million of franchisee loans for various programs we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under assigned leases and certain of the loan programs we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and historically we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees at december 29 2012  we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our guarantees 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured workers compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the underfunded status of 345 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1290 million and a fair value of plan assets of 945 million at december 29 2012  

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 440 at december 29 2012  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s or sp with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plan we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s or sp for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moodys and sp and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 93 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbos by approximately 105 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2013  is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately 8 million in 2013  the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss due to lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2013  us pension expense by approximately 13 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2013  pension expense at december 29 2012  was 725 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentagepoint change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2013  us pension expense by approximately 8 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time along with actual asset returns below expected returns have largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 421 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 29 2012  for purposes of determining 2012 pension expense our funded status was such that we recognized 63 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 58 million of such loss in 2013 

see note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans 

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 15 additionally we estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining 

compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically approximately 10  15 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliffvest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurantlevel employees and to executives respectively 

upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options we have estimated prevesting forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 50 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 20 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

income taxes 

at december 29 2012 we had valuation allowances of 358 million to reduce our 12 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in currently profitable us federal and state and foreign jurisdictions as well as us federal and state capital loss and tax credit carryovers that may be carried forward generally for five and ten years respectively the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 29 2012 we had 309 million of unrecognized tax benefits 184 million of which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis totaling approximately 26 billion at december 29 2012 as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested if our intentions regarding the duration of these investments change deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 

at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 3 million and 5 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  would decrease approximately 10 million and 16 million respectively as a result of the same hypothetical 100 basispoint increase and the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  would decrease approximately 225 million and 228 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the combined operating profits of china yri and india constitute more than 70 of our segment operating profit in 2012  excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 42 billion as of december 29 2012  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012  operating profit would have decreased approximately 190 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise programs of the company are designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu usually lower sales volumes and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations train stations subways convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures food safety and quality equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit conceptowned restaurants from time to time to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply   and distribution 

the company’s concepts including concept units operated by its franchisees are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products paper and packaging materials 

the company is committed to conducting its business in an ethical legal and socially responsible manner all restaurants regardless of their ownership structure or location must adhere to strict food quality and safety standards the guidelines are translated to local market requirements and regulations where appropriate and without compromising the standards the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

china division   in china we work with approximately 500 independent suppliers mostly chinabased providing a wide range of products we own most of the distribution system which includes approximately 20 logistics centers 

international division throughout yri we and our franchisees use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors in our yri markets we have approximately 1500 suppliers including usbased suppliers that export to many countries 

us division the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchisee groups are members in the unified foodservice purchasing coop llc the “unified coop” which was created for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the us the core mission of the unified coop is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the conceptowned and franchisee restaurants in the us which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that the unified coop has resulted and should continue to result in closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by thirdparty distribution companies mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in conceptowned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores the company entered into an agreement with mclane effective january 1 2011 relating to distribution to conceptowned restaurants this agreement extends through december 31 2016 and generally restricts conceptowned restaurants from using alternative distributors for most products

the use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in our franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants including restaurants operated by our franchisees to instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits if a customer of our concepts or franchisees becomes ill from foodborne illnesses we and our franchisees may temporarily close some restaurants which would decrease our revenues in addition instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination solely involving our suppliers or distributors or solely at restaurants of competitors could adversely affect our sales as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally such instances of foodborne illness food tampering and food contamination may not be within our control the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our franchisees 

our china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

  

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located in china as a consequence our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

our other foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

  

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in foreign countries and territories outside of the us and china and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by country include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including consumer spending unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation the regulatory environment income and nonincome based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales 

  

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the united states especially china and other emerging markets the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules 

our franchisees also frequently depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants our planned growth could slow and our future revenue and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby it is not our intention to open new restaurants that materially cannibalize the sales of our existing restaurants however as with most growing retail and restaurant operations there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food supply and energy costs could adversely affect our operating results because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers is limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our profit margins our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time any such increase could adversely affect our profit margins 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

  

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit political instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and distributors are located the financial instability of suppliers and distributors suppliers or distributors failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations in addition failure by a principal distributor for our concepts andor our franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant portion of our revenue consists of royalties from our franchisees because a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are run by franchisees the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees while our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines we have limited control over how our franchisees’ businesses are run and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments for example franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us 

if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt it could result in financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

our results and financial condition could be affected by the success of our refranchising program 

  

we are in the process of refranchising restaurants in the us which could reduce the percentage of company ownership of kfcs pizza huts and taco bells in the us from approximately 13 at the end of 2011 to approximately 8 our ability to execute this plan will depend on among other things whether we receive fair offers for these restaurants whether we can find suitable buyers and how quickly we can consummate the sales in addition financing for restaurant purchases can be expensive or difficult to obtain if buyers cannot obtain financing at attractive prices – or if they are unable to obtain financing at any price – our refranchising program could be delayed 

once executed the success of the refranchising program will depend on among other things buyers effectively operating these restaurants the impact of contingent liabilities incurred in connection with refranchising and whether the resulting ownership mix of companyoperated and franchiseeoperated restaurants allows us to meet our financial objectives in addition refranchising activity could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and that volatility could impact our reported earnings 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour and other laws plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels future outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to eat less chicken widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

furthermore other viruses such as h1n1 or “swine flu” may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may affect our business 

our success depends substantially on the value and perception of our brands 

our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ connection to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities and even isolated business incidents can erode brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality of our products regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are accurate consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products which would likely result in lower sales and ultimately profits 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment disposable income and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales mix profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the impact of potentially limited credit availability on thirdparty vendors such as our suppliers cannot be predicted the inability of our suppliers to access financing or the insolvency of suppliers could lead to disruptions in our supply chain which could adversely impact our sales cost of sales and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

  

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world our restaurants are subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food workplace safety fire and other agencies in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly complex federal and state immigration laws and regulations in the us 

we are also subject to the americans with disabilities act in the us and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations in the us are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could lead to litigation which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

we also face risks from new or changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor in addition we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we are also subject to increasing environmental regulations which could result in increased taxation or future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies transportation and utilities any of which could decrease our operating profits andor necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations could be costly and could increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact the companys results of operations and financial condition 

  

a significant percentage of our profits are earned outside the us and taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates historically the cash we generate outside the us has principally been used to fund our international development however if the cash generated by our us business is not sufficient to meet the companys need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the us in the future such international earnings would be subject to us tax at the point in time we did not believe they were permanently invested outside the us this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide such changes could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

  

we receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees the use of this information by us is regulated by applicable law as well as by certain thirdparty contracts if our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could adversely affect our reputation as well as our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance 

  

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

  

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development price advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our profit margins

us business transformation 

the us business transformation measures in 2011 2010 and 2009 included continuation of our us refranchising ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs a reduced emphasis on multibranding as a longterm growth strategy and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases 

in the years ended december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 we recorded pretax losses of 17 million and 18 million from refranchising in the us respectively in the year ended december 26 2009 we recorded a pretax refranchising gain of 34 million in the us the losses recorded in the years ended december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 are primarily the net result of gains from restaurants sold and noncash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us principally a substantial portion of our companyoperated kfc restaurants the noncash impairment charges that we recorded related to our offers to refranchise these companyoperated kfc restaurants in the us decreased depreciation expense versus what we would have otherwise recorded by 10 million and 9 million in the years ended december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item resulting in depreciation expense in the us segment 

results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note 4 and the store portfolio strategy section of the mda 

in connection with our ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs we recorded pretax charges of 21 million 9 million and 16 million in the years ended december 31 2011 december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 respectively 

as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs and aw us businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multibranding we recorded a noncash charge of 26 million which resulted in no related income tax benefit in closures and impairment expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 to writeoff goodwill associated with our ljs and aw us businesses we owned at the time 

additionally the company recognized a reduction to franchise and license fees and income of 32 million pretax in the year ended december 26 2009 related to investments in our us brands these investments reflected our reimbursements to kfc franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of kentucky grilled chicken the reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship 

ljs and aw divestitures 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we sold the long john silvers and aw all american food restaurants brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions 

we recognized 86 million of pretax losses and other costs primarily in closures and impairment income expenses during 2011 as a result of these transactions additionally we recognized 104 million of tax benefits related to tax losses associated with the transactions 

in 2011 these businesses contributed 5 to both system sales and franchise and license fees and income for the us segment and 1 to both system sales and franchise and license fees and income for the yri segment while these businesses contributed 1 to both the us and yri segments operating profit in 2011 the impact on our consolidated operating profit was not significant 

refranchising of equity markets outside the us 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we decided to refranchise or close all of our remaining companyoperated pizza hut restaurants in the uk market while an asset group comprising approximately 350 dinein restaurants did not meet the criteria for heldforsale classification as of december 31 2011 our decision to sell was considered an impairment indicator as such we reviewed this asset group for potential impairment and determined that its carrying value was not recoverable based upon our estimate of expected refranchising proceeds and holding period cash flows anticipated while we continue to operate the restaurants as company units accordingly we wrote this asset group down to our estimate of its fair value which is based on the sales price we would expect to receive from a buyer this fair value determination considered current market conditions trends in the pizza hut uk business and prices for similar transactions in the restaurant industry and resulted in a pretax noncash writedown of 74 million which was recorded to refranchising gain loss this impairment charge decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by approximately 3 million in 2011 this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item resulting in depreciation expense in the yri segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants we will continue to review the asset group for any further necessary impairment until the date it is sold the writedown does not include any allocation of the pizza hut uk reporting unit goodwill in the asset group carrying value this additional noncash writedown would be recorded consistent with our historical policy if the asset group ultimately meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale upon the ultimate sale of the restaurants depending on the form of the transaction we could also be required to record a charge for the fair value of any guarantee of future lease payments for any leases we assign to a franchisee and for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment associated with pizza hut uk the decision to refranchise or close all remaining pizza hut restaurants in the uk was considered to be a goodwill impairment indicator we determined that the fair value of our pizza hut uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and as such there was no impairment of the approximately 100 million in goodwill attributable to this reporting unit we also recorded a 2 million loss in refranchising gain loss for obligations that we believe are probable related to the proposed refranchising of pizza hut uk 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 52 million loss on the refranchising of our mexico equity market as we sold all of our companyoperated restaurants comprised of 222 kfc and 123 pizza huts to an existing latin american franchise partner the buyer is also serving as the master franchisee for mexico which had 102 kfcs and 53 pizza hut franchise restaurants at the time 

of the transaction the writeoff of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our mexico reporting unit included an insignificant amount of goodwill this loss did not result in a related income tax benefit 

during the year ended december 26 2009 we recognized a noncash 10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our kfc taiwan equity market during the year ended december 25 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in taiwan which consisted of 124 kfcs we included in our december 25 2010 financial statements a noncash writeoff of 7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of taiwan neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit the amount of goodwill writeoff was based on the relative fair values of the taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained the fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee which included a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee was estimated to pay the company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction the fair value of the taiwan business retained consisted of expected net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction we believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the taiwan refranchising were substantially consistent with market the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our taiwan business of 30 million was determined not to be impaired subsequent to the refranchising as the fair value of the taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 

consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in shanghai china 

on may 4 2009 we acquired an additional 7 ownership in the entity that operates more than 200 kfcs in shanghai china for 12 million increasing our ownership to 58 prior to our acquisition of this additional interest this entity was accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition as required by gaap we remeasured our previously held 51 ownership in the entity which had a recorded value of 17 million at the date of acquisition at fair value and recognized a gain of 68 million accordingly this gain which resulted in no related income tax expense was recorded in other income expense in our 2009 consolidated statement of income 

under the equity method of accounting we previously reported our 51 share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the restaurants owned by the unconsolidated affiliate subsequent to the date of the acquisition we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statements of income we no longer recorded franchise fee income for these restaurants nor did we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting net income attributable to our partner’s ownership percentage is recorded in net income – noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 25 2010 the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased company sales by 98 million  decreased franchise and license fees and income by 6 million  and increased operating profit by 3 million  versus the year ended december 26 2009  the impact of the acquisition on net income – yum brands inc was not significant to the year ended december 25 2010 

extra week in 2011 

our fiscal calendar results in a 53 rd week every five or six years fiscal year 2011 included a 53 rd week in the fourth quarter for all our us businesses and certain of our yri businesses that report on a period as opposed to a monthly basis our china division reports on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53 rd week 

see the system sales growth section within our mda for further discussion on the impact of 53rd week on system sales the following table summarizes the estimated impact of the 53 rd  week on revenues and operating profit 



 

acquisition of controlling interest in little sheep   

on february 1 2012 we paid 584 million to acquire an additional 66 interest in little sheep a leading chinese casual dining concept with approximately 450 systemwide restaurants headquartered in inner mongolia china this acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately 93 of the business we expect that the consolidation of little sheep will increase our revenue in china in 2012 by approximately 5 with only a corresponding modest impact to operating profit given the transaction and transition related costs we expect to incur in our initial year of ownership 

yri acquisitions 

on october 31 2011 yri acquired 68 kfc restaurants from an existing franchisee in south africa for 71 million 

on july 1 2010 we completed the exercise of our option with our russian partner to purchase their interest in the cobranded rostik’skfc restaurants across russia and the commonwealth of independent states as a result we acquired company ownership of 50 restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of 81 restaurants which our partner previously managed as master franchisee we paid cash of 60 million net of settlement of a longterm note receivable of 11 million and assumed longterm debt of 10 million which was subsequently repaid the remaining balance of the purchase price of 12 million will be paid in cash by july 2012 

the impact of consolidating these businesses on all lineitems within our consolidated statement of income was insignificant to the comparison of our yearoveryear results and is not expected to materially impact our results going forward 

pizza hut south korea goodwill impairment 

as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our pizza hut south korea business we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 12 million for this market during 2009 this charge was recorded in closure and impairment income expenses in our consolidated statement of income and was allocated to our international division for performance reporting purposes 

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital in the us we are targeting company ownership of kfc pizza hut and taco bell restaurants of about 8 down from its current level of 13 with our primary remaining focus being refranchising at kfc and taco bell to about 5 and 16 company ownership respectively consistent with this strategy 404 404 and 541 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december 31 2011 december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 respectively at december 31 2011 we have offered for refranchising approximately 250 kfcs in the us additionally we have offered for refranchise all remaining companyowned restaurants in the pizza hut uk business approximately 420 restaurants remaining as of december 31 2011 and during 2010 we refranchised all companyowned kfcs and pizza huts in mexico 345 restaurants and kfcs in taiwan 124 restaurants 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities 



refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of ga declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or a portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and ga expenses and b the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year in these tables decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year increased franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year

internal revenue service proposed adjustment 

on june 23 2010 the company received a revenue agent report from the internal revenue service the “irs” relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries the proposed adjustment would result in approximately 700 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately 170 million furthermore if the irs prevails it is likely to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal 2006 the potential additional taxes for these later years through 2011 computed on a similar basis to the 20042006 additional taxes would be approximately 350 million plus net interest to date of approximately 25 million 

we believe that the company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable income tax laws treasury regulations and relevant case law we intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the irs as the final resolution of the proposed adjustment remains uncertain the company will continue to provide for its position in accordance with gaap there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position additionally if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue such increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution 

international reporting change 

in the first quarter of 2012 we will begin reporting information for our india business as a standalone reporting segment separate from yri as a result of changes to our management reporting structure while our consolidated results will not be impacted we will restate our historical segment information during 2012 for consistent presentation this new segment will also include the franchise businesses in the neighboring countries of bangladesh mauritius nepal and sri lanka

operating profit 



china division operating profit increased 20 in 2011 including a 5 favorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding foreign currency the increase was driven by the impact of samestore sales growth and net unit development partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs higher ga expenses and lapping the effect of our brands participation in the world expo in 2010

unallocated refranchising gain loss in 2011 2010 and 2009 is discussed in note 4 

interest expense net 



the decrease in interest expense net for 2011 was primarily driven by lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings in 2011 versus 2010 additionally interest income increased due to higher cash balances 

the decrease in interest expense net for 2010 was driven by both a decrease in average net borrowings and a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt 

income taxes 

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 



statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations this item includes local taxes withholding taxes and shareholderlevel taxes net of foreign tax credits the favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the us where tax rates are generally lower than the us rate 

in 2011 and 2010 the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of excess foreign tax credits generated by our intent to repatriate current year foreign earnings 

in 2009 the benefit was negatively impacted by withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends that were only partially offset by related foreign tax credits generated during the year 

adjustments to reserves and prior years this item includes 1 the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets and 2 changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these amounts on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for audit settlements and other events we believe may impact the outcome the impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the ‘statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations’  line 

in 2009 this item included outofyear adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate by 16 percentage points 

change in valuation allowance this item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year the impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the ‘statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations’  line 

in 2011 22 million of net tax expense was driven by 15 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year and 7 million of tax expense resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year these amounts exclude 45 million in valuation 

allowance additions related to capital losses recognized as a result of the ljs and aw divestitures which are presented within net benefit from ljs and aw divestitures  

in 2010 the 22 million of net tax expense was driven by 25 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year this expense was partially offset by a 3 million tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of us state deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

in 2009 the 9 million net tax benefit was driven by 25 million of benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year this benefit was partially offset by 16 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year 

net benefit from ljs and aw divestitures this item includes a onetime 117 million tax benefit including approximately 8 million state benefit recognized on the ljs and aw divestitures in 2011 partially offset by 45 million of valuation allowance including approximately 4 million state expense related to capital loss carryforwards recognized as a result of the divestitures in addition we recorded 32 million of tax benefits on 86 million of pretax losses and other costs which resulted in 104 million of total net tax benefits related to the divestitures 

other this item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings and us tax credits 

in 2009 this item was positively impacted by a onetime pretax gain of approximately 68 million with no related income tax expense recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of the entity that operates kfc in shanghai china this was partially offset by a pretax us goodwill impairment charge of approximately 26 million with no related income tax benefit 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities  was 2170 million compared to 1968 million in 2010 the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items 

in 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was 1968 million compared to 1404 million in 2009 the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items and decreased pension contributions 

net cash used in investing activities  was 1006 million versus 579 million in 2010 the increase was driven by an increase in restricted cash and higher capital spending 

in 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 579 million versus 727 million in 2009 the decrease was driven by lapping the 2009 acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in little sheep and increased proceeds from refranchising partially offset by the 2010 acquisition of our partner’s interest in rostik’skfc see note 4 for further discussion 

net cash used in financing activities  was 1413 million versus 337 million in 2010 the increase was driven by lower net borrowings and an increase in share repurchases 

in 2010 net cash used in financing activities was 337 million versus 542 million in 2009 the decrease was driven by higher net borrowings partially offset by an increase in share repurchases 

consolidated financial condition 

the increase in restricted cash was due to 300 million in funds placed in escrow which were restricted to the acquisition of an additional 66 interest in little sheep see notes 4 and 21 

the decrease in intangible assets was primarily due to the ljs and aw divestitures see note 4 

the decrease in shortterm borrowings was primarily due to the maturity of 650 million of senior unsecured notes in april 2011 offset by 263 million of senior unsecured notes due in june 2012 being classified as short term as of december 31 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion in each of the last ten fiscal years including over 2 billion in 2011 we expect these levels of net cash provided by 

operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 

in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders additionally as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 11 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in november 2012 primarily related to a domestic facility we are in the process of renewing these facilities 

china and yri represented more than 70 of the company’s operating profit in 2011 excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including share repurchases dividends and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a taxefficient manner   if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

we currently have investmentgrade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets costeffectively if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 31 2011 which included no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities our interest expense would not materially increase on a fullyear basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2011 we invested 940 million in capital spending including approximately 405 million in china 256 million in yri and 279 million in the us for 2012 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 1 billion 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased shares for 752 million which includes the effect of 19 million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the 2010 fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the 2010 fiscal year in january 2011 our board of directors authorized share repurchases through july 2012 of up to 750 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock and on november 18 2011 our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may 2013 of up to 750 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2011 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to approximately 938 million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under these authorizations shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we paid cash dividends of 481 million additionally on november 18 2011 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 0285 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 3 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 13 2012 the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income 

in connection with the proposal to acquire an additional 66 of little sheep we placed 300 million in escrow to demonstrate availability of funds to acquire additional shares in this business the funds placed in escrow were restricted to the pending acquisition of little sheep and are separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011  and in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2011  in february 2012 the funds were released from escrow upon our acquisition of little sheep see notes 4 and 21 for details 

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 115 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in november 2012 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from 20 million to 93 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 31 2011 our unused credit facility totaled 727 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 423 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2011 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 025 to 125 over the london interbank offered rate 

“libor” or is determined by an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

we also have a 350 million syndicated international revolving credit facility the “icf” which matures in november 2012 and includes six banks with commitments ranging from 35 million to 90 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank there was available credit of 350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of 2011 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 031 to 150 over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

the credit facility and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries additionally the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 31 2011 with a considerable amount of cushion 

we are in the process of renewing these facilities 

our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2012 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 238 to 770 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 30 billion at december 31 2011 including 263 million in senior unsecured notes due in july 2012 

both the credit facility and the icf contain crossdefault provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 100 million or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness will constitute a default under such agreement our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled or such indebtedness is not discharged within 30 days after notice 

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2011  included 



 

 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 327 million of longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities also include potential payments that would be refunded in a future year and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of these plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan’s funded status at december 31 2011 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 248 million the uk pension plans are in a net underfunded position of 4 million at our 2011 measurement date 

based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans we currently estimate that we will be required to contribute approximately 30 million to the plan in 2012 no required contributions to the uk pension plans are expected in 2012 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2012 and beyond 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 5 million in 2011 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee healthcare longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have agreed to provide financial support if required to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s historical refranchising programs as part of this agreement we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately 14 million and two letters of credit totaling approximately 23 million in support of the franchisee loan program at december 31 2011 one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee the other letter of credit could be used in certain circumstances to satisfy our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were 63 million with an additional 17 million available for lending at december 31 2011  

our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately 75 million and 70 million of debt outstanding as of december 31 2011  and december 25 2010  respectively 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic 820fair value measurement  asu 201104 to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements asu 201104 is effective for the company in its first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will be applied 

prospectively the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu 201104 but currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201105 comprehensive income topic 220presentation of comprehensive income  asu 201105 to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements asu 201105 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity asu 201105 is effective for the company in its first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will be applied retrospectively the company currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this standard 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization that are currently operating semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay and discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay for the group of restaurants the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we have certain definitelived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant such as trademarkbrand intangible assets and franchise contract rights which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 

these definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted aftertax cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definitelived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property plant and equipment 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us our yri business units typically individual countries and our china division brands fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2011 goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value amount being disposed if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2011 the companys reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our kfc us operating segment and our pizza hut united kingdom “uk” business unit within our kfc us operating segment 264 restaurants were refranchised representing 34 of beginningofyear company units and 8 million in goodwill was written off representing 7 of beginningofyear goodwill within our pizza hut uk business unit 47 delivery restaurants were refranchised representing 10 of beginningofyear company units and 4 million in goodwill was written off representing 4 of beginningofyear goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

allowances for franchise and license receivablesguarantees 

franchise and license receivable balances include royalties initial fees and other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon predefined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december 31 2011 as such we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december 31 2011 

we issue certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1 assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 2 facilitating franchisee development and 3 equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification such as franchise lease renewals 

when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 

the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases discounted at our pretax cost of debt is approximately 550 million at december 31 2011 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases additionally we have guaranteed approximately 17 million of franchisee loans for various programs we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under assigned leases and certain of the loan programs we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and historically we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees at december 31 2011  we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our guarantees 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured workers compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the underfunded status of 383 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1381 million and a fair value of plan assets of 998 million at december 31 2011  

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbo using a discount rate of 490 at december 31 2011  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plan we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary a 50 basispoint increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 107 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basispoint decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 121 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2012  is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately 36 million in 2012  the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss due to a decrease in the discount rate a 50 basispoint change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2012  us pension expense by approximately 17 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category 

adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2012  pension expense at december 31 2011  was 725 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentagepoint change in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2012  us pension expense by approximately 10 million 

a decrease in discount rates over time along with actual asset returns below expected returns have largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax actuarial net loss of 540 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 31 2011  for purposes of determining 2011 pension expense our funded status was such that we recognized 31 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 63 million of such loss in 2012

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 15 additionally we estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically approximately 10  15 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliffvest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurantlevel employees and to executives respectively 

upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options we have estimated prevesting forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 50 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 25 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

income taxes 

at december 31 2011  we had valuation allowances of 368 million to reduce our 13 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in currently profitable us federal and state and foreign jurisdictions as well as us federal and state tax credit carryovers that may be carried forward for ten years the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2011  we had 348 million of unrecognized tax benefits 197 million of which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis totaling approximately 17 billion at december 31 2011  as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested if our intentions regarding the duration of theses investments change deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 

at december 31 2011  and december 25 2010  a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 5 million and 8 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2011  and december 25 2010  would decrease approximately 16 million and 22 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 31 2011  and december 25 2010  would decrease approximately 228 million and 191 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments historically we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

the combined operating profits of china and yri constitute more than 70 of our operating profit in 2011  excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 30 billion as of december 31 2011  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  operating profit would have decreased approximately 170 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

general 

yum is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on number of system units with more than 37000 units in more than 110 countries and territories through the five concepts of kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one unit to large publicly traded companies in addition the company owns noncontrolling interests in entities in china who operate similar to franchisees of kfc and a noncontrolling interest in little sheep a hot pot concept headquartered in hong kong 

  

  

at year end 2010 we had approximately 20000 system restaurants in the us and recorded revenues of 41 billion and operating profit of 668 million during 2010 the international division based in dallas texas comprises approximately 14000 system restaurants primarily kfcs and pizza huts operating in over 110 countries outside the us in 2010 yri recorded revenues of 31 billion and operating profit of 589 million the china division based in shanghai china comprises approximately 4000 system restaurants in china primarily kfcs and pizza huts in 2010 the china division recorded revenues of 41 billion and operating profit of 755 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell kfc ljs and aw offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building and equipment and purchasing signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in the us the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit conceptowned restaurants from time to time to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by third party distribution companies mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in conceptowned restaurants in the us and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores the company entered into a new agreement with mclane effective january 1 2011 relating to distribution to conceptowned restaurants in the us this agreement extends through december 31 2016 and generally restricts conceptowned restaurants from using alternative distributors in the us for most products

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements and historical trends 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants including restaurants operated by our franchisees to instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits if customers of our concepts or franchisees become ill from foodborne illnesses we and our franchisees may temporarily close some restaurants in addition instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of competitors could adversely affect our sales as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally foodborne illness food tampering and food contamination could also be caused by food suppliers or distributors and as a result could be out of our control the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our franchisees 

  

  

our china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located in china as a result our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including wage and commodity inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

our other foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant portion of our concepts’ restaurants are operated in foreign countries and territories outside of the us and china and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by market include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including wage and commodity inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels the regulatory environment tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales 

 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the united states especially china the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner and hire and train qualified personnel 

our franchisees also frequently depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants if it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants our planned growth could slow and our future revenue and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby it is not our intention to open new restaurants that materially cannibalize the sales of our existing restaurants however as with most growing retail and restaurant operations there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets over time 

  

  

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food energy and supply costs could adversely affect our operating results because our concepts and their franchisees provide moderately priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers is limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our business our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

 

we are dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations in addition failure by a principal distributor for our concepts andor our franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards product quality issues inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

concerns regarding the safety of food ingredients or products that we source from our suppliers could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

a significant portion of our revenue consists of royalties from our franchisees because a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are run by franchisees the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees while our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines we have limited control over how our franchisees’ businesses are run and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments for example franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us in addition franchisees may not be able to find suitable sites on which to develop new restaurants or negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 

  

  

if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt it could result in financial distress including insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

our results and financial condition could be affected by the success of our refranchising program 

 

we are in the process of refranchising restaurants in the us which could reduce the percentage of company ownership of kfcs pizza huts and taco bells in the us from approximately 15 at the end of 2010 to approximately 12 by the end of 2011 our ability to execute this plan will depend on among other things whether we receive fair offers for these restaurants whether we can find viable and suitable buyers and how quickly we can agree to terms with potential buyers in addition financing for restaurant purchases can be expensive or difficult to obtain if buyers cannot obtain financing at attractive prices – or if they are unable to obtain financing at any price – our refranchising program could be delayed 

once executed the success of the refranchising program will depend on among other things buyers effectively operating these restaurants the impact of contingent liabilities incurred in connection with refranchising and whether the resulting ownership mix of companyoperated and franchiseeoperated restaurants allows us to meet our financial objectives in addition refranchising activity could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and that volatility could impact our reported earnings 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour and other laws plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance with respect to insured claims a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels future outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to eat less chicken widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

furthermore other viruses such as h1n1 or “swine flu” may be transmitted through human contact and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may affect our business 

  

  

our success depends substantially on the value and perception of our brands 

our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers’ connection to our brands brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities and even isolated business incidents can erode brand value and consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation for example our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality of our products regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are accurate consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products which would likely result in lower sales and ultimately profits 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

 

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment disposable income and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales mix profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the impact of potentially limited credit availability on third party vendors such as our suppliers cannot be predicted the inability of our suppliers to access financing or the insolvency of suppliers could lead to disruptions in our supply chain which could adversely impact our sales and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

 

our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world our restaurants are subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food workplace safety fire and other agencies in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly complex federal and state immigration laws and regulations in the us 

we are also subject to the americans with disabilities act in the us and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations in the us are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we also face risks from new or changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor in addition we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

  

we are also subject to increasing environmental regulations which could result in increased taxation or future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies transportation costs and utility costs any of which could decrease our operating profits andor necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our effective tax rate could increase negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant percentage of our profits are earned outside the us and taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates if we were to experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us businesses or were unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings to fund our us cash needs such international earnings would be subject to us tax at the point in time we did not believe they were permanently invested outside the us which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

additionally our federal state and local tax returns are frequently the subject of audits by taxing authorities and those audits may result in tax assessments andor penalties although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation 

 

we receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and employees the use of this information by us is regulated by applicable law as well as by certain third party contracts if our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could adversely affect our reputation as well as our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance 

 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development price advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our margins

segment reporting change

strategies 

the company continues to focus on four key strategies 

build leading brands in china in every significant category – the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants respectively in mainland china additionally the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage given this strong competitive position a growing economy and a population of 13 billion in mainland china the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of pizza hut home service pizza delivery and east dawning chinese food our ongoing earnings growth model in china includes double digit unit growth same store sales growth of at least 4 and leverage of our general and administrative “ga” infrastructure which we expect to drive operating profit growth of 15 

drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere – the company and its franchisees opened nearly 900 new restaurants in 2010 in the company’s international division representing 11 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants and yri is one of the leading international retail developers in terms of units opened the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including france russia and india the international division’s operating profit has experienced an 8 year compound annual growth rate of 11 our ongoing earnings growth model for yri includes operating profit growth of 10 driven by 34 net unit growth at least 23 same store sales growth modest margin improvement and leverage of our ga infrastructure 

dramatically improve us brand positions consistency and returns – the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience the company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on company owned restaurants our ongoing earnings growth model calls for operating profit growth of 5 in the us as we near completion of our refranchising program in 2011 the taco bell operating segment will become an increasingly larger component of us ongoing earnings growth the us ongoing earnings growth model includes taco bell operating profit growth of 6 driven by modest unit growth same store sales growth of 3 and leverage of our ga infrastructure 

  

  

drive industryleading longterm shareholder and franchisee value – the company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases the company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the quick service restaurants “qsr” industry the company’s dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over 16 billion and 6 billion to shareholders respectively since 2004 the company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend each year since inception in 2004 shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions

significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results 

special items 

in addition to the results provided in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” above and throughout this document the company has provided nongaap measurements which present operating results in 2010 2009 and 2008 on a basis before special items included in special items are the impact of measures we took to transform our us business “the us business transformation measures” including the us refranchising gain loss the depreciation reduction arising from the impairment of kfc restaurants we offered to sell in 2010 charges relating to us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources investments in our us brands and a 2009 us goodwill impairment charge special items also include losses recognized in 2010 and 2009 as a result of our decision to refranchise our equity markets in mexico and taiwan the 2009 gain upon our acquisition of additional ownership in and consolidation of the operating entity that owns the kfcs in shanghai china and the 2008 gain on the sale of our minority interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate these amounts are further described below 

  

  

 

the company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and special items are not included in our china division yri or us segment results this nongaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations excluding items in 2010 2009 and 2008 that the company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature 

 

 

  

  

us business transformation measures 

the us business transformation measures in 2010 2009 and 2008 included expansion of our us refranchising a reduced emphasis on multibranding as a longterm growth strategy ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases we do not believe these measures are indicative of our ongoing operations and are not including the impacts of these us business transformation measures in our us segment for performance reporting purposes 

in the years ended december 25 2010 and december 27 2008 we recorded pretax losses of 18 million and 5 million from refranchising in the us respectively in the year ended december 26 2009 we recorded a pretax refranchising gain of 34 million in the us the loss recorded in the year ended december 25 2010 is the net result of gains from 404 restaurants sold and noncash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us principally a substantial portion of our company operated kfc restaurants the noncash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise a substantial portion of our company operated kfc restaurants in the us which were mostly recorded in the first quarter of 2010 decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by 9 million in the year ended december 25 2010 this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item resulting in depreciation expense in the us segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charge being recorded for these restaurants the refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note 4 and the store portfolio strategy section of the mda 

in connection with our ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs we recorded pretax charges of 9 million 16 million and 49 million in the years ended december 25 2010 december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively we realized a 65 million decline in our us ga expenses in the year ended december 26 2009 driven by the us productivity initiatives and realignment of resource measures we took in 2008 and 2009 

as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs and aw us businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multibranding we recorded a noncash charge of 26 million in closures and impairment expenses which resulted in no related income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 to writeoff goodwill associated with these businesses 

additionally the company recognized a reduction to franchise and license fees and income of 32 million pretax in the year ended december 26 2009 related to investments in our us brands these investments reflect our reimbursements to kfc franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of kentucky grilled chicken the reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship in the year ended december 27 2008 the company recognized pretax expense of 7 million related to investments in our us brands in franchise and license expenses 

  

  

refranchising of equity markets outside the us 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 52 million loss on the refranchising of our mexico equity market as we sold all of our company operated restaurants comprised of 222 kfcs and 123 pizza huts to an existing latin american franchise partner the buyer will also serve as the master franchisee for mexico which had 102 kfcs and 53 pizza hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction the write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our mexico reporting unit includes an insignificant amount of goodwill this loss did not result in any related income tax benefit and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 

during the year ended december 26 2009 we recognized a noncash 10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our kfc taiwan equity market during the year ended december 25 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in taiwan which consisted of 124 kfcs we included in our december 25 2010 financial statements a noncash writeoff of 7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of taiwan neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit and neither loss was allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes   the amount of goodwill writeoff was based on the relative fair values of the taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained the fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction the fair value of the taiwan business retained consists of expected net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction we believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the taiwan refranchising are substantially consistent with market the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our taiwan business of 30 million after the aforementioned writeoff was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 

consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in shanghai china 

on may 4 2009 we acquired an additional 7 ownership in the entity that operates more than 200 kfcs in shanghai china for 12 million increasing our ownership to 58 prior to our acquisition of this additional interest this entity was accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition as required by gaap we remeasured our previously held 51 ownership in the entity which had a recorded value of 17 million at the date of acquisition at fair value and recognized a gain of 68 million accordingly this gain which resulted in no related income tax expense was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statements of income in 2009 and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 

  

  

under the equity method of accounting we previously reported our 51 share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate subsequent to the date of the acquisition we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statements of income we no longer recorded franchise fee income for these restaurants nor did we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting net income attributable to our partner’s ownership percentage is recorded as net incomenoncontrolling interest within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 25 2010 the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased company sales by 98 million decreased franchise and license fees and income by 6 million and positively impacted operating profit by 3 million for the year ended december 26 2009 the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased company sales by 192 million decreased franchise and license fees and income by 12 million and positively impacted operating profit by 4 million the impact on net income – yum brands inc was not significant to the years ended december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 

sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan 

during the year ended december 27 2008 we recorded a pretax gain of approximately 100 million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan see note 4 for further discussion of this transaction this gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 

russia acquisition 

on july 1 2010 we completed the exercise of our option with our russian partner to purchase their interest in the cobranded rostik’skfc restaurants across russia and the commonwealth of independent states as a result we acquired company ownership of 50 restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of 81 restaurants which our partner previously managed as master franchisee upon exercise of our option we paid cash of 56 million net of settlement of a longterm note receivable of 11 million and assumed longterm debt of 10 million the remaining balance of the purchase price anticipated to be 11 million will be paid in cash in july 2012 as a result of our preliminary purchase price allocation for this acquisition our consolidated balance sheet includes 36 million of goodwill and 36 million of identifiable intangibles at december 25 2010 the impact of consolidating this business on all line items within our consolidated statement of income was insignificant for the year ended december 25 2010 

pizza hut south korea goodwill impairment

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital in the us we are targeting company ownership of kfc pizza hut and taco bell restaurants of about 12 down from its current level of 15 this us target ownership percentage no longer considers the impact of ljs and aw restaurants both of which are completely franchise operated as we are pursuing a sale of these brands consistent with this strategy 404 541 and 700 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december 25 2010 december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively and at december 25 2010 we have offered for refranchising approximately 550 kfcs in the us during 2010 we also executed refranchising of all company owned kfcs and pizza huts in mexico 345 restaurants and kfcs in taiwan 124 restaurants 

  

  

refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of ga declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities 

 

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and ga expenses and b the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year in these tables decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year increased franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year

internal revenue service proposed adjustment 

on june 23 2010 the company received a revenue agent report “rar” from the internal revenue service the “irs” relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries the proposed adjustment would result in approximately 700 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately 150 million furthermore if the irs prevails it is likely to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal 2006 the potential additional taxes for these later years through 2010 computed on a similar basis to the 20042006 additional taxes would be approximately 320 million plus net interest to date of approximately 20 million 

we believe that the company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable income tax laws treasury regulations and relevant case law we intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the irs as the final resolution of the proposed adjustment remains uncertain the company will continue to provide for its position in this matter based on the tax benefit that we believe is the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement of this issue there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position   additionally if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue such increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution 

taco bell beef issue 

in late january 2011 a lawsuit was filed alleging a violation of consumer protection statutes and deceptive business practices by taco bell through its advertising that the beef served in its products is “seasoned beef” though the company denies all claims within the lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position the resulting negative publicity regarding its food quality has adversely impacted taco bell sales in both company and franchise stores while we do not anticipate a sustained negative impact on taco bell’s sales it is difficult for us to predict if there will be any significant impact on our 2011 revenues and operating profit given the recent nature of the adverse publicity 

sale of long john silver’s and aw 

subsequent to the end of our fourth quarter we decided to place our long john silver’s and aw allamerican food restaurants brands for sale and began the process to identify a buyer in the first quarter of 2011 we anticipate that we will recognize a noncash pretax impairment loss in special items as a result of our decision to sell the amount of the expected pretax loss as well as the related tax impact will be dependent upon indications we receive as to potential sales prices and structures we do not expect the eventual sale to have a material impact to our ongoing earnings or cash flows

the dollar changes in company restaurant profit by year were as follows

the increase in yri ga expenses for 2010 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was driven by increased investment in strategic growth markets including costs related to the russia acquisition see note 4 for further discussion partially offset by ga savings from refranchising all of our remaining company restaurants in taiwan 

in 2009 the increase in yri ga expenses excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was driven by increased investment in strategic growth markets

china division operating profit increased 27 in 2010 including a 1 or 6 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development partially offset by higher ga costs operating profit benefited 16 million from our brands’ participation in the world expo during 2010

interest expense net decreased 19 million or 9 in 2010 this decrease was driven by both a decrease in average net borrowings and a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt 

interest expense net decreased 32 million or 14 in 2009 this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt and a decrease in borrowings in 2009 as compared to 2008 

income taxes 

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 

 

statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations this item includes local taxes withholding taxes and shareholderlevel taxes net of foreign tax credits the favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the us where tax rates are generally lower than the us rate 

in 2010 the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of excess foreign tax credits generated by our intent to repatriate current year foreign earnings 

  

  

in 2009 the benefit was negatively impacted by withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends that were only partially offset by related foreign tax credits generated during the year 

in 2008 the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by tax planning actions implemented in 2008 17 percentage points in addition the benefit was also favorably impacted by a decrease in tax expense for certain foreign markets 

adjustments to reserves and prior years this item includes 1 the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets and 2 changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these amounts on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for audit settlements and other events we believe may impact the outcome the impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the ‘statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations’ line 

in 2010 this item included a net increase in tax expense driven by the reversal of foreign tax credits for prior years that are not likely to be claimed on future tax returns 

in 2009 this item included outofyear adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate by 16 percentage points 

in 2008 this item included outofyear adjustments which increased our effective tax rate by 18 percentage points 

change in valuation allowance this item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year the impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the ‘statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations’ line 

in 2010 the 22 million of net tax expense was driven by 25 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year this expense was partially offset by a 3 million tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of us state deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

in 2009 the 9 million net tax benefit was driven by 25 million of benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year this benefit was partially offset by 16 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year 

in 2008 the 12 million net tax expense was primarily due to 42 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year including a full valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets for net operating losses generated by tax planning actions as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized in the future this increase was partially offset by 30 million of benefits primarily resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 

  

  

other this item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings and us tax credits 

in 2009 this item was positively impacted by a onetime pretax gain of approximately 68 million with no related income tax expense recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of the entity that operates kfc in shanghai china this was partially offset by a pretax us goodwill impairment charge of approximately 26 million with no related income tax benefit 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1968 million compared to 1404 million in 2009 the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items and decreased pension contributions 

in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 1404   million compared to 1521   million in 2008 the decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions partially offset by higher operating profit before special items 

net cash used in investing activities was 579 million versus 727 million in 2009 the decrease was driven by lapping the 2009 acquisition of an interest in little sheep as discussed in note 4 and increased proceeds from refranchising partially offset by the 2010 acquisition of our partner’s interest in rostik’skfc see note 4 for further discussion 

in 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 727 million versus 641 million in 2008 the increase was driven by the acquisition of an interest in little sheep lower proceeds from refranchising and sales of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower capital spending 

in december 2007 we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for 128 million includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 2007 the international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close thus consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period the pretax gain on the sale of this investment of 100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 however the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december 2007 and were thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 29 2007 

net cash used in financing activities was 337 million versus 542 million in 2009 the decrease was driven by higher net borrowings partially offset by an increase in share repurchases 

in 2009 net cash used in financing activities was 542 million versus 1459 million in 2008 the decrease was driven by a reduction in share repurchases partially offset by net payments on debt 

consolidated financial condition 

the increase in shortterm borrowings was primarily due to the classification of 650 million in senior unsecured notes as shortterm borrowings due to the april 2011 maturity date 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited yum investment net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion in each of the last nine fiscal years including nearly 2 billion in 2010 we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 

in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders additionally as of december 25 2010 we had approximately 13 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in 2012 primarily related to a domestic facility 

during the third quarter of 2010 we issued 350 million aggregate principal amount of 388 10 year senior unsecured notes due to the favorable credit markets as a result of issuing the senior unsecured notes as well as our continued strong cash flows from operating activities we have cash and cash equivalents at december 25 2010 that are higher than our historical levels our cash equivalents are temporarily invested in shortterm investment grade securities with maturities of three months or less we anticipate using a significant amount of these cash and cash equivalents when 650 million in senior unsecured notes come due in april 2011 

our china division and yri represented more than 65 of the company’s operating profit in 2010 excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including share repurchases dividends and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner as a result of our substantial international development a significant amount of investments in foreign subsidiaries are essentially permanent in duration as of december 25 2010 if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

we currently have investment grade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 25 2010 which included no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2010 we invested 796 million in capital spending including approximately 265 million in the us 259 million for the international division and 272 million for the china division for 2011 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 900 million 

during the year ended december 25 2010 we repurchased shares for 390 million which includes the effect of 19 million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the 2010 fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the 2010 fiscal year in march 2010 our board of directors authorized share repurchases through march 2011 of up to 300 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock at december 25 2010 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to approximately 193 million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the march 2010 authorization additionally on january 27 2011 our board of directors authorized share repurchases through july 2012 of up to 750 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 

  

  

during the year ended december 25 2010 we paid cash dividends of 412 million additionally on november 19 2010 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 025 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 4 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 14 2011 the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35  40 of net income 

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 115 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in november 2012 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from 10 million to 113 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 25 2010 our unused credit facility totaled 998 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 152 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 25 2010 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 025 to 125 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or is determined by an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

we also have a 350 million syndicated revolving credit facility the “international credit facility” or “icf” which matures in november 2012 and includes 6 banks with commitments ranging from 35 million to 90 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank there was available credit of 350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of 2010 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 031 to 150 over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

the credit facility and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries additionally the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 25 2010 with a considerable amount of cushion 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2011 through 2037 and stated interest rates ranging from 388 to 888 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 33 billion at december 25 2010 including 650 million in senior unsecured notes due in april 2011 

  

  

both the credit facility and the icf contain crossdefault provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 100 million or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness will constitute a default under such agreement our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled or such indebtedness is not discharged within 30 days after notice 

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 25 2010 included 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 322 million for longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

  

  

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of these plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan’s funded status at december 25 2010 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 100 million the uk pension plans are in a net underfunded position of 23 million at our 2010 measurement date 

based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans we will not be required to make significant contributions in 2011 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions beyond 2011 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 7 million in 2010 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee healthcare longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have agreed to provide financial support if required to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s historical refranchising programs as part of this agreement we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately 15 million and two letters of credit totaling approximately 23 million in support of the franchisee loan program at december 25 2010 one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee the other letter of credit could be used in certain circumstances to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were 70 million with an additional 30 million available for lending at december 25 2010 

our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately 70 million and 40 million of debt outstanding as of december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 respectively

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new guidelines and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements this guidance requires enhanced disclosures for purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis for level 3 fair value measurements we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the company these new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2010 

  

  

in july 2010 the fasb issued accounting guidance that requires new disclosures about an entity’s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables existing disclosures are amended to require an entity to provide certain disclosures on a disaggregated basis by portfolio segment or by class of financing receivables the new disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december 15 2010 and have been complied with in this form 10k the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december 15 2010 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization that are currently operating semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are not deemed to be recoverable we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future aftertax cash flows of the restaurant and discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the group of restaurants the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we have certain definitelived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant such as the ljs and aw trademarkbrand intangible assets and franchise contract rights which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 

these definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted aftertax cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definitelived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property plant and equipment 

  

  

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us our yri business units typically individual countries and our china division brands fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2010 goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter however our pizza hut united kingdom “uk” reporting unit for which 104 million in goodwill was recorded at year end 2010 has experienced deteriorating operating performance over the past several years as sales and profits have declined our forecasts of future cash flows in determining the fair value of this reporting unit incorporate plans that have been put into place to return the business to previous levels of profitability these plans include specific measures to drive system sales growth which is the assumption that most significantly drives the cash flow expectations and resulting fair value estimations of the reporting unit over the next three years while such forecasted system sales growth is higher than what we would normally anticipate for a mature market like pizza hut uk such growth is reflective of our belief that the business has experienced a temporary downturn and that sales declines in recent years can be recovered if our plans to drive system sales growth are not achieved or are not expected to be achieved this could impact future estimations of fair value of the pizza hut uk reporting unit and result in impairment of some or all of the pizza hut uk recorded goodwill likewise if other events such as higher than anticipated inflation that we were unable to recover through increased sales were to occur that would negatively impact the outlook for the business and our resulting estimations of fair value some or all of the goodwill could be impaired 

when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee which include a deduction for the anticipated future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction appropriate adjustments are made if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of nearterm fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the longterm the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 

  

  

the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 

during 2010 the company’s reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our taiwan business unit and our pizza hutus operating segment within our taiwan business unit 124 restaurants were refranchised representing 100 of beginning of year company units and 7 million in goodwill was written off representing 19 of beginning of year goodwill within our pizza hutus operating segment 278 restaurants were refranchised representing 43 of beginning of year company units and 3 million in goodwill was written off representing 4 of beginning of year goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

allowances for franchise and license receivablesguarantees 

franchise and license receivable balances include royalties initial fees as well as other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon predefined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december 25 2010 as such we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december 25 2010 

we have historically issued certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1 assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 2 facilitating franchisee development and 3 equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification such as renewals when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 

the potential total exposure for lease assignments is significant when aggregated with approximately 450 million representing the present value discounted at our pretax cost of debt of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 25 2010 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases additionally we have guaranteed approximately 23 million of franchisee loans for various equipment programs we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under assigned leases and certain of the equipment loan programs we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and historically we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees at december 25 2010 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our guarantees 

  

  

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 19 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the underfunded status of 201 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 25 2010 these us plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1108 million and a fair value of plan assets of 907 million at december 25 2010 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo’s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbo using a discount rate of 590 at december 25 2010 this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary   a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 95 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 104 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2011 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately 8 million to 49 million in 2011 the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2011 us pension expense by approximately 15 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2011 pension expense at december 25 2010 was 775 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our 2011 us pension plans’ expense by approximately 9 million 

  

  

the losses our us plan assets have experienced along with a decrease in discount rates over time have largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax net loss of 363 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 25 2010 for purposes of determining 2010 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 23 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 31 million of such loss in 2011 

see note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans 

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our specific weightedaverage assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 15 additionally we estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically approximately 10  15 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis based on the results of this analysis we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives respectively 

upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options we have estimated prevesting forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 50 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 25 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

  

  

income taxes 

at december 25 2010 we had a valuation allowance of 191 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of 220 million as well as our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits exist in state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage including approximately 108 million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 25 2010 we had 308 million of unrecognized tax benefits 227 million of which if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis totaling approximately 13 billion at december 25 2010 as we believe the excess is essentially permanent in duration if our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

at december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 8 million and 6 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 would decrease approximately 22 million and 20 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 would decrease approximately 191 million and 181 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute more than 65 of our operating profit in 2010 excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 32 billion as of december 25 2010 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 25 2010 operating profit would have decreased approximately 135 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

this form 10k should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements on page 2 and the risk factors set forth in item 1a 

 

in january 1997 pepsico announced its decision to spinoff its restaurant businesses to shareholders as an independent public company the “spinoff” effective october 6 1997 pepsico disposed of its restaurant businesses by distributing all of the outstanding shares of common stock of yum to its shareholders on may 16 2002 following receipt of shareholder approval the company changed its name from tricon global restaurants inc to yum brands inc 

 

yum consists of six operating segments kfcus pizza hutus taco bellus long john silver’s “ljs”us and aw all american food restaurants “aw”us yum restaurants international “yri” or “international division” and yum restaurants china “china division” for financial reporting purposes management considers the four us operating segments to be similar and therefore has aggregated them into a single reportable operating segment “us” the china division includes mainland china “china” thailand and kfc taiwan and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations 

operating segment information for the years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 for the company is included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” in part ii item 7 pages 24 through 58 and in the related consolidated financial statements and footnotes in part ii item 8 pages 59 through 116 

 

general 

yum is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on number of system units with more than 37000 units in more than 110 countries and territories through the five concepts of kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items units are operated by a concept or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one unit to large publicly traded companies in addition the company owns noncontrolling interests in entities in china who operate similar to franchisees of kfc and a noncontrolling interest in little sheep a hot pot concept headquartered in hong kong 

  

  

at year end 2009 we had approximately 20000 system restaurants in the us which achieved revenues of 45 billion and operating profit of 647 million during 2009 the international division based in dallas texas comprises approximately 13000 system restaurants primarily kfcs and pizza huts operating in over 110 countries outside the us in 2009 yri achieved revenues of 27 billion and operating profit of 491 million the china division based in shanghai china comprises approximately 4000 system restaurants predominately kfcs in 2009 the china division achieved revenues of 37 billion and operating profit of 602 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell kfc ljs and aw offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building and equipment and purchasing signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each conceptowned restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in the us the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis each concept issues detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit conceptowned restaurants from time to time to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

  

  

supply and distribution 

the company’s concepts and franchisees are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products seafood paper and packaging materials 

the company is committed to conducting its business in an ethical legal and socially responsible manner all restaurants regardless of their ownership structure or location must adhere to strict food quality and safety standards the guidelines are translated to local market requirements and regulations where appropriate and without compromising the standards the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forwardlooking statements and historical trends these risks are not exclusive and our business and our results of operations could also be affected by other risks that we cannot anticipate or that we do not consider material based on currently available information 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts to instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants in addition instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of competitors could adversely affect our sales as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally foodborne illness food tampering and food contamination could also be caused by food suppliers or distributors and as a result could be out of our control the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our franchisees 

furthermore like other companies in the restaurant industry some of our products may contain genetically engineered food products and our us suppliers are currently not required to label their products as such increased regulation of and opposition to genetically engineered food products have on occasion and may in the future force the use of alternative sources at increased costs and lower margins for us and our franchisees 

  

  

our china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located in china as a result our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including wage and commodity inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china although management believes it has structured our china operations to comply with local laws there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

our other foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated in foreign countries and territories outside of the us and china and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by market include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including wage and commodity inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels the regulatory environment tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies such as the chinese renminbi australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food energy and supply costs could adversely affect our operating results because we provide moderately priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers may be limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our business our operating expenses also include employee benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time 

  

  

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

 

we are dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations in addition if a principal distributor for our concepts andor our franchisees fails to meet its service requirements for any reason it could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged which could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards product quality issues inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

concerns regarding the safety of food ingredients or products that we source from our suppliers could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

we receive significant revenues in the form of royalties from our franchisees because a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are run by franchisees the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees while our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines we have limited control over how our franchisees’ businesses are run and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments for example franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us in addition franchisees may not be able to find suitable sites on which to develop new restaurants or negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 

if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt it could result in financial distress or even possible insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed this could harm our operating results through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

  

  

our results and financial condition could be affected by the success of our refranchising program 

 

we are in the process of a refranchising program which could reduce the percentage of company ownership in the us excluding licensees from approximately 16 at the end of 2009 to potentially less than 10 by the end of 2011 our ability to execute this plan will depend on among other things whether we receive fair offers for these restaurants whether we can find viable and suitable buyers and how quickly we can agree to terms with potential buyers in addition some lenders have increased lending requirements or otherwise reduced the amount of loans they are making generally or to the restaurant industry in particular to the extent potential buyers are unable to obtain financing at attractive prices – or unable to obtain financing at any price – our refranchising program could be delayed 

once executed the success of the refranchising program will depend on among other things selection of buyers who can effectively operate these restaurants our ability to limit our exposure to contingent liabilities in connection with the sale of our restaurants and whether the resulting ownership mix of companyoperated and franchiseeoperated restaurants allows us to meet our financial objectives in addition refranchising activity could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and that volatility could impact our reported earnings 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant money damages and other remedies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour and other laws plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a judgment for significant monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels while fullycooked chicken has been determined to be safe for consumption and while we have taken and continue to take measures to prepare for and minimize the effect of these outbreaks on our business future outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to eat less chicken in addition outbreaks on a widespread basis could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

to the extent a virus such as h1n1 or “swine flu” is transmitted through human contact employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may affect our business 

  

  

we may not attain our target development goals 

 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the united states the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open new restaurants upgrade existing restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new upgraded or converted restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any restaurant we open or convert will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations obtain required permits and approvals and hire and train qualified personnel 

our franchisees also frequently depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants disruptions in credit markets may make financing more difficult or expensive to obtain if it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants our planned growth could slow and our future revenue and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions 

 

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve worldwide economic conditions and consumer spending have deteriorated and there can be no assurance that consumer spending will return to prior levels some of the factors that are having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include increased unemployment reductions in disposable income as a result of equity market declines and declines in residential real estate values credit availability and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales mix profitability or development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the impact of potentially limited credit availability on third party vendors such as our suppliers cannot be predicted the inability of our suppliers to access financing or the insolvency of suppliers could lead to disruptions in our supply chain which could adversely impact our sales and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

 

we and our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food workplace safety fire and other agencies requirements of local authorities with respect to zoning land use licensing permitting and environmental standards could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly complex federal and state immigration laws and regulations 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

  

we also face risks from new or changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling regulation compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor in addition we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development price advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer or dietary preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals including pizzas and entrees with side dishes in addition in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our margins

segment reporting changes 

in the first quarter of 2010 we will begin reporting information for our thailand and kfc taiwan businesses within our international division as a result of changes to our management reporting structure the china division will only consist of operations in mainland china and the international division will include the remainder of our international operations while our consolidated results will not be impacted we will restate our historical segment information during 2010 for consistent presentation all forward looking information within this mda reflects these changes in our reporting structure 

in connection with our us business transformation measures our reported segment results began reflecting increased allocations of certain expenses in 2009 that were previously reported as unallocated and corporate ga expenses while our consolidated results were not impacted we believe the revised allocation better aligns costs with accountability of our segment managers these revised allocations are being used by our chairman and chief executive officer in his role as chief operating decision maker in his assessment of operating performance we have restated segment information for the years ended december 27  2008 and december 29 2007 to be consistent with the current period presentation

results of operations 

 

 

significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results 

special items 

 

in addition to the results provided in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” above and throughout this document the company has provided nongaap measurements which present operating results in 2009 and 2008 on a basis before special items included in special items are the impact of measures we took to transform our us business “the us business transformation measures” including the us refranchising gain loss charges relating to us general and administrative “ga” productivity initiatives and realignment of resources investments in our us brands and a 2009 us goodwill impairment charge special items also include the 2009 loss recognized as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise an equity market outside the us the 2009 gain upon our acquisition of additional ownership in and consolidation of the operating entity that owns the kfcs in shanghai china and the 2008 gain on the sale of our minority interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate these amounts are further described below 

  

  

 

the company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally this nongaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations excluding items in 2009 and 2008 that the company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size andor nature 

 

 

 

 

  

  

us business transformation measures 

the us business transformation measures in 2008 and 2009 included expansion of our us refranchising a reduced emphasis on multibranding as a longterm growth strategy ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases we do not believe these measures are indicative of our ongoing operations and are not including the impacts of these us business transformation measures in our us segment for performance reporting purposes 

in the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 we recorded a pretax gain of 34 million and a pretax loss of 5 million from refranchising in the us respectively in 2010 we currently expect to refranchise 500 restaurants in the us the impact of this refranchising on our 2010 results will be determined by the stores that we are able to sell and the specific prices we are able to obtain for those stores additionally to the extent we offer to sell a store or group of stores at a loss such loss is recorded at the date we make such offer gains upon refranchising however are not recorded until we consummate the sale this timing difference can create quarterly or annual earnings volatility as decisions are made to refranchise a portfolio of stores 

as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs and aw us businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multibranding we recorded a noncash charge of 26 million which resulted in no related income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 to writeoff goodwill associated with these businesses 

in connection with our ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs we recorded pretax charges of 16 million and 49 million in the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively we realized a 65 million decline in our us ga expenses in the year ended december 26 2009 driven by the us productivity initiatives and realignment of resources measures we took in 2008 and 2009 

additionally the company recognized a reduction to franchise and license fees and income of 32 million pretax in the year ended december 26 2009 related to investments in our us brands these investments reflect our reimbursements to kfc franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of kentucky grilled chicken the reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship in the year ended december 27 2008 the company recognized pretax expense of 7 million related to investments in our us brands in franchise and license expenses 

  

  

consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in shanghai china 

on may 4 2009 we acquired an additional 7 ownership in the entity that operates more than 200 kfcs in shanghai china for 12 million increasing our ownership to 58 this entity has historically been accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition as required by gaap we remeasured our previously held 51 ownership which had a recorded value of 17 million at the date of acquisition in the entity at fair value and recognized a gain of 68 million accordingly this gain which resulted in no related income tax expense was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statements of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 

under the equity method of accounting we previously reported our 51 share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate subsequent to the date of the acquisition we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer record franchise fee income for these restaurants nor do we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting net income attributable to our partner’s ownership percentage is recorded as net incomenoncontrolling interest within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 26 2009 the consolidation of this entity increased company sales by 192 million and decreased franchise and license fees and income by 12 million the consolidation of this entity positively impacted operating profit by 4 million in 2009 the impact on net income – yum brands inc was not significant to the year ended december 26 2009 prior to lapping the acquisition of this entity during the second quarter of 2010 we expect the impact of this transaction to increase the china division’s company sales by approximately 100 million decrease franchise and license fees and income by approximately 6 million and provide a modest increase to operating profit during the first half of 2010 

refranchising of an international equity market 

 

in the third quarter of 2009 we recognized a 10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our kfc taiwan equity market this loss which resulted in no related income tax benefit was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes this market was refranchised on january 31 2010 we are currently evaluating what amount of the 37 million in goodwill associated with kfc taiwan should be written off in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of this refranchising 

sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan 

during the year ended december 27 2008 we recorded a pretax gain of approximately 100 million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan see note 5 for further discussion of this transaction this gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 

  

  

restaurant profit 

the us restaurant margin increased 14 percentage points in 2009 this increase was largely driven by commodity deflation of 28 million and productivity initiatives partially offset by company same store sales declines of 4 additionally our us store portfolio actions including the refranchising of 541 stores during 2009 positively impacted our restaurant margin by 04 percentage points 

our us restaurant margin decreased 08 percentage points in 2008 restaurant profit was negatively impacted by 119 million of commodity inflation for the full year 2008 additionally restaurant profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by 30 million due to higher property and casualty selfinsurance expense exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores as we lapped favorability in 2007 these decreases were partially offset by company same store sales growth of 3 resulting from pricing actions we took 

china division restaurant margin increased 18 percentage points and declined 17 percentage points in 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2009 improvement was largely driven by commodity deflation of 61 million offsetting company same store sales declines 1 commodity inflation of 78 million and higher labor costs partially offset by company same store sales growth of 7 drove the 2008 restaurant margin decline 

  

  

impact of foreign currency translation on operating profit 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated operating profit in our international division by 56 million and positively impacted operating profit in our china division by 10 million for the year ended december 26 2009 in the year ended december 27 2008 our operating profit in our international and china divisions was positively impacted by 9 million and 42 million respectively by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

pizza hut south korea goodwill impairment 

as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our pizza hut south korea market we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 12 million for this market during 2009 this charge was recorded in closure and impairment income expenses in our consolidated statement of income and was allocated to our international division for performance reporting purposes 

consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in beijing china 

in 2008 we began consolidating an entity in which we have a majority ownership interest and that operates the kfcs in beijing china our partners in this entity are essentially stateowned enterprises we historically did not consolidate this entity instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting due to the effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business concurrent with a decision that we made on january 1 2008 regarding top management of the entity we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business in accordance with gaap we began consolidating this entity on that date 

like our other unconsolidated affiliates the accounting for this entity prior to 2008 resulted in royalties being reflected as franchise and license fees and our share of the entity’s net income being reflected in other income expense subsequent to the date of consolidation we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer record franchise fee income for these restaurants nor do we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting net income attributable to our partner’s ownership percentage is recorded as net incomenoncontrolling interest within our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 27 2008 the consolidation of this entity increased the china division’s company sales by approximately 300 million and decreased franchise and license fees and income by approximately 20 million the consolidation of this entity positively impacted operating profit by approximately 20 million in 2008 the positive impact on operating profit was offset by net income – noncontrolling interest of 8 million and a higher income tax provision such that there was no impact on net income – yum brands inc for the year ended december 27 2008 the consolidated statement of income was impacted by similar amounts for the year ended december 26 2009 

  

  

mexico value added tax “vat” exemption 

on october 1 2007 mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to vat payments beginning on january 1 2008 we were required to remit vat on all company restaurant sales resulting in lower company sales and restaurant profit as a result of this new legislation our international division’s company sales and restaurant profit for the year ended december 27 2008 were unfavorably impacted by approximately 38 million and 34 million respectively the international division’s system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by approximately 03 and 12 percentage points respectively for the year ended december 27 2008 the 2009 impact versus 2008 was not significant to our international division’s results of operations 

tax legislation – mainland china 

on march 16 2007 the national people’s congress in mainland china enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on january 1 2008 upon enactment which occurred in the china division’s 2007 second fiscal quarter the deferred tax balances of all chinese entities including our unconsolidated affiliates were adjusted these income tax rate changes positively impacted our 2009 and 2008 net income – yum brands inc by approximately 15 million and 20 million respectively compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted the impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended december 29 2007 were not significant 

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in the us we are targeting company ownership of restaurants potentially below 10 down from its current level of 16 consistent with this strategy 541 700 and 304 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively 

refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of ga declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities

income taxes 

 

 

  

  

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 

 

our 2009 effective tax rate was positively impacted by the yearoveryear change in adjustments to reserves and prior years including certain outofyear adjustments that decreased our effective tax rate by 16 percentage points in 2009 benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations decreased versus prior year as a result of withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends and an increase in tax expense for certain foreign markets these increases were partially offset by lapping a 2008 expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings our 2009 effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the reversal of foreign valuation allowances associated with certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more likely than not to be utilized on future tax returns additionally our rate was lower as a result of lapping the 2008 gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan 

our 2008 effective income tax rate was negatively impacted versus 2007 by lapping valuation allowance reversals made in the prior year as discussed below this negative impact was partially offset by the reversal of foreign valuation allowances in the current year associated with certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more likely than not to be utilized on future tax returns additionally the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the yearoveryear change in adjustments to reserves and prior years including certain outofyear adjustments that increased our effective tax rate by 18 percentage points in 2008 benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations positively impacted the effective tax rate as a result of lapping 2007 expenses associated with the distribution of an intercompany dividend and adjustments to our deferred tax balances that resulted from the mexico tax law change as further discussed below as well as a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the us these benefits were partially offset in 2008 by the gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan and expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings we also recognized deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by certain tax planning strategies implemented in 2008 included in foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations 17 percentage point impact however we provided a full valuation allowance on these assets as we do not believe it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 

our 2007 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals in december 2007 the company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations distributed a 275 million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate as a result in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed approximately 82 million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns in 2007 benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by 36 million of expense associated with the 275 million intercompany dividend and approximately 20 million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

  

adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1404 million compared to 1521 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions partially offset by higher net income 

in 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 1521   million compared to 1551   million in 2007 the decrease was primarily driven by higher interest payments and pension contributions 

net cash used in investing activities was 727 million versus 641 million in 2008 the increase was driven by the acquisition of an interest in little sheep as discussed in note 5 lower proceeds from refranchising and sales of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower capital spending 

in 2008 net cash used in investing activities was 641 million versus 416 million in 2007 the increase was driven by higher capital spending in 2008 and the lapping of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the japan unconsolidated affiliate in 2007 partially offset by the yearoveryear change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants 

in december 2007 we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for 128 million includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 2007 the international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close thus consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period the pretax gain on the sale of this investment of 100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 however the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december 2007 and were thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 29 2007 

net cash used in financing activities was 542 million versus 1459 million in 2008 the decrease was driven by a reduction in share repurchases partially offset by net payments on debt 

in 2008 net cash used in financing activities was 1459 million versus 678 million in 2007 the increase was driven by lower net borrowings higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments in 2008

the acquisition of additional ownership in and consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate that operates the kfcs in shanghai china during 2009 impacted our consolidated balance sheet at december 26 2009 see note 5 for a discussion of this transaction and a summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisition and consolidation

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in each of the last eight fiscal years net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 11 billion we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 

in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders additionally as of december 2009 we had approximately 13 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in 2012 primarily related to a domestic facility 

our china division and yri represent more than 60 of the company’s operating profit and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending including share repurchases dividends and debt repayments we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner as a result of our substantial international development a significant amount of noncash undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries is considered indefinitely reinvested as of december 26 2009 if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 

we are currently managing our cash and debt positions in order to maintain our current investment grade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 as a commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating we improved our capital structure by extending our scheduled debt maturities while reducing our debt outstanding during 2009 additionally we funded 280 million of our unfunded pension obligation and did not repurchase shares of our common stock subsequent to year end we have resumed repurchasing shares of our common stock however we believe we can do so while maintaining a capital structure that allows us to remain an investment grade borrower while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating a downgrade would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 26 2009 which included a minimal amount outstanding under our credit facilities our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2009 we invested 797 million in our businesses including approximately 275 million in the us 232 million for the international division and 290 million for the china division for 2010 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 1 billion 

during the year ended december 26 2009 we paid cash dividends of 362 million additionally on november 20 2009 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 021 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 5 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 15 2010 the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35  40 of net income 

the company did not repurchase shares of our common stock during 2009 as of december 26 2009 we have 300 million excluding applicable transaction fees available for future repurchases under a share repurchase authorization that expires in september 2010 

  

  

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 115 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in november 2012 and includes 23 participating banks with commitments ranging from 20 million to 113 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 26 2009 our unused credit facility totaled 975 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 170 million there were borrowings of 5 million outstanding under the credit facility at december 26 2009 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 025 to 125 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or is determined by an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

we also have a 350 million syndicated revolving credit facility the “international credit facility” or “icf” which matures in november 2012 and includes 6 banks with commitments ranging from 35 million to 90 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank there was available credit of 350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of 2009 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 031 to 150 over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

the credit facility and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries additionally the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 26 2009 with a considerable amount of cushion 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2011 through 2037 and stated interest rates ranging from 425 to 888 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes reflecting the events described below were 29 billion at december 26 2009 

during the second quarter of 2009 we repurchased senior unsecured notes due july 1 2012 with an aggregate principal amount of 137 million 

in august 2009 we issued 250 million aggregate principal amount of 425 senior unsecured notes that are due in september 2015 and 250 million aggregate principal amount of 530 senior unsecured notes that are due in september 2019 we used the proceeds from our issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay a variable rate senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 375 million that was scheduled to mature in 2011 and to make discretionary payments to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of 2009 

our senior unsecured notes credit facility and icf all contain crossdefault provisions whereby a default under any of these agreements constitutes a default under each of the other agreements 

  

  

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 26 2009 included 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 264 million for longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 

we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees the most significant of which are in the us and uk the most significant of these plans the yum retirement plan the “plan” is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan’s funded status at december 26 2009 the plan was in a net underfunded position of 83 million based on the current funding status of the plan we will not be required to make minimum contributions in 2010 investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions beyond 2010 

  

  

the uk pension plans are in a net underfunded position of 29 million at our 2009 measurement date we have committed to making discretionary funding contributions of 15 million to one of these plans in 2010 and this amount is included in our contractual obligations table above 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 6 million in 2009 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 15 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee healthcare longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately 15 million of a franchisee loan program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s historical refranchising programs at december 26 2009 we have also provided two letters of credit totaling approximately 23 million in support of the franchisee loan program one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee the other letter of credit could be used in certain circumstances to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were 54 million at december 26 2009 

our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately 40 million and 50 million of debt outstanding as of december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed in the reconciliation for level 3 fair value measurements separate disclosures are required for purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the company the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2010 

in june 2009 the fasb issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets requiring more information about transfers of financial assets eliminating the qualifying special purpose entity concept changing the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requiring additional disclosures the fasb also issued guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity that modifies the methods allowed for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest entity the adoption of this guidance may require the company to consolidate an entity that provides loans used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s historical refranchising programs if consolidation of this entity is required the company’s longterm debt will increase by approximately 54 million with a corresponding increase to receivables see note 21 for additional information regarding this franchisee loan program this guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november 15 2009 our fiscal 2010 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets of restaurants primarily ppe and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization that are currently operating and have not been offered for refranchise semiannually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants for restaurant assets that are not deemed to be recoverable we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the aftertax cash flows and discount rate the aftertax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if there is an expectation that we will refranchise the restaurants as a group these impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer if available or anticipated bids given the discounted projected aftertax cash flows for the restaurant or group of restaurants the aftertax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets historically these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we have certain definitelived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant such as the ljs and aw trademarkbrand intangible assets and franchise contract rights which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 

these definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted aftertax cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definitelived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property plant and equipment 

  

  

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using discounted expected future aftertax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit the assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

except for the ljsawus and pizza hut south korea reporting units discussed below the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value as of the 2009 goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter yum recorded goodwill impairment charges of 26 million and 12 million for our ljsawus and pizza hut south korea reporting units respectively as the carrying value of these reporting units exceeded their fair values the fair value of the ljsawus reporting unit was based on our discounted expected aftertax cash flows from the future royalty stream net of ga expected to be earned from the underlying franchise agreements these cash flows incorporated a decline in future profit expectations for our ljsawus reporting unit which were due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multibranding as a longterm us growth strategy the fair value of the pizza hut south korea reporting unit was based on the discounted expected aftertax future cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties for this reporting unit our expectations of aftertax cash flows for this business were negatively impacted by recent profit declines for this reporting unit 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

  

  

allowances for franchise and license receivablesguarantees 

franchise and license receivable balances include royalties initial fees as well as other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon predefined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december 26 2009 as such we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december 26 2009 

we have historically issued certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1 assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 2 facilitating franchisee development and 3 equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification such as renewals when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 

the potential total exposure for lease assignments is significant when aggregated with approximately 425 million representing the present value discounted at our pretax cost of debt of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 26 2009 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases additionally we have guaranteed approximately 40 million of franchisee loans of various equipment programs we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under assigned leases and certain of the equipment loan programs we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and historically we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees at december 26 2009 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 21 for a further discussion of our guarantees 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

  

  

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the underfunded status of 175 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 26 2009 these us plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 1010 million and a fair value of plan assets of 835 million at december 26 2009 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo’s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbo using a discount rate of 63 at december 26 2009 this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year the weightedaverage yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary   a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 73 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 84 million at our measurement date 

the pension expense we will record in 2010 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately 2 million to 41 million in 2010 the increase is primarily driven by increases in amortization of net loss and interest costs partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets due to increases in the plan assets balance during 2009 a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2010 us pension expense by approximately 13 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets for purposes of determining 2010 pension expense at december 26 2009 was 775 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our 2010 us pension plan expense by approximately 9 million 

the losses our us plan assets have experienced along with a decrease in discount rates over time have largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax net loss of 346 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 26 2009 for purposes of determining 2009 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 13 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 23 million of such loss in 2010 

see note 15 for further discussion of our pension and postretirement plans 

  

  

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our specific weightedaverage assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 16 additionally we estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically approximately 10  15 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis based on the results of this analysis we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives respectively 

upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 50 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 25 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

income taxes 

at december 26 2009 we had a valuation allowance of 187 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of 230 million as well as our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage including approximately 110 million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 26 2009 we had 301 million of unrecognized tax benefits 259 million of which if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not recorded the deferred tax impact for certain undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling approximately 875 million at december 26 2009 as we believe these amounts are indefinitely reinvested if our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

at december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 3 million and 9 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 would decrease approximately 20 million and 27 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 would decrease approximately 181 million and 120 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute more than 60 of our operating profit in 2009 excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 26 billion as of december 26 2009 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 26 2009 operating profit would have decreased approximately 120 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

general 

yum is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on number of system units with more than 36000 units in more than 110 countries and territories through the five concepts of kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items the company either operates units or they are operated by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one unit to large publicly traded companies in addition the company owns noncontrolling interests in unconsolidated affiliates in china who operate similar to franchisees 

  

  

at year end 2008 we had approximately 20000 system restaurants in the us which achieved revenues of 51 billion and operating profit of 694 million during 2008 the international division based in dallas texas comprises approximately 13000 system restaurants primarily kfcs and pizza huts operating in over 110 countries outside the us in 2008 yri achieved revenues of 30 billion and operating profit of 528 million the china division based in shanghai china comprises approximately 3600 system restaurants predominately kfcs in 2008 the china division achieved revenues of 31 billion and operating profit of 469 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell kfc ljs and aw offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building and equipment and purchasing signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit at year end 2008 there were 4958 multibranded units in the worldwide system of which 4629 were in the us these units were comprised of 2751 units offering food products from two of the concepts 40 units offering food products from three of the concepts and 2167 units offering food products from pizza hut and wingstreet a flavored chicken wings concept

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

the company’s restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in the us the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis we issue detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit the company’s restaurants from time to time to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members

us division the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw franchisee groups are members in the unified foodservice purchasing coop llc the “unified coop” which was created for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the us the core mission of the unified coop is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment while ensuring compliance with certain quality and safety standards this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the company and franchisee restaurants in the us which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that the unified coop has resulted and should continue to result in closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forwardlooking statements and historical trends these risks are not exclusive and our business and our results of operations could also be affected by other risks that we cannot anticipate or that we do not consider material based on currently available information 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past see note 21 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of litigation arising from an e coli outbreak allegedly linked to a number of taco bell restaurants in the northeast us during novemberdecember 2006 and could occur in the future any report or publicity linking us or one of our concepts to instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues including food tampering could adversely affect our concepts’ brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants in addition instances of foodborne illness or food tampering occurring solely at restaurants of competitors could adversely affect our sales as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally foodborne illness or food tampering could also be caused by food suppliers or distributors and as a result could be out of our control the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients which could result in disruptions in our supply chain andor lower margins for us and our franchisees 

furthermore like other companies in the restaurant industry some of our products may contain genetically engineered food products and our us suppliers are currently not required to label their products as such increased regulation of and opposition to genetically engineered food products have on occasion and may in the future force the use of alternative sources at increased costs and lower margins for us and our franchisees 

our china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located in china as a result our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including wage and commodity inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  

  

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china although management believes it has structured our china operations to comply with local laws there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

our other foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated in foreign countries and territories outside of the us and china and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by market include political instability corruption social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including wage and commodity inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels the regulatory environment tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated 

in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings more specifically an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies such as the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

any increase in certain commodity prices such as food energy and supply costs could adversely affect our operating results because we provide moderately priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers may be limited significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our business our operating expenses also include employee benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time 

shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues 

 

we are dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods drought and hurricanes increased demand problems in production or distribution the inability of our vendors to obtain credit food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements such as reports during 2008 relating to tomatoes and jalapenos in the us or other conditions beyond our control a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations in addition if a principal distributor for us andor our franchisees fails to meet its service requirements for any reason it could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

  

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

 

we receive significant revenues in the form of royalties from our franchisees because a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are run by franchisees the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees while our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines we have limited control over how our franchisees’ businesses are run and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments for example franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us in addition franchisees may not be able to find suitable sites on which to develop new restaurants or negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 

in addition although in certain instances we require franchisees to meet certain financial criteria on an ongoing basis or in order to grow franchisees levels of indebtedness are generally not within our control if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt it could result in financial distress or even possible insolvency or bankruptcy if a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed this could harm our operating results through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 

our results and financial condition could be affected by the success of our refranchising program 

 

we are in the process of a refranchising program which could reduce the percentage of company ownership in the us excluding licensees from approximately 19 at the end of 2008 to potentially less than 10 by the end of 2010 our ability to execute this plan will depend on among other things whether we receive fair offers for our restaurants whether we can find viable and suitable buyers and how quickly we can agree to terms with potential buyers in addition some lenders have increased lending requirements or otherwise reduced the amount of loans they are making generally or to the restaurant industry in particular to the extent potential buyers are unable to obtain financing at attractive prices – or unable to obtain financing at any price – our refranchising program could be delayed 

once executed the success of the refranchising program will depend on among other things selection of buyers who can effectively operate our restaurants our ability to limit our exposure to contingent liabilities in connection with the sale of our restaurants and whether the resulting ownership mix of companyoperated and franchiseeoperated restaurants allows us to meet our financial objectives in addition refranchising activity could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and that volatility could impact our reported earnings 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant money damages and other remedies 

 

like others in the restaurant industry we are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a judgment for significant monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

  

  

health concerns arising from outbreaks of avian flu may have an adverse effect on our business 

asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels while fullycooked chicken has been determined to be safe for consumption and while we have taken and continue to take measures to prepare for and minimize the effect of these outbreaks on our business future outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to eat less chicken in addition outbreaks on a widespread basis could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

we may not attain our target development goals 

 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the united states the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open new restaurants upgrade existing restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new upgraded or converted restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any restaurant we open or convert will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations obtain required permits and approvals and hire and train qualified personnel 

our franchisees also frequently depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants disruptions in credit markets may make financing more difficult or expensive to obtain if it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants our planned growth could slow and our future revenue and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

our business may be adversely impacted by economic conditions 

 

our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers which may be affected by general economic conditions and the current global financial crisis worldwide economic conditions and consumer spending have recently deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed for some time some of the factors that are having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include increased unemployment reductions in disposable income as a result of recent severe market declines and declines in residential real estate values credit availability and consumer confidence these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales and development plans which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

in addition the current financial crisis has resulted in diminished liquidity and credit availability and the recent or future turmoil in the financial markets could make it more difficult for us to refinance our existing indebtedness if necessary or incur additional indebtedness and could impact the ability of banks to honor draws on our existing credit facilities 

the current credit crisis is also having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world and the impact of this crisis on our suppliers cannot be predicted the inability of suppliers to access financing or the insolvency of suppliers could lead to disruptions in our supply chain which could adversely impact our sales and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

 

we and our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food workplace safety fire and other agencies requirements of local authorities with respect to zoning land use licensing permitting and environmental standards could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly complex federal and state immigration laws and regulations 

  

  

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we also face risks from new or changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling regulation compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor in addition we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development price advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees which could adversely impact our margins

strategies 

the company continues to focus on four key strategies 

build leading brands in china in every significant category – the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants respectively in mainland china additionally the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage given this strong competitive position a rapidly growing economy and a population of 13 billion in mainland china the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of pizza hut home service pizza delivery and east dawning chinese food our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual systemsales growth of 20 in mainland china driven by new unit development each year which we expect to drive annual operating profit growth of 20 in the china division 

drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere – the company and its franchisees opened over 900 new restaurants in 2008 in the company’s international division representing 9 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants the international division generated 528 million in operating profit in 2008 up from 186 million in 1998 the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india france and russia our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual operating profit growth of 10 driven by new unit development and same store sales growth for the international division new unit development is expected to contribute to system sales growth of at least 6 each year 

dramatically improve us brand positions consistency and returns – the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience the company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts we are the leader in multibranding with more than 4600 restaurants providing customers two or more of our brands at a single location we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on company owned restaurants our ongoing earnings growth model calls for annual operating profit growth of 5 in the us with same store sales growth of 2 to 3 and leverage of our general and administrative “ga” infrastructure

2008 highlights 

  

 

significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results 

the following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended december 27 2008 december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 and could impact comparability with our results in 2009 

us restaurant profit 

our us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 08 percentage points in 2008 and decreased 13 percentage points in 2007 these decreases were the primary drivers in the us operating profit declines of 6 and 3 for the years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively 

restaurant profit in dollar terms was negatively impacted by 119 million of commodity inflation for the full year 2008 additionally restaurant profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by 30 million due to higher property and casualty self insurance expense exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores as we lapped favorability in 2007 these decreases were partially offset by company same store sales growth of 3 resulting from pricing actions we have taken 

in 2007 restaurant profit was negatively impacted versus 2006 by company same store sales declines of 3 primarily due to taco bell and 44 million of commodity inflation this unfavorability was partially offset by 27 million of lower selfinsured property and casualty insurance expense exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores driven by improved loss trends 

we anticipate that the us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales will improve approximately 1 for the full year 2009 as a result of pricing actions we have taken and the moderation of commodity inflation 

china restaurant profit 

china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was 184 201 and 204 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the declines in 2008 and 2007 were driven by commodity inflation primarily chicken of approximately 78 million and 34 million respectively and higher labor costs the decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin in the china division we expect that commodity inflation will moderate as 2009 progresses and restaurant margin will be at least flat versus 2008 

impact of foreign currency translation on operating profit 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated operating profit in our international and china divisions by 9 million and 41 million respectively for the year ended december 27 2008 and 24 million and 19 million respectively for the year ended december 29 2007 in 2009 we currently expect foreign currency translation to have a significant negative impact on our reported international division operating profit and no significant impact on our reported china division operating profit given the nature and volatility of the foreign currency markets the full year forecasted foreign currency impact is difficult to quantify however for the first quarter of 2009 we currently expect a 20 million negative impact on yri’s operating profit and a similar impact for the second quarter of 2009 

  

  

consolidation   of   a   former   unconsolidated   affiliate   in   china 

in 2008 we began consolidating an entity in which we have a majority ownership interest and that operates the kfcs in beijing china our partners in this entity are essentially stateowned enterprises we historically did not consolidate this entity instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting due to the effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business as addressed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9616 investors accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights concurrent with a decision that we made on january 1 2008 regarding top management of the entity we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business accordingly we began consolidating this entity 

like our other unconsolidated affiliates the accounting for this entity prior to 2008 resulted in royalties being reflected as franchise and license fees and our share of the entity’s net income being reflected in other income expense the impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 27 2008 as a result of our consolidation of this entity was as follows 

 

the impact on other income expense includes both the current year minority interest in pretax earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate as well as the reduction in other income expense that resulted from our share of aftertax earnings no longer being reported in other income expense the increase in operating profit was offset by a corresponding increase in income tax provision such that there was no impact to net income 

significant gains and charges 

as part of our plan to transform our us business we took several measures in 2008 that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations these measures “the us business transformation measures” included expansion of our us refranchising potentially reducing our company ownership in the us to below 10 by year end 2010 charges relating to ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases as discussed in note 5 we are not including the impacts of these us business transformation measures in our us segment for performance reporting purposes 

in the year ended december 27 2008 we recorded a pretax loss of 5 million from refranchising in the us pretax expense related to us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources of 49 million and pretax expense related to investments in our us brands of 7 million the refranchising losses are more fully discussed in note 5 and the store portfolio strategy of the mda 

these losses were more than offset in the year ended december 27 2008 by a pretax gain of approximately 100 million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan see note 5 for further discussion of this transaction this gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 

  

  

in 2009 we currently expect to refranchise 500 restaurants in the us the impact of this refranchising on our 2009 results will be determined by the stores that we are able to sell and the specific prices we are able to obtain for those stores in the first quarter of 2009 the expenses related to the us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources are expected to total approximately 5 million and investments in our us brands are expected to total approximately 25 million 

we currently anticipate ongoing ga savings of approximately 70 million primarily within the us segment as a result of the us business transformation measures we took in 2008 and will take in 2009 

mexico value added tax “vat” exemption 

on october 1 2007 mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to vat payments beginning on january 1 2008 we were required to remit vat on all company restaurant sales resulting in lower company sales and restaurant profit as a result of this new legislation our international division’s company sales and restaurant profit for the year ended december 27 2008 were unfavorably impacted by approximately 38 million and 34 million respectively the international division’s system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by approximately 03 and 12 percentage points respectively for the year ended december 27 2008 for the first quarter of 2009 the negative lapping impact is expected to be 4 million after which there will be no impact on subsequent quarters in 2009 

tax legislation – mainland china 

on march 16 2007 the national people’s congress in mainland china enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on january 1 2008 upon enactment which occurred in the china division’s 2007 second fiscal quarter the deferred tax balances of all chinese entities including our unconsolidated affiliates were adjusted these income tax rate changes positively impacted our 2008 net income by approximately 20 million compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted the impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended december 29 2007 were not significant 

pizza hut united kingdom acquisition 

on september 12 2006 we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom “uk” unconsolidated affiliate from our partner paying approximately 178 million in cash including transaction costs and net of 9 million of cash assumed additionally we assumed the full liability as opposed to our fifty percent share associated with the pizza hut uk’s capital leases of 97 million and shortterm borrowings of 23 million this unconsolidated affiliate operated more than 500 restaurants in the uk at the date of acquisition 

prior to the acquisition we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting thus we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate since the date of the acquisition we have reported company sales and the associated restaurant costs ga expense interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer record franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate nor do we report other income under the equity method of accounting as a result of this acquisition company sales and restaurant profit increased 576 million and 59 million respectively franchise fees decreased 19 million and ga expenses increased 33 million in the year ended december 29 2007 compared to the year ended december 30 2006 

  

  

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in the us we are targeting company ownership of restaurants potentially below 10 by year end 2010 down from its current level of 19 consistent with this strategy 700 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in 2008 we recorded net refranchising losses of 5 million in the us for the year ended december 27 2008 primarily due to our refranchising of or our offers to sell certain stores or groups of stores for a price less than their carrying values we currently anticipate refranchising 500 units in the us in 2009 

we expect us refranchising will generate the following financial impacts over the threeyear period 20082010 pretax sales proceeds of about 1 billion us restaurant margin improvement of about 25 percentage points neutral to slightly dilutive to us operating profit and net refranchising gains of about 150 million 

while it remains our intent to significantly reduce our ownership levels of pizza huts in the uk through refranchising minimal activity took place in 2008 the timing of future refranchising is currently difficult to predict given refranchising results to date and the current economic environment 

refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of such declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities 

 

 

 

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and ga expenses and b the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year in these tables decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year increased franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year

company restaurant margins 

 

 

 

in 2008 the decrease in us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of higher commodity costs primarily cheese meat chicken and wheat costs higher labor costs primarily wage rate and salary increases and higher property and casualty insurance expense as we lapped favorability recognized in 2007 the decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin including the impact of higher average guest check 

in 2007 the decrease in us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of higher commodity costs primarily cheese and meats and higher wage rates due primarily to state minimum wage rate increases the decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower selfinsured property and casualty insurance expense driven by improved loss trends as well as the favorable impact on restaurant margin of refranchising and closing certain restaurants 

in 2008 the decrease in yri restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the elimination of a vat exemption in mexico an increase in commodity costs was partially offset by higher average guest check 

in 2007 the increase in yri restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin as well as the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants the increase was almost fully offset by higher labor costs primarily wage rates and the impact of lower margins associated with pizza hut units in the uk which we now operate as a percentage of sales pizza hut uk restaurants negatively impacted payroll and employee benefits and occupancy and other expenses and positively impacted food and paper   

  

in 2008 the decrease in china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by higher commodity costs primarily chicken products the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation and higher labor costs the decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin 

in 2007 the decrease in china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by higher commodity costs primarily chicken products the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation and higher labor costs the decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin 

worldwide general and administrative expenses 

ga expenses increased 4 in 2008 including a 1 unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation this increase was driven by approximately 49 million of ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources related to the us transformation as discussed in the significant gains  charges section of this mda 

ga expenses increased 9 in 2007 including a 2 unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation excluding the additional ga expenses associated with acquiring the pizza hut uk business which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ga expense increased 4 the increase was driven by higher annual incentive and other compensation costs including amounts associated with strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets 

worldwide franchise and license expenses 

franchise and license expenses increased 86 in 2008 the increase was driven by higher marketing funding on behalf of franchisees investments in our us brands as discussed in the significant gains  charges section of this mda and increased provision for uncollectible receivables 

franchise and license expenses increased 14 in 2007 the increase was driven by higher marketing funding on behalf of franchisees franchise convention costs and increased provision for uncollectible receivables

see the store portfolio strategy section for more detail of our refranchising activity and note 5 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment 

operating profit 

 

us operating profit decreased 6 in 2008 the decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs and higher closure and impairment expenses partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit primarily due to higher average guest check and franchise and license fees the increase in restaurant operating costs was primarily driven by higher commodity costs 

us operating profit decreased 3 in 2007 the decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs principally commodities and labor partially offset by lower ga expenses lower closure and impairment expenses and an increase in other income 

yri operating profit increased 10 in 2008 including a 2 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and net unit development on franchise and license fees these increases were partially offset by the loss of the vat exemption in mexico 

  

  

yri operating profit increased 18 in 2007 including a 6 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees the increase was partially offset by higher ga expenses including expenses which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the pizza hut uk business and higher restaurant operating costs 

china division operating profit increased 25 and 30 in 2008 and 2007 respectively including an 11 and 7 favorable impact from foreign currency translation respectively the increases were driven by the impact of same store sales growth and net unit development on restaurant profit the increases were partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and higher ga expenses 

unallocated and corporate expenses increased 19 in 2008 due to us ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources and investments in the us brands as discussed in the significant gains and charges section of this mda partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation expenses the 12 increase in unallocated and corporate expenses in 2007 was driven by an increase in annual incentive compensation and project costs 

unallocated other income expense in 2008 includes a 100 million gain recognized on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan see note 5 

interest expense net 

 

 

 

 

net interest expense increased 60 million or 36 in 2008 the increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by a decrease in interest rates in the variable portion of our debt as compared to prior year 

net interest expense increased 12 million or 8 in 2007 the increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2007 compared to 2006 partially offset by an increase in interest bearing cash equivalents in 2007 compared to 2006 

income taxes 

 

 

 

  

  

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 

 

our 2008 effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by lapping valuation allowance reversals made in the prior year as discussed below this negative impact was partially offset by the reversal of foreign valuation allowances in the current year associated with certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more likely than not to be utilized on future tax returns additionally the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the yearoveryear change in adjustments to reserves and prior years including certain outofyear adjustments that increased our effective tax rate by 18 percentage points in 2008 benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations positively impacted the effective tax rate as a result of lapping 2007 expenses associated with the distribution of an intercompany dividend and adjustments to our deferred tax balances that resulted from the mexico tax law change as further discussed below as well as a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the us these benefits were partially offset in 2008 by the gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan and expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings we also recognized deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by certain tax planning strategies implemented in 2008 included in foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations 17 percentage point impact however we provided a full valuation allowance on these assets as we do not believe it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 

our 2007 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals in december 2007 the company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations distributed a 275 million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate as a result in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed approximately 82 million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns in 2007 benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by 36 million of expense associated with the 275 million intercompany dividend and approximately 20 million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of 2007 these negative impacts were partially offset by a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the us additionally the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the yearoveryear change in adjustments to reserves and prior years 

our 2006 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular us audit cycle as well as certain outofyear adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by 22 percentage points the reversal of tax reserves was partially offset by valuation allowance additions on foreign tax credits for which as a result of the tax reserve reversals we believed were not likely to be utilized before they expired we also recognized deferred tax assets for the foreign tax credit impact of nonrecurring decisions to repatriate certain foreign earnings in 2007 however we provided full valuation allowances on such assets as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized at that time   

  

adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1521 million compared to 1551 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily driven by higher interest payments and pension contributions 

in 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was 1551   million compared to 1257   million in 2006 the increase was driven by higher net income lower pension contributions and lower income tax payments in 2007 

net cash used in investing activities was 641 million versus 416 million in 2007 the increase was driven by higher capital spending in 2008 and the lapping of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the japan unconsolidated affiliate in 2007 partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants 

in december 2007 we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for 128 million includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 2007 the international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close thus consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period the pretax gain on the sale of this investment of 100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 however the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december 2007 and were thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 29 2007 the offset to this cash on our consolidated balance sheet at december 29 2007 was in accounts payable and other current liabilities 

in 2007 net cash used in investing activities was 416 million versus 434 million in 2006 the decrease was driven by the lapping of the acquisition of the remaining interest in our pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate in 2006 and proceeds from the sale of our interest in the japan unconsolidated affiliate in december 2007 partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and a 2007 increase in capital spending 

net cash used in financing activities was 1459 million versus 678 million in 2007 the increase was driven by lower net borrowings higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments in 2008 

in 2007 net cash used in financing activities was 678 million versus 670 million in 2006 the increase was driven by higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments partially offset by an increase in net borrowings 

consolidated financial condition 

upon recognition of the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan as described above during the first quarter 2008 accounts payable and other current liabilities decreased by 128 million due to the reversal of the associated deferred gain 

in may 2008 250 million of senior unsecured notes matured and the repayment was funded with additional borrowings under our credit facility which are included in longterm debt   

  

during 2008 our shareholders’ equity decreased approximately 12 billion resulting in the company ending the year with a shareholders’ deficit this decrease was primarily driven by our shareholder payouts of approximately 2 billion through share buybacks and dividends a decline in the unrecognized funded status of our us pension plans of approximately 200 million and approximately 200 million of foreign currency translation adjustments during the year due to the strengthening of the us dollar these declines were partially offset by the company’s net income for the year ended december 27 2008 a recorded shareholders’ deficit under generally accepted accounting principles does not by itself preclude us from paying dividends to our shareholders or repurchasing shares of our common stock 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in each of the last seven fiscal years net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 11 billion we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future additionally we estimate that refranchising proceeds prior to income taxes will total at least 250 million in 2009 however unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized or our refranchising proceeds from those amounts expected 

in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our longterm business prospects our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders additionally as of december 2008 we had approximately 1 billion in unused capacity under revolving credit facilities that expire in 2012 given this available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities our debt maturity schedule and our ability to reduce discretionary spending we do not believe we will need to access the credit markets during 2009 to help ensure that we do not need to access the credit markets while continuing to build our liquidity and maintaining our financial flexibility we do not currently plan to repurchase shares in 2009 

additionally we are managing our cash and debt positions in order to maintain our current investment grade ratings from standard  poor’s rating services bbb and moody’s investors service baa3 a downgrade of our credit rating would increase the company’s current borrowing costs and could impact the company’s ability to access the credit markets if necessary based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 27 2008 our interest expense would increase approximately 13 million on a full year basis should we receive a onelevel downgrade in our ratings 

discretionary spending 

during 2008 we invested 935 million in our businesses including approximately 355 million in the us 260 million for the international division and 320 million for the china division for 2009 we estimate capital spending will be approximately 900 million 

we returned approximately 2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends in 2008 this is the fourth straight year that we returned over 11 billion to our shareholders under the authority of our board of directors we repurchased 468 million shares of our common stock for 16 billion during 2008 as mentioned above the company does not currently plan to repurchase shares during 2009 

during the year ended december 27 2008 we paid cash dividends of 322 million additionally on november 21 2008 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 19 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 6 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 16 2009 the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35  40 of net income   

  

borrowing capacity 

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 115 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in november 2012 and includes 23 participating banks with commitments ranging from 20 million to 113 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 27 2008 our unused credit facility totaled 685 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 166 million there were borrowings of 299 million outstanding under the credit facility at december 27 2008 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 025 to 125 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or is determined by an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

we also have a 350 million syndicated revolving credit facility the “international credit facility” or “icf” which matures in november 2012 and includes 6 banks with commitments ranging from 35 million to 90 million we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank there was available credit of 350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of 2008 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 031 to 150 over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

on july 11 2008 we entered into a variable rate senior unsecured term loan “domestic term loan” in an aggregate principal amount of 375 million that matures in three years at our discretion the variable rate resets at one two three or six month intervals we determine whether the variable rate at each reset date is based upon 1 libor plus an applicable spread of up to 25 or 2 an alternative base rate the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 plus an applicable spread of up to 15 the proceeds from the domestic term loan were used for general corporate purposes 

the credit facility domestic term loan and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries additionally the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement given the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 27 2008 with a considerable amount of cushion 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2011 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 625 to 888 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 26 billion at december 27 2008 in may 2008 250 million of senior unsecured notes matured and the repayment was funded with additional borrowings under our credit facility   

  

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 27 2008 included 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 229 million for longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow we have included in the contractual obligations table 53 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in cash in the next year 

we have included 85 million in contributions we expect to make to our pension plans in 2009 in the contractual obligations table our most significant plan the yum retirement plan the “us plan” is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain fulltime us salaried employees our funding policy with respect to the us plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements including requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 plus such additional amounts from time to time as determined to be appropriate to improve the us plan’s funded status we currently estimate that we will contribute approximately 80 million to the us plan in 2009 contributions beyond 2009 will depend upon the timing and amount of our asset returns as well as changes in applicable discount rates at our 2008 measurement date our pension plans in the us which include the us plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan had a projected benefit obligation of 923 million and plan assets of 513 million   

  

the funding rules for our pension plans outside of the us vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates performance of plan assets local laws and regulations our most significant plans are in the uk the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans in the uk exceeded plan assets by 43 million at our 2008 measurement date we have committed to make a discretionary funding contribution of approximately 5 million in 2009 to one of these plans the plans are currently under review to determine if additional discretionary pension funding payments will be committed to in 2009 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 5 million in 2008 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table see note 15 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability product liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims 

the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee healthcare longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately 16 million of a franchisee loan program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and to a lesser extent in connection with the company’s historical refranchising programs at december 27 2008 we have also provided two letters of credit totaling approximately 23 million in support of the franchisee loan program one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee the other letter of credit could be used in certain circumstances to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were approximately 48 million at december 27 2008 

our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately 51 million and 22 million of debt outstanding as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further details of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows   

  

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we evaluate our restaurant assets and certain definitelived intangible assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group impairment evaluations for individual restaurants that we are currently operating and have not offered for sale are performed on a semiannual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant our semiannual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our semiannual impairment evaluations require an estimation of forecasted cash flows of the restaurant and any terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 

if the longlived assets of a restaurant subject to our semiannual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows we write the assets down to their fair value this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted after tax cash flows including terminal value of the restaurant the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a restaurant or groups of restaurants and its related longlived assets the discount rate incorporates observed rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and we believe it is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform such impairment evaluations at the group level these impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

we have certain definitelived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant such as the ljs and aw trademarkbrand intangible assets and franchise contract rights which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 

these definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definitelived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using either discounted expected future cash flows from operations or the present value of the estimated future franchise royalty stream plus any estimated sales proceeds from refranchising   

  

future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit future cash flows are based on our growth expectations relative to recent historical performance these growth expectations are based on assumptions for key performance indicators such as company sales franchise and license fees and restaurant profit and are consistent with our internal operating plans the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a thirdparty buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

we have two international reporting units that have experienced deteriorating operating performance over the past few years these reporting units have goodwill of 100 million and 36 million as of the end of 2008 the assumptions used in determining fair value for these reporting units reflect our belief that the businesses are experiencing temporary declines and that they will turn around while these growth assumptions are consistent with our internal operating plans and reflect what we believe are reasonable and achievable growth rates failure to realize these growth rates could result in future impairment of some or all of the recorded goodwill likewise if we believe the risks inherent in the businesses increase the resulting change in the discount rate could result in future impairment of some or all of the recorded goodwill 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 

allowances for franchise and license receivableslease guarantees 

we reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon predefined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due as a result of reserving using this methodology we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december 27 2008 

we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants such guarantees are subject to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” “sfas 145” we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 

if payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees at december 27 2008 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable the potential total exposure under such leases is significant with approximately 325 million representing the present value discounted at our pretax cost of debt of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 27 2008 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and historically we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 14 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees   

  

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

 

see note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the underfunded status of 410 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 27 2008 these us plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 923 million and a fair value of plan assets of 513 million at december 27 2008 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo’s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbo using a discount rate of 65 at december 27 2008 this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody’s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary   a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 64 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 74 million at our measurement dates 

the pension expense we will record in 2009 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately 3 million to 39 million in 2009 the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2009 us pension expense by approximately 12 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets at december 27 2008 was 80 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our 2009 us pension plan expense by approximately 7 million   

  

the losses our us plan assets have experienced along with a decrease in discount rates over time have largely contributed to an unrecognized pretax net loss of 374 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 27 2008 for purposes of determining 2008 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 6 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 13 million of such loss in 2009 

see note 15 for further discussion of our pension and postretirement plans 

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our specific weightedaverage assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 16 additionally under sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased compensation” “sfas 123r” we are required to estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically approximately 15  20 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by sfas 123r we revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis based on the results of this analysis we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives 

upon each stock award grant we revaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 50 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 20 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

income taxes 

at december 27 2008 we had a valuation allowance of 254 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of 256 million as well as our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage including approximately 150 million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

  

  

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities effective december 31 2006 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 27 2008 we had 296 million of unrecognized tax benefits 225 million of which if recognized would affect the effective tax rate since adopting fin 48 we have evaluated unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

additionally we have not recorded the deferred tax impact for certain undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling approximately 11 billion at december 27 2008 as we believe these amounts are indefinitely reinvested if our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

at december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 9 million and 3 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 would decrease approximately 35 million and 31 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 would decrease approximately 120 million and 173 million respectively fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately 60 of our operating profit in 2008 excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 21 billion as of december 27 2008 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 27 2008 operating profit would have decreased 109 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors

this form 10k should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements on pages 47 through 48 

 

in january 1997 pepsico announced its decision to spinoff its restaurant businesses to shareholders as an independent public company the “spinoff” effective october 6 1997 pepsico disposed of its restaurant businesses by distributing all of the outstanding shares of common stock of yum to its shareholders

yum consists of six operating segments kfcus pizza hutus taco bellus ljsawus yum restaurants international “yri” or “international division” and yum restaurants china “china division” for financial reporting purposes management considers the four us operating segments to be similar and therefore has aggregated them into a single reportable operating segment the china division includes mainland china “china” thailand and kfc taiwan and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations 

operating segment information for the years ended december 29 2007 december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 for the company is included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” in part ii item 7 pages 21 through 48 and in the related consolidated financial statements and footnotes in part ii item 8 pages 49 through 101 

 

general 

yum is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on number of system units with more than 35000 units in more than 100 countries and territories through the five concepts of kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw the “concepts” the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items in all five of its concepts the company either operates units or they are operated by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one unit to large publicly traded companies in addition the company owns noncontrolling interests in unconsolidated affiliates who operate similar to franchisees 

  

  

at year end 2007 we had approximately 20000 system restaurants in the us which generated revenues of 52 billion and operating profit of 739 million during 2007 the international division based in dallas texas comprises more than 12000 system restaurants primarily kfcs and pizza huts operating in over 100 countries outside the us in 2007 yri achieved revenues of 31 billion and operating profit of 480 million the china division based in shanghai china comprises more than 3000 system restaurants predominately kfcs in 2007 the china division achieved revenues of 21 billion and operating profit of 375 million 

restaurant concepts 

most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell kfc ljs and aw offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building and equipment and purchasing signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including products equipment operational improvements and standards and management techniques 

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit at year end 2007 there were 3989 multibranded units in the worldwide system of which 3699 were in the us these units were comprised of 2703 units offering food products from two of the concepts 47 units offering food products from three of the concepts and 1216 units offering food products from pizza hut and wingstreet a flavored chicken wings concept yum has 23 units offering food products from kfc and wing works another flavored chicken wings concept developed by yum

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

the company’s restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in the us the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis we issue detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants various senior operators visit the company’s restaurants from time to time to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

supply and distribution 

the company is a substantial purchaser of a number of food and paper products equipment and other restaurant supplies the principal items purchased include chicken cheese beef and pork products seafood paper and packaging materials 

  

  

us division the company along with the representatives of the company’s kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw franchisee groups are members in the unified foodservice purchasing coop llc the “unified coop” which was created for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the us the core mission of the unified coop is to provide the lowest possible sustainable storedelivered prices for restaurant products and equipment while ensuring compliance with certain quality and safety standards this arrangement combines the purchasing power of the company and franchisee restaurants in the us which the company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function the company also believes that the unified coop has resulted and should continue to result in closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community 

the company is committed to conducting its business in an ethical legal and socially responsible manner to encourage compliance with all legal requirements and ethical business practices yum has a supplier code of conduct for all us suppliers to our business to ensure the quality and safety of food products suppliers and distributors are required to meet strict quality control standards longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are used to ensure availability of products the company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available prices paid for these supplies fluctuate when prices increase the company may be able to pass on such increases to its customers although there is no assurance that this can be done practically 

most food products paper and packaging supplies and equipment used in the operation of the company’s restaurants are distributed to individual restaurant units by third party distribution companies mclane company inc “mclane” is the exclusive distributor for companyoperated kfcs pizza huts taco bells and long john silvers in the us and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores mclane became the distributor when it assumed all distribution responsibilities under an existing agreement between ameriserve food distribution inc “ameriserve” and the company this agreement extends through october 31 2010 and generally prohibits companyoperated kfc pizza hut and taco bell restaurants from using alternative distributors in the us the company stores within the ljs and aw systems are covered under a separate agreement with mclane 

international and china divisions outside of the us we and our franchisees use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global regional and local suppliers and distributors in certain countries we own all or a portion of the distribution system including mainland china where we own the entire distribution system 

trademarks and patents 

the company and its concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks the company believes that many of these marks including its kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® taco bell® and long john silver’s® marks have significant value and are materially important to its business the company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks the company also licenses certain aw trademarks and service marks the “aw marks” which are owned by aw concentrate company formerly aw brands inc aw concentrate company which is not affiliated with the company has granted the company an exclusive worldwide excluding canada perpetual royaltyfree license with the right to sublicense to use the aw marks for restaurant services 

the use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs and aw franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use the company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to its business

competition 

the retail food industry in which the company competes is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience location and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees in 2007 the restaurant business in the us consisted of about 935000 restaurants representing approximately 535 billion in annual sales the company’s concepts accounted for about 2 of those restaurants and about 3 of those sales there is currently no way to reasonably estimate the size of the competitive market outside the us 

research and development “rd” 

the company operates rd facilities in louisville kentucky dallas texas and irvine california and in several locations outside the us including shanghai china the company expensed 39 million 33 million and 33 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively for rd activities from time to time independent suppliers also conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the yum system 

environmental matters 

the company is not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2007 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated 

government regulation 

us division   the company and its us division are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting its business each of the company’s restaurants in the us must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include health sanitation safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which

the company continues to monitor its facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act “ada” in order to conform to its requirements under the ada the company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of disabled persons we believe that expenditures if required would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows 

international   and china divisions  the company’s restaurants outside the us are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting the company’s us restaurants including laws and regulations concerning labor health sanitation and safety the restaurants outside the us are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment international compliance with environmental requirements has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position

risk factors 

tableend 

our business and industry face a variety of risks including operational legal regulatory and product risks the following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business and our results of operations other factors may exist that we cannot anticipate or that we do not consider significant based on currently available information 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past see note 22 guarantees commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of litigation arising from an e coli outbreak allegedly linked to a number of taco bell restaurants in the northeast us during novemberdecember 2006 and could occur in the future if such instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues were to occur whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors negative publicity could result which could adversely affect sales and profitability if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants additionally the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients finally like other companies in the restaurant industry some of our products may contain genetically engineered food products and our us suppliers are currently not required to label their products as such increased regulation of and opposition to genetically engineered food products have on occasion and may in the future force us to use alternative sources at increased costs 

our china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located in china as a result our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there these risks include changes in economic conditions including inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the regulatory environment in addition our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china although management believes it has structured our china operations to comply with local laws there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property and contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

our other foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

 

a significant portion of our restaurants are operated in foreign countries and territories outside of the us and china and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks which can vary substantially by market include political instability social and ethnic unrest changes in economic conditions including inflation consumer spending and unemployment levels the regulatory environment tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  

  

changes in commodity and other operating costs or supply chain and business disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we take measures to anticipate and react to changes in food energy and supply costs any increase in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results because we provide moderately priced food our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers may be limited additionally significant increases in gasoline prices could result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors each of which could adversely affect our business we rely on third party distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our stores interruption of distribution services due to financial distress or other issues could impact our operations our operating expenses also include employee benefits and insurance costs including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time finally our industry is susceptible to natural disasters which could result in restaurant closures and supply chain and business disruptions 

health concerns arising from outbreaks of avian flu may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels while fullycooked chicken has been determined to be safe for consumption and while we have taken and continue to take measures to anticipate and minimize the effect of these outbreaks on our business future outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to shift their preferences in addition outbreaks on a widespread basis could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

 

as a result of our franchising programs our operating results are dependent upon the sales volumes and viability of our franchisees any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results we have limited control over our franchisees and the quality of franchise restaurant operations may be impacted by factors that are not in our control franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us or be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them in addition franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules our franchisees generally depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants in some instances financing has been difficult to obtain for some operators any of these problems could slow our planned growth 

our results and financial condition could be affected by the success of our refranchising program 

 

we are in the process of a refranchising program which could reduce the percentage of company ownership in the us excluding licensees from approximately 22 at the end of 2007 to potentially less than 10 by the end of 2010 our ability to execute this plan will depend on among other things whether we can find viable and appropriate buyers for our restaurants how quickly we can agree to terms with potential buyers and the availability of financing to potential buyers the success of the refranchising program once executed will depend on among other things our selection of buyers who can effectively operate our restaurants our ability to limit our exposure to contingent liabilities in connection with the sale of our restaurants and whether the resulting ownership mix of companyoperated and franchiseeoperated restaurants allows us to meet our financial objectives in addition refranchising activity could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and that volatility could impact our reported earnings 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

 

like others in the restaurant industry we are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants regardless of whether any claims against us are 

  

  

valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a judgment for significant monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

 

we and our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies requirements of local authorities with respect to zoning land use licensing permitting and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly complex federal and state immigration laws and regulations 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial 

we also face risks from new or changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling regulation compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in addition we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we may not attain our target development goals 

 

we are pursuing a disciplined growth strategy which to be successful will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to upgrade existing restaurants and open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new upgraded or converted restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any restaurant we open or convert will obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants the success of our planned expansion will depend upon numerous factors many of which are beyond our control 

our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in our international markets risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our or our franchisees’ ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations obtain required permits and approvals and hire and train qualified personnel 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development price advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if consumer preferences change or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets our business could be adversely 

  

  

affected in the retail food industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees in addition our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions disposable consumer income and consumer confidence adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing either of which could harm our results of operations

strategies 

the company continues to focus on four key strategies 

build leading brands in china in every significant category – the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants respectively in mainland china additionally the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage given this strong competitive position a rapidly growing economy and a population of 13 billion in mainland china the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of pizza hut home service pizza delivery and east dawning chinese food our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual systemsales growth of 20 in mainland china driven by at least 425 new restaurants each year which we expect to drive annual operating profit growth of 20 in the china division 

drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere – the company and its franchisees opened over 850 new restaurants in 2007 in the company’s international division representing 8 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants the international division generated 480 million in operating profit in 2007 up from 186 million in 1998 the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india france russia vietnam and africa our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual operating profit growth of 10 driven by 750 new restaurant openings annually for the international division new unit development is expected to contribute to system sales growth of at least 5 3 to 4 unit growth and 2 to 3 same store sales growth each year 

dramatically improve us brand positions consistency and returns – the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience the company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts we are the leader in multibranding with nearly 3700 restaurants providing customers two or more of our brands at a single location we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on company owned restaurants our ongoing earnings growth model calls for annual operating profit growth of 5 in the us with same store sales growth of 2 to 3 and leverage of our general and administrative “ga” infrastructure 

drive industryleading longterm shareholder and franchisee value – the company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends the company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the quick service restaurants “qsr” industry additionally 2007 was the third consecutive year in which the company returned over 11 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends the company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35 to 40 of net income 

2007 highlights 

 

 

significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results 

the following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended december 29 2007 december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 and could impact comparability with our results in 2008 

mainland china commodity inflation 

china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales declined to 201 during 2007 from 204 in 2006 this decline was driven by rising chicken costs in mainland china which make up approximately 40 of mainland china’s cost of food and paper and higher restaurant labor costs in mainland china rising chicken costs are resulting from both lower than expected availability and increased demand in the market the increased costs were partially offset in 2007 by strong same store sales growth including the impact of menu pricing increases in mainland china we expect that high commodity inflation including higher chicken costs will continue into the first half of 2008 and moderate later in the year 

us restaurant profit 

our resulting us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 13 percentage points in 2007 and increased 08 percentage points in 2006 our us restaurant profit was impacted in 2007 and 2006 by several key events and trends these include the negative impact on the taco bell business of adverse publicity related to a producesourcing issue in the fourth quarter of 2006 and an infestation issue in one franchise store in february 2007 fluctuations in commodity costs and lower selfinsured property and casualty insurance reserves 

taco bell experienced significant sales declines at both company and franchise stores in the fourth quarter 2006 and for almost all of 2007 particularly in the northeast us where both issues originated for the full year 2007 taco bells company same store sales were down 5 taco bell’s company same store sales were flat in the fourth quarter of 2007 and we believe that taco bell will fully recover from these issues however our experience has been that recoveries of this type vary in duration 

in 2007 we experienced significant increases in commodity costs resulting in approximately 44 million of commodity inflation this inflation was primarily driven by meats and cheese products we expect these unfavorable commodity trends to continue in 2008 resulting in commodity inflation of approximately 5 for the full year with the majority of this impact seen in the first half of the year in 2006 restaurant profits were positively impacted versus 2005 by a decline in commodity costs principally meats and cheese of approximately 45 million 

the sizeable february 2008 beef recall in the us had no impact on our results though the impact if any on beef prices going forward is not yet known 

selfinsurance property and casualty insurance expenses were down 27 million versus the prior year in both 2007 and 2006 exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchising stores the favorability in insurance expenses was the result of improved loss trends which we believe are primarily driven by safety and claims handling procedures we implemented over time as well as workers’ compensation reforms at the state level we anticipate that given the significant favorability in 2007 property and casualty expense in 2008 will be significantly higher in comparison the increased expenses are currently expected to be most impactful to our second quarter of 2008 

 

 

pizza hut united kingdom acquisition 

on september 12 2006 we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom “uk” unconsolidated affiliate from our partner paying approximately 178 million in cash including transaction costs and net of 9 million of cash assumed additionally we assumed the full liability as opposed to our fifty percent share associated with the pizza hut uk’s capital leases of 97 million and shortterm borrowings of 23 million this unconsolidated affiliate operated more than 500 restaurants in the uk 

prior to the acquisition we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting thus we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate since the date of the acquisition we have reported company sales and the associated restaurant costs ga expense interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer record franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate nor do we report other income under the equity method of accounting as a result of this acquisition company sales and restaurant profit increased 576 million and 59 million respectively franchise fees decreased 19 million and ga expenses increased 33 million in the year ended december 29 2007 compared to the year ended december 30 2006 as a result of this acquisition company sales and restaurant profit increased 164 million and 16 million respectively franchise fees decreased 7 million and ga expenses increased 8 million in the year ended december 30 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant in either year 

extra week in 2005 

our fiscal calendar results in a 53rd week every five or six years fiscal year 2005 included a 53rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period as opposed to a monthly basis in the us we permanently accelerated the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december 2005 and thus there was no 53rd week benefit for this business additionally all china division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53rd week 

the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease of the 53rd week on fiscal year 2005 revenues and operating profit 

 

 

  

  

  

 

mainland china 2005 business issues 

our kfc business in mainland china was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late march 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to avian flu in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the aforementioned issues the china division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11 excluding foreign currency translation which was below our ongoing target of at least 22 during the year ended december 30 2006 the china division recovered from these issues and achieved growth rates of 23 for both system sales and company sales both excluding foreign currency translation during 2005 we entered into agreements with the supplier of the aforementioned ingredient as a result we recognized recoveries of approximately 24 million in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2005 

significant 2008 gains and charges 

in 2008 we expect that our results of operations will be significantly impacted by several events including the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan and refranchising gains and charges related to our us business 

in december 2007 we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for 128 million in cash includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 2007 our international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close thus consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period the pretax gain on the sale of this investment of approximately 87 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2008 we also anticipate pretax gains from refranchising in the us of 20 million to 50 million in 2008 we expect that together these gains will be partially offset by charges relating to ga productivity initiatives and realignment of resources as well as investments in our us brands to drive stronger growth the net impact of all of the aforementioned gains and charges is expected to generate approximately 50 million in operating profit in 2008 

while we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both kfcs and pizza huts in japan it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate excluding the onetime gain we do not expect that the sale of our interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate will have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2008 and beyond as the other income we recorded representing our share of earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate has historically not been significant 4 million in 2007 

future tax legislation – mainland china 

on march 16 2007 the national people’s congress in mainland china enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on january 1 2008 upon enactment which occurred in the china division’s 2007 second fiscal quarter the deferred tax balances of all chinese entities including our unconsolidated affiliates were adjusted the impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended december 29 2007 were not significant we currently estimate that these income tax rate changes will positively impact our 2008 net income between 10 million and 15 million compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted 

mexico value added tax “vat” exemption 

on october 1 2007 mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to vat payments beginning on january 1 2008 we will be required to remit vat on all company restaurant sales resulting in lower company sales and restaurant profit as a result of this new legislation we estimate that our 2008 international division’s company sales and restaurant profit will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 38 million and 34 million respectively additionally the international division’s system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 03 and 12 percentage points respectively 

  

  

  

china 2008 reporting issues 

we have historically not consolidated an entity in china in which we have a majority ownership interest instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting our partners in this entity are essentially stateowned enterprises we have not consolidated this entity due to the historical effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business as addressed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9616 investors accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights concurrent with a decision that we made on january 1 2008 regarding top management of the entity we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business accordingly we will begin to consolidate this entity in 2008 the change will result in higher company sales restaurant profit ga expenses and income tax provision as well as lower franchise and license fees and other income had this change occurred at the beginning of 2007 our china division’s company sales restaurant profit and ga expenses would have increased approximately 227 million 49 million and 5 million respectively and our franchise and license fees and other income would have decreased 14 million and 13 million respectively the net impact of these changes and the resulting minority interest would have resulted in operating profit increasing by 11 million with an offsetting increase in income tax provision such that net income would not have been impacted 

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in the us we are targeting company ownership of restaurants potentially below 10 by year end 2010 down from its current level of 22 consistent with this strategy 756 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in 2006 and 2007 in the international division we expect to refranchise approximately 300 pizza huts in the uk over the next several years reducing our pizza hut company ownership in that market from approximately 80 currently to approximately 40 refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure additionally ga expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities the timing of such declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals ga expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct ga that we are no longer incurring as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year 

the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities 

 

in addition to our refranchising program from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit 

  

  

  

collectively “store closures” store closure income costs includes the net of gain or loss on sales of real estate on which we formerly operated a company restaurant that was closed lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves and other facilityrelated expenses from previously closed stores 

the following table summarizes worldwide company store closure activities 

 

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and company store closures is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and ga expenses and b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised the amounts presented below reflect the estimated historical results from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year the amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit

for 2007 and 2006 company multibrand unit gross additions were 86 and 212 respectively for 2007 and 2006 franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 283 and 197 respectively there are no multibrand units in the china division

company restaurant margins 

 

 

 

in 2007 the decrease in us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of higher commodity costs primarily cheese and meats and higher wage rates due primarily to state minimum wage rate increases the decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower selfinsured property and casualty insurance expense driven by improved loss trends as well as the favorable impact on restaurant margin of refranchising and closing certain restaurants

ga expenses increased 9 in 2007 including a 2 unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation excluding the additional ga expenses associated with acquiring the pizza hut uk business which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ga expense increased 4 the increase was driven by higher annual incentive and other compensation costs including amounts associated with strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets 

ga expenses increased 2 in 2006 the increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets partially offset by lapping higher prior year litigation related costs the net impact of the additional ga expenses associated with acquiring the pizza hut uk business the favorable impact of lapping the 53 rd week in 2005 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was not significant

operating profit 

 

neither unallocated and corporate expenses which comprise ga expenses nor unallocated refranchising gain loss are allocated to the us international division or china division segments for performance reporting purposes the increase in unallocated and corporate expenses in 2007 was driven by an increase in annual incentive compensation and project costs the decrease in 2006 unallocated and corporate expenses was driven by the lapping of the unfavorable impact of 2005 litigation related costs 

us operating profit decreased 3 in 2007 the decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs principally commodities and labor partially offset by lower ga expenses lower closure and impairment expenses and an increase in other income 

excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005 us operating profit increased 3 in 2006 the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales on restaurant profit due to higher average guest check and franchise and license fees new unit development and lower closures and impairment expenses these increases were 

  

  

  

partially offset by the unfavorable impact of refranchising higher ga expenses and a charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in 2006 the impact of lower commodity costs and lower property and casualty insurance expense on restaurant profit was largely offset by higher other restaurant costs including labor advertising and utilities  

international division operating profit increased 18 in 2007 including a 6 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees the increase was partially offset by higher ga expenses including expenses which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the pizza hut uk business and higher restaurant operating costs 

excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005 international division operating profit increased 11 in 2006 the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit these increases were partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and lower equity income from unconsolidated affiliates foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact 

china division operating profit increased 30 in 2007 including a 7 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit the increase was partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and ga expenses 

china division operating profit increased 37 in 2006 including a 4 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit as well as an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates these increases were partially offset by higher ga expenses and the lapping of a prior year financial recovery from a supplier 

interest expense net 

 

net interest expense increased 12 million or 8 in 2007 the increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2007 compared to 2006 partially offset by an increase in interest bearing cash equivalents in 2007 compared to 2006 net interest expense increased 27 million or 21 in 2006 the increase was driven by both an increase in interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt and increased borrowings as compared to prior year 

income taxes 

 

 

  

  

  

 

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 

 

our 2007 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals in december 2007 the company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations distributed a 275 million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate as a result in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed approximately 82 million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that we now believe are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns in 2007 benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by 36 million of expense associated with the 275 million intercompany dividend and approximately 20 million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of 2007 these negative impacts were partially offset by a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the us additionally the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the yearoveryear change in adjustments to reserves and prior years 

our 2006 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular us audit cycle as well as certain outofyear adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by 22 percentage points the reversal of tax reserves was partially offset by valuation allowance additions on foreign tax credits for which as a result of the tax reserve reversals we believed were not likely to be utilized before they expired we also recognized deferred tax assets for the foreign tax credit impact of nonrecurring decisions to repatriate certain foreign earnings in 2007 however we provided full valuation allowances on such assets as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized at that time 

our 2005 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals for certain deferred tax assets whose realization became more likely than not as well as the recognition of certain nonrecurring foreign tax credits we were able to substantiate in 2005 the impact of these items was partially offset by tax expense associated with our 2005 decision to repatriate approximately 390 million in qualified foreign earnings these earnings were eligible for a dividends received deduction in accordance with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves including interest thereon established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure 

  

  

  

 

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1567 million compared to 1299 million in 2006 the increase was primarily driven by higher net income lower pension contributions and lower income tax payments in 2007 

in 2006 net cash provided by operating activities was 1299   million compared to 1233   million in 2005 the increase was driven by a higher net income lower pension contributions and a 2006 partial receipt of the settlement related to the 2005 mainland china supplier ingredient issue these factors were offset by higher income tax and interest payments in 2006 

net cash used in investing activities was 432 million versus 476 million in 2006 the decrease was driven by the lapping of the acquisition of the remaining interest in our pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate in 2006 and proceeds from the sale of our interest in the japan unconsolidated affiliate in december 2007 partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and a 2007 increase in capital spending 

in december 2007 we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for 128 million includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 2007 the international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close thus consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period the pretax gain on the sale of this investment of approximately 87 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2008 however the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december 2007 and are thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 29 2007 the offset to this cash on our consolidated balance sheet at december 29 2007 is in accounts payable and other current liabilities 

in 2006 net cash used in investing activities was 476 million versus 345 million in 2005 the increase was driven by the 2006 acquisitions of the remaining interest in our pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate and the rostik’s brand and associated intellectual properties in russia the lapping of proceeds related to the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in our former polandczech republic unconsolidated affiliate also contributed to the increase these factors were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from refranchising in 2006 

net cash used in financing activities was 678 million versus 670 million in 2006 the increase was driven by higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments partially offset by an increase in net borrowings 

in 2006 net cash used in financing activities was 670 million versus 827 million in 2005 the decrease was driven by an increase in net borrowings and lower share repurchases partially offset by a reduction in the excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and higher dividend payments 

consolidated financial condition 

the increase in shortterm borrowings at december 29 2007 was primarily due to the classification of 250 million in senior unsecured notes as shortterm borrowings due to their may 2008 maturity date partially offset by the repayment of two termloans in the international division during the year ended december 29 2007 the increase in longterm debt was primarily due to the 2007 issuance of 600 million aggregate principal amount of 625 senior unsecured notes that are due march 15 2018 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior unsecured notes that are due november 15 2037 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in each of the last six fiscal years net cash 

  

  

  

provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future additionally we estimate that refranchising proceeds prior to income taxes will total at least 400 million in 2008 our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized however we believe our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity would allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2008 and beyond 

discretionary spending 

during 2007 we invested 742 million in our businesses including approximately 307 million in the us 189 million for the international division and 246 million for the china division for 2008 we estimate capital spending will be between 700 and 750 million 

we returned approximately 17 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends in 2007 this is the third straight year that we returned over 11 billion to our shareholders under the authority of our board of directors we repurchased 418 million shares of our common shares for 14 billion during 2007 at december 29 2007 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to 813 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under an october 2007 authorization by our board of directors that allowed us to repurchase 125 billion of the company’s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through october 2008 subsequent to the company’s year end our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases of up to an additional 125 billion of the company’s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through january 2009 

in october 2007 the company announced that we plan to substantially increase the amount of share buybacks over the next two years buying back a total of up to 4 billion of the company’s outstanding common stock helping to reduce our diluted share count by as much as 20 since the announcement of this plan the company has repurchased 437 million of our outstanding common stock through december 29 2007 we expect this twoyear share repurchase program will be funded by a combination of the company’s ongoing free cash flow additional debt and refranchising proceeds the completion of this plan will depend on the company’s cash flows credit rating proceeds from our refranchising efforts and availability of other investment opportunities among other factors 

during the year ended december 29 2007 we paid cash dividends of 273 million additionally on november 16 2007 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 015 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 1 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 11 2008 

for 2008 we expect to return over 2 billion to shareholders through both cash dividends and significant share repurchases we are now expecting a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 8 for 2008 and an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35  40 of net income 

borrowing capacity 

on november 29 2007 the company executed an amended and restated fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” totaling 115 billion which replaced a fiveyear facility in the amount of 10 billion that was set to expire on september 7 2009 the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens and certain other transactions specified in the agreement we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 29 2007 

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker’s acceptances where applicable at december 29 2007 our unused credit facility totaled 971 million 

  

  

  

net of outstanding letters of credit of 179 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 29 2007 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 025 to 125 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or is determined by an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

on november 29 2007 the company executed an amended and restated fiveyear revolving credit facility the “international credit facility” or “icf” totaling 350 million which replaced a fiveyear facility also in the amount of 350 million that was set to expire on november 8 2010 the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum and by yum’s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the credit facility we were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of 2007 

there were borrowings of 28 million and available credit of 322 million outstanding under the icf at the end of 2007 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 031 to 150 over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

in 2006 we executed two shortterm borrowing arrangements the “term loans” on behalf of the international division there were borrowings of 183 million outstanding at the end of 2006 under the term loans both of which expired and were repaid in the first quarter of 2007 

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2008 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 625 to 888 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 28 billion at december 29 2007 this amount includes 600 million aggregate principal amount of 625 senior unsecured notes due march 15 2018 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior unsecured notes due november 15 2037 both of which were issued in october 2007 we are using the proceeds from these notes to repay outstanding borrowings on our credit facility for additional share repurchases and for general corporate purposes 

contractual obligations 

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 29 2007 included 

 

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately 319 million for longterm liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations and given the status of the examinations we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow we have included in the contractual obligations table 9 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in cash in the next year 

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table our most significant plan the yum retirement plan the “us plan” is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain fulltime us salaried employees our funding policy with respect to the us plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements including requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the us plan’s funded status the us plan’s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of us plan assets based on current funding rules we do not anticipate being required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2008 but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the us plan’s expected december 27 2008 funded status during 2007 we did not make a discretionary contribution to the us plan at our september 30 2007 measurement date our pension plans in the us which include the us plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan had a projected benefit obligation of 842 million and plan assets of 732 million 

the funding rules for our pension plans outside of the us vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates performance of plan assets local laws and tax regulations our most significant plans are in the uk including a plan for which we assumed full liability upon our purchase of the remaining fifty percent interest in our former pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate since our plan assets approximate our projected benefit obligation for our kfc uk pension plan we did not make a significant contribution in 2007 and we do not anticipate any significant further near term funding the projected benefit obligation of our pizza hut uk pension plan exceeds plan assets by approximately 27 million at our november 30 2007 measurement date we anticipate taking steps to reduce this deficit in the near term which could include a decision to partially or completely fund the deficit in 2008 however given the level of cash flows from operations the company anticipates generating in 2008 any funding decision would not materially impact our ability to maintain our planned levels of discretionary spending 

our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 4 million in 2007 see note 16 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are selfinsured including workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” and employee healthcare and longterm disability claims 

  

  

  

the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee healthcare longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had provided a partial guarantee of approximately 12 million of a franchisee loan pool related primarily to the company’s historical refranchising programs and to a lesser extent franchisee development of new restaurants at december 29 2007 in support of this guarantee we have provided a standby letter of credit of 18 million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of the franchisee loan pool the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were approximately 62 million at december 29 2007 

the loan pool is funded by the issuance of commercial paper by a conduit established for that purpose a disruption in the commercial paper markets may result in the company and the participating financial institutions having to fund commercial paper issuances that have matured any company funding under its guarantee or letter of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising gain loss new loans added to the loan pool in 2007 were not significant 

our unconsolidated affiliates do not have significant amounts of debt outstanding as of december 29 2007 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further details of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group impairment evaluations for individual restaurants that we are currently operating and have not offered for sale are performed on a semiannual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant our semiannual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our semiannual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant which can be for a period of over 20 years and any terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 

if the longlived assets of a restaurant subject to our semiannual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows we write the assets down to their fair value this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted after tax cash flows including terminal value of the restaurant at an appropriate rate the discount rate used is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 

we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform such impairment evaluations at the group level these impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds expected sales proceeds 

  

  

  

are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated using either discounted expected future cash flows from operations or the present value of the estimated future franchise royalty stream plus any estimated sales proceeds from refranchising any estimated sales proceeds are based on relevant historical sales multiples the discount rate used in determining fair value is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 

we have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions these include trademarkbrand intangible assets for kfc ljs and aw we believe the value of a trademarkbrand is derived from the royalty we avoid in the case of company stores or receive in the case of franchise stores due to our ownership of the trademarkbrand we have determined that the kfc trademarkbrand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized our impairment test for the kfc trademarkbrand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount future sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the kfc trademarkbrand 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the kfc trademarkbrand we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth margin improvement and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans for 2007 there was no impairment of goodwill or the kfc trademarkbrand 

we have certain intangible assets such as the ljs and aw trademarkbrand intangible assets franchise contract rights reacquired franchise rights and favorableunfavorable operating leases which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate we base the expected useful lives of reacquired franchise rights over a period for which we believe it is reasonable that we will operate a company restaurant in the trade area we base the expected useful lives of our favorableunfavorable operating leases on the remaining lease term 

our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets 

allowances for franchise and license receivableslease guarantees 

we reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon predefined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due as a result of reserving using this methodology we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december 29 2007 

  

  

  

 

we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants such guarantees are subject to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” “sfas 145” we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 

if payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees at december 29 2007 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable the potential total exposure under such leases is significant with approximately 325 million representing the present value discounted at our pretax cost of debt of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 29 2007 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and historically we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

see note 22 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

see note 22 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

pension plans 

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us in accordance with sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” “sfas 158” we have recorded the underfunded status of 110 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2007 these us plans had projected benefit obligations “pbo” of 842 million and fair values of plan assets of 732 million in december 29 2007 

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo’s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbo using a discount rate of 650 at september 30 2007 this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody’s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as 

  

  

  

necessary   a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 65 million at our measurement date conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 71 million at our measurement dates 

the pension expense we will record in 2008 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately 19 million to 37 million in 2008 the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss of 17 million in 2008 a 50 basis point change in our weighted average discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2008 us pension expense by approximately 10 million 

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets at september 30 2007 was 80 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our 2008 us pension plan expense by approximately 7 million 

the losses our us plan assets have experienced along with a decrease in discount rates over time have largely contributed to an unrecognized net loss of 80 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december 29 2007 for purposes of determining 2007 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 23 million of this loss in net periodic benefit cost we will recognize approximately 6 million of such loss in 2008 

see note 16 for further discussion of our pension and postretirement plans 

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our specific weightedaverage assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 17 additionally under sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased compensation” “sfas 123r” we are required to estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

we have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans historically approximately 15  20 of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 

grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by sfas 123r we revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis based on the results of this analysis we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives 

upon each stock award grant we revaluate the expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 45 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 20 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

  

  

  

 

income tax valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 29 2007 we had a valuation allowance of 308 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of 363 million as well as our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities effective december 31 2006 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement at december 29 2007 we had 376 million of unrecognized tax benefits 194 million of which if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 3 million and 9 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 would decrease approximately 31 million and 32 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 would decrease approximately 173 million and 69 million respectively fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 

  

  

  

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately 54 of our operating profit in 2007 excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 15 billion as of december 29 2007 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific the americas and europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 operating profit would have decreased 89 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors 

cautionary statements

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

  

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under standard franchise agreements franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building and equipment and purchasing signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

  

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including new products equipment and management techniques 

  

the company and its franchisees also operate multibrand units primarily in the us where two or more of the concepts are operated in a single unit at yearend 2006 there were 3636 multibranded units in the worldwide system of which 3433 were in the us these units were comprised of 2619 units offering food products from two of the concepts a “2n1” 48 units offering food products from three of the concepts a “3n1” and 946 units offering food products from pizza hut and wingstreet a flavored chicken wings concept yum has developed 23 units offering food products from kfc and wing works another flavored chicken wings concept developed by yum

restaurant operations 

  

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

  

the company’s restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in the us the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis we issue detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation 

  

procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our proprietary core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants the company’s restaurants are visited from time to time by various senior operators who help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

  

rgms attend and complete their respective concepts’ required training programs these programs consist of initial training as well as additional continuing development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to time initial manager training programs generally last at least six weeks and emphasize leadership business management supervisory skills including training coaching and recruiting product preparation and production safety quality control customer service labor management and equipment maintenance

competition 

  

the retail food industry in which the company competes is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience location and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned 

  

restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees in 2006 the restaurant business in the us consisted of about 925000 restaurants representing approximately 511 billion in annual sales the company’s concepts accounted for about 2 of those restaurants and about 3 of those sales there is currently no way to reasonably estimate the size of the competitive market outside the us

the company is also subject to federal and state child labor laws which among other things prohibit the use of certain “hazardous equipment” by employees younger than 18 years of age the company has not to date been materially adversely affected by such laws 

  

the company continues to monitor its facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act “ada” in order to conform to its requirements under the ada the company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of disabled persons we believe that expenditures if required would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows

risk factors  

tableend 

  

we face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry including operational legal regulatory and product risks the following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business and our results of operations other factors may exist that the company cannot anticipate or that the company does not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available 

  

health concerns arising from outbreaks of avian flu may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels while fullycooked chicken has been determined to be safe for consumption and while the company has taken and continues to take measures to anticipate and minimize the effect of these outbreaks on our business any further outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to shift their preferences in addition outbreaks on a widespread basis could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

  

  

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

the company considers food safety a top priority and dedicates substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past see item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k for a discussion of litigation arising from an e coli outbreak allegedly linked to a number of taco bell restaurants in the northeast us during novemberdecember 2006 and could occur in the future if such instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues were to occur whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors negative publicity could result which could adversely affect sales and profitability if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants additionally the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients finally like other companies in the restaurant industry some of our products may contain genetically engineered food products increased regulation of and opposition to genetically engineered food products have on occasion and may in the future force us to use alternative sources at increased costs 

  

our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

  

our restaurants are operated in numerous countries and territories and our foreign business is significant we intend to further expand our international operations over the next several years as a result our business and operations are subject to the risk of changes in economic conditions tax systems consumer preferences social conditions and political conditions inherent in foreign operations including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  

mainland china is one of our fastest developing markets any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business our growing investments in our china operations will increase our exposure in this market many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china although management believes it has structured our china operations to comply with local laws there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property and contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

  

changes in commodity and other operating costs or supply chain and business disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

while the company takes measures to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese and produce among others could adversely affect our operating results although we try to manage the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results we remain susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns product recalls labor disputes and government regulations in addition to food we purchase electricity oil and natural gas needed to operate our restaurants and suppliers purchase gasoline needed to transport food and supplies to us any significant increase in energy costs could adversely affect our business through higher rates and the imposition of fuel surcharges by our suppliers because we provide moderately priced food we may choose not to or be unable to pass along commodity price increases to our customers additionally significant increases in gasoline prices could result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants we rely on third party distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our stores interruption of distribution services due to financial distress or other issues could impact our operations our operating costs also include premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which 

  

may increase over time thereby further increasing our costs finally our industry is susceptible to natural disasters which could result in restaurant closures and business disruptions 

  

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

as a result of our franchising programs our operating results are dependent upon the sales volumes and viability of our franchisees any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us or be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them in addition franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules our franchisees generally depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants in some instances financing has been difficult to obtain for some operators any of these problems could slow our planned growth 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

  

as a restaurant industry participant we are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a judgment for significant monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

  

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some guests we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

  

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

  

we and our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies requirements of local authorities with respect to zoning land use licensing permitting and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

  

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial 

  

we may not attain our target development goals 

  

we are pursuing a disciplined growth strategy which to be successful will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to upgrade existing restaurants and open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new upgraded or converted restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any restaurant we open or convert will obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants the success of our planned expansion including our multibranding initiatives will depend upon numerous factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

the restaurant industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

  

the restaurant industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if our restaurants and franchised restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other restaurants in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected in the restaurant industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees in addition our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions disposable consumer income and consumer confidence adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing either of which could harm our results of operations

employees 

  

at any given time the company or its affiliates employ hundreds of thousands of persons primarily in its restaurants in addition each year thousands of persons seek employment with the company and its restaurants from time to time disputes arise regarding employee hiring compensation termination and promotion practices 

  

like other retail employers the company has been faced in a few states with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations 

  

on august 13 2003 a class action lawsuit against pizza hut inc styled coldiron v pizza hut inc  was filed in the united states district court central district of california plaintiff alleged that she and other current and former pizza hut restaurant general managers “rgms” were improperly classified as exempt employees under the us fair labor standards act “flsa” there was also a pendent state law claim alleging that current and former rgms in california were misclassified under that state’s law plaintiff sought unpaid overtime wages and penalties on may 5 2004 the district court granted conditional certification of a nationwide class of rgms under the flsa claim providing notice to prospective class members and an opportunity to join the class approximately 12 percent of the eligible class members elected to join the litigation however on june 30 2005 the district court granted pizza hut’s motion to strike all flsa class members who joined the litigation after july 15 2004 the effect of this order was to reduce the number of flsa class members to only approximately 88 or approximately 25 of the eligible class members 

  

in november 2005 the parties agreed to a settlement which we provided for in our 2005 consolidated financial statements the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on june 28 2006 final approval of the settlement was granted on october 5 2006 and payment was made during the quarter ended december 30 2006 

  

on november 26 2001 a lawsuit against long john silver’s inc “ljs” styled kevin johnson on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v long john silver’s inc “johnson” was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee nashville division johnson’s suit alleged that ljs’s former “securityrestitution for losses” policy the “policy” provided for deductions from rgms’ and assistant restaurant general managers’ “argms” salaries that violate the salary basis test for exempt personnel under regulations issued pursuant to the flsa johnson alleged that all rgms and argms who were employed by ljs for the three year period prior to the lawsuit – ie since november 26 1998 – should be treated as the equivalent of hourly employees and thus were eligible under the flsa for overtime for any hours worked over 40 during all weeks in the recovery period in addition johnson claimed that the potential members of the class are entitled to certain liquidated damages and attorneys’ fees under the flsa 

  

ljs believed that johnson’s claims as well as the claims of all other similarly situated parties should be resolved in individual arbitrations pursuant to ljs’s dispute resolution program “drp” and that a collective action to resolve these claims in court was clearly inappropriate under the current state of the law accordingly ljs moved to compel arbitration in the johnson case ljs and johnson also agreed to stay the action effective december 17 2001 pending mediation and entered into a tolling agreement for that purpose after mediation did not resolve the case and after limited discovery and a hearing the court determined on june 7 2004 that johnson’s individual claims should be referred to arbitration johnson appealed and the decision of the district court was affirmed in all respects by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on july 5 2005 

  

on december 19 2003 counsel for plaintiff in the above referenced johnson lawsuit filed a separate demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association “aaa” on behalf of former ljs managers erin cole and nick kaufman the “cole arbitration” claimants in the cole arbitration demand a class arbitration on behalf of the same putative class  and the same underlying flsa claims  as were alleged in the johnson lawsuit the complaint in the cole arbitration subsequently was amended to allege a practice of deductions distinct from the allegations as to the policy in violation of the flsa salary basis test and to add victoria mcwhorter another ljs former manager as an additional claimant ljs has denied the claims and the putative class alleged in the cole arbitration and it is ljs’s position that the claims of cole kaufman and mcwhorter should be individually arbitrated 

  

arbitrations under ljs’s drp including the cole arbitration are governed by the rules of the aaa in october 2003 the aaa adopted its supplementary rules for class arbitrations “aaa class rules” the aaa appointed an arbitrator for the cole arbitration on june 15 2004 the arbitrator issued a clause construction award ruling that the drp does not preclude class arbitration ljs moved to vacate the clause construction award in the united states district court for the district of south carolina on september 15 2005 the federal court in south carolina ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear ljs’s motion to vacate ljs appealed the us district court’s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 

  

on january 5 2007 ljs moved to dismiss the clause construction award appeal and that motion was granted by the fourth circuit on january 10 2007 ljs had also filed a motion to vacate the clause construction award in south carolina state court which was stayed pending a decision by the fourth circuit ljs has agreed to dismiss the motion to vacate the clause construction award and has also agreed not to oppose claimants’ crossmotion to confirm that award by the south carolina court while judicial review of the clause construction award was pending in the us district court the arbitrator permitted claimants to move for a class determination award which was opposed by ljs on september 19 2005 the arbitrator issued a class determination award certifying a class of ljs’s rgms and argms employed between december 17 1998 and august 22 2004 on flsa claims to proceed on an optout basis under the aaa class rules that class determination award was upheld on appeal by the united states district court for the district of south carolina on january 20 2006 and the arbitrator declined to reconsider the award ljs has appealed the ruling of the us district court to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit ljs has also filed a motion to vacate the class determination award in south carolina state court which has been stayed by the south carolina court pending a decision by the fourth circuit in the class determination award appeal oral argument in the fourth circuit was heard on january 31 2007 

  

ljs believes that if the cole arbitration must proceed on a class basis i the proceedings should be governed by the optin collective action structure of the flsa and ii a class should not be certified under the applicable provisions of the flsa ljs also believes that each individual should not be able to recover for more than two years and a maximum three years prior to the date they file a consent to join the arbitration we have provided for the estimated costs of the cole arbitration based on a projection of eligible claims the amount of each eligible claim the estimated legal fees incurred by the claimants and the results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters but in view of the novelties of proceeding under the aaa class rules and the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurance that the outcome of the arbitration will not result in losses in excess of those currently provided for in our consolidated financial statements 

  

on september 2 2005 a collective action lawsuit against the company and kfc corporation originally styled parler v yum brands inc dba kfc and kfc corporation  was filed in the united states district court for the district of minnesota plaintiff alleges that he and other current and former kfc assistant unit managers “aums” were improperly classified as exempt employees under the flsa plaintiff seeks overtime wages and liquidated damages on january 17 2006 the district court dismissed the claims against the company with prejudice leaving kfc corporation as the sole defendant notice was mailed to current and former aums advising them of the litigation and providing an opportunity to join the case if they choose to do so plaintiff amended the complaint on september 8 2006 to add related state law claims on behalf of a putative class of kfc aums employed in illinois minnesota nevada new jersey new york ohio and pennsylvania on october 24 2006 plaintiff moved to decertify the conditionally certified flsa action and kfc corporation did not oppose the motion in january 2007 the magistrate recommended that the motion for decertification be granted 

  

we believe that kfc has properly classified its aums as exempt under the flsa and applicable state law and accordingly intend to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit however in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of this case cannot be predicted at this time likewise the amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

on august 4 2006 a putative class action lawsuit against taco bell corp styled rajeev chhibber vs taco bell corp was filed in orange county superior court on august 7 2006 another putative class action lawsuit styled marina puchalski v taco bell corp was filed in san diego county superior court both lawsuits were filed by a taco bell rgm purporting to represent all current and former rgms who worked at corporateowned restaurants in california from august 2002 to the present the lawsuits allege violations of california’s wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime and meal and rest period violations and seek unspecified amounts in damages and penalties as of september 7 2006 the orange county case was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff and both cases have been consolidated in san diego county 

  

taco bell denies liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit however in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of this case cannot be predicted at this time likewise the amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

customers 

  

the company’s restaurants serve a large and diverse crosssection of the public and in the course of serving so many people disputes arise regarding products service accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such as those of the company 

  

on december 17 2002 taco bell was named as the defendant in a class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california styled moeller et al v taco bell corp on august 4 2003 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that alleges among other things that taco bell has discriminated against the class of people who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility by failing to make its approximately 220 companyowned restaurants in california the “california restaurants” accessible to the class plaintiffs contend that queue rails and other architectural and structural elements of the taco bell restaurants relating to the path of travel and use of the facilities by persons with mobilityrelated disabilities including parking spaces ramps counters restroom facilities and seating do not comply with the us americans with disabilities act the “ada” the unruh civil rights act the “unruh act” and the california disabled persons act the “cdpa” plaintiffs have requested a an injunction from the district court ordering taco bell to comply with the ada and its implementing regulations b that the district court declare taco bell in violation of the ada the unruh act and the cdpa and c monetary relief under the unruh act or cdpa plaintiffs on behalf of the class are seeking the minimum statutory damages per offense of either 4000 under the unruh act or 2000 under the cdpa for each aggrieved member of the class plaintiffs contend that there may be in excess of 100000 individuals in the class for themselves the four named plaintiffs have claimed aggregate minimum statutory 

  

damages of no less than 16000 but are expected to claim greater amounts based on the number of taco bell outlets they visited at which they claim to have suffered discrimination 

  

on february 23 2004 the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification the district court certified a rule 23b2 mandatory injunctive relief class of all individuals with disabilities who use wheelchairs or electric scooters for mobility who at any time on or after december 17 2001 were denied or are currently being denied on the basis of disability the full and equal enjoyment of the california restaurants the class includes claims for injunctive relief and minimum statutory damages 

  

pursuant to the parties’ agreement on or about august 31 2004 the district court ordered that the trial of this action be bifurcated so that stage one will resolve plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief and stage two will resolve plaintiffs’ claims for damages the parties are currently proceeding with the equitable relief stage of this action during this stage taco bell filed a motion to partially decertify the class to exclude from the rule 23b2 class claims for monetary damages the district court denied the motion plaintiffs filed their own motion for partial summary judgment as to liability relating to a subset of the california restaurants the district court denied that motion as well discovery is ongoing as of the date of this report 

  

taco bell has denied liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit although this lawsuit is at a relatively early stage in the proceedings it is likely that certain of the california restaurants will be determined to be not fully compliant with accessibility laws and taco bell has begun to take certain steps to make those restaurants compliant however at this time it is not possible to estimate with reasonable certainty the potential costs to bring noncompliant california restaurants into compliance with applicable state and federal disability access laws nor is it possible at this time to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of liability for monetary damages on a class wide basis to taco bell 

  

intellectual property 

  

the company has registered trademarks and service marks many of which are of material importance to the company’s business from time to time the company may become involved in litigation to defend and protect its use of its registered marks 

  

other litigation 

  

according to the centers for disease control “cdc” there was an outbreak of illness associated with a particular strain of e coli 0157h7 in the northeast united states during november and december 2006 also according to the cdc the outbreak from this particular strain was associated with eating at taco bell restaurants in pennsylvania new jersey new york and delaware the cdc concluded that the outbreak ended on or about december 6 2006 the cdc has confirmed 71 cases of persons who became ill from this particular strain of e coli 0157h7 in the abovementioned area during the above time frame and that no deaths have been reported 

  

on december 6 2006 a lawsuit styled tyler vormittag et al v taco bell corp taco bell of america inc and yum brands inc was filed in the supreme court of the state of new york county of suffolk mr vormittag a minor alleges he became ill after consuming food which was allegedly contaminated with e coli 0157h7 purchased from a taco bell restaurant in riverhead new york subsequently ten other cases have been filed naming the company taco bell corp andor taco bell of america and alleging similar facts on behalf of other customers 

  

according to the allegations common to all the complaints each taco bell customer became ill after ingesting contaminated food in late november or early december 2006 from taco bell restaurants located in the northeast states implicated in the outbreak as these lawsuits are new no discovery by any party has been undertaken however the company believes based on the allegations that the stores identified in at least five of the complaints are in fact not owned by the company or any of its subsidiaries as such the company believes that at a minimum it is not liable for 

  

any losses at these stores we have provided for the estimated costs of this litigation based on a projection of potential claims and their amounts as well as the results of settlement negotiations in similar matters but in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurance that the outcome of the litigation will not result in losses in excess of those currently provided for in our consolidated financial statements

drive profitable international division expansion – the company and its franchisees opened over 700 new restaurants in 2006 in the company’s international division representing seven straight years of opening over 700 restaurants the international division generated over 400 million in operating profit in 2006 up from 186 million in 1998 the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india france and russia 

  

improve us brands positions and returns – the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience the company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts we are the leader in multibranding with over 3000 restaurants providing customers two or more of our brands at a single location we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on company owned restaurants 

  

drive high return on invested capital  strong shareholder payout – the company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends the company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the quick service restaurants “qsr” industry additionally 2006 was the second consecutive year in which the company returned over 11 billion to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends the company recently announced that it was doubling its quarterly dividend rate for the second quarter 2007 dividend payment and now expects to generate an approximate 2 dividend yield 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

throughout the management’s discussion and analysis “mda” the company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of currency translation these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates we also provide the percentage change excluding the extra week certain of our businesses had in fiscal 2005 we believe the elimination of the currency translation impact and the 53rd week impact provides better yeartoyear comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations or an extra week in fiscal 2005 

  

this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages 56 through 59 and the cautionary statements on page 52 all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 60 through 101 tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified 

  

significant known events trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results 

  

the following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended december 30 2006 december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 and could impact comparability with our results in 2007 

  

extra week in 2005 

  

our fiscal calendar results in a 53rd week every five or six years fiscal year 2005 included a 53rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period as opposed to a monthly basis in the us we permanently accelerated the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december 2005 and thus there was no 53rd week benefit for this business additionally all china division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53rd week 

  

the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease of the 53rd week on fiscal year 2005 revenues and operating profit 

  

 

  

mainland china recovery 

  

our kfc business in mainland china was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late march 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to avian flu in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the aforementioned issues the china division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11 excluding currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 22 during the year ended december 30 2006 the china division recovered from these issues and achieved growth rates of 23 for both system sales and company sales both excluding currency translation during 2005 we entered into agreements with the supplier of the aforementioned ingredient as a result we recognized recoveries of approximately 24 million in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

united states restaurant profit   

  

restaurant profits in the us were positively impacted by a decline of approximately 45 million in commodity costs principally meats and cheese for the year ended 2006 versus the year ended 2005 we expect commodity inflation in the us of 2 to 3 in 2007 

  

our us restaurant profits were also positively impacted by lower selfinsured property and casualty insurance expenses of 31 million for the year ended 2006 versus 2005 these lower insurance expenses were the result of improved loss trends which we believe are driven by safety and other measures we have implemented over time on our insurance reserves and lower property related losses including the lapping of the unfavorable impact of hurricane katrina in 2005 and a small related insurance recovery in 2006 while we anticipate that these favorable loss trends will continue it is difficult to forecast their impact including the impact of large property and casualty losses that may occur however we anticipate that given the significant favorability in 2006 property and casualty insurance expense in 2007 will be flat to slightly higher in comparison 

  

taco bell northeast united states producesourcing issue 

  

our taco bell business was negatively impacted by adverse publicity related to a producesourcing issue during november and december 2006 as a result taco bell experienced significant sales declines at both company and franchise stores particularly in the northeast united states where an outbreak of illness associated with a particular strain of e coli 0157h7 took place according to the centers for disease control this outbreak was associated with eating at taco bell restaurants in pennsylvania new jersey new york and delaware in the fourth quarter of 2006 taco bell’s company same store sales were down 5 driven largely by a very significant negative sales impact during the month of december overall we estimate this issue negatively impacted operating profit by 20 million in the fourth quarter of 

  

2006 due primarily to lost company sales and franchise and license fees as well as incremental marketing costs same store sales at taco bell have begun to recover from their lowest point in the third week of december while we anticipate that taco bell will fully recover from this issue by the middle of 2007 our experience has been that recoveries of this type vary in duration and could take longer the timing of such recovery will determine the impact on 2007 operating profit we currently forecast same store sales growth at taco bell in 2007 of one to two percent 

  

us beverage agreement contract termination 

  

during the first quarter of 2006 we entered into an agreement with a beverage supplier to certain of our concepts to terminate a longterm supply contract as a result of the cash payment we made to the supplier in connection with this termination we recorded a pretax charge of 8 million to other income expense in the quarter ended march 25 2006 the affected concepts have entered into an agreement with an alternative beverage supplier the contract termination charge we recorded in the quarter ended march 25 2006 was partly offset by more favorable beverage pricing for our concepts in 2006 we expect to continue to benefit from the more favorable pricing in 2007 and beyond 

  

pizza hut united kingdom acquisition 

  

on september 12 2006 we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom “uk” unconsolidated affiliate from our partner paying approximately 178 million in cash including transaction costs and net of 9 million of cash assumed additionally we assumed the full liability as opposed to our fifty percent share associated with the pizza hut uk’s capital leases of 95 million and shortterm borrowings of 23 million this unconsolidated affiliate operated more than 500 restaurants in the uk 

  

prior to the acquisition we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting thus we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income we also recorded franchise fee income from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate from the date of the acquisition through december 4 2006 the end of the fiscal year for pizza hut uk we reported company sales and the associated restaurant costs general and administrative expense interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income we no longer recorded franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate nor did we report other income under the equity method of accounting as a result of this acquisition company sales and restaurant profit increased 164 million and 16 million respectively franchise fees decreased 7 million and general and administrative expenses increased 8 million compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant 

  

adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” 

  

in the fourth quarter 2005 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” sfas 123r requires all new modified and unvested sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straightline basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest we adopted sfas 123r using the modified retrospective application transition method effective september 4 2005 the beginning of our 2005 fourth quarter as permitted by sfas 123r we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption our fiscal year 2005 as such the results for the first three quarters of 2005 were required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of sfas 123 however years prior to 2005 have not been restated 

  

as shown below the adoption of sfas 123r resulted in a decrease in net income of 38 million and a reduction of basic and diluted earnings per share of 013 for 2005 additionally cash flows from operating activities decreased 87 million in 2005 and cash flows from financing activities increased 87 million in 2005 the impact of applying sfas 123r on the results of operations and cash flows for 2006 was similar to the impact on 2005 

  

  

 

  

prior to 2005 all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related interpretations accordingly no stockbased employee compensation expense was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for stock options as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant had the company applied the fair value provisions of sfas 123 to stock options in 2004 net income of 740 million would have been reduced by 37 million to 703 million additionally both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased 012 per share for 2004 

  

sale of an investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

  

during the second quarter of 2005 we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all kfcs and pizza huts in poland and the czech republic to our then partner in the entity principally for cash concurrent with the sale our former partner completed an initial public offering “ipo” of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity prior to the sale we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method subsequent to the ipo the new publicly held entity in which yum has no ownership interest is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest 

  

in 2005 this transaction generated a gain of approximately 11 million for yum as cash proceeds net of expenses of approximately 25 million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate as with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates the gain of approximately 11 million was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income 

  

the sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2005 or 2006 

  

sale of puerto rico business   

  

our puerto rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of 2002 and was sold on october 4 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value as a result of this sale company sales and restaurant profit decreased 159 million and 29 million respectively franchise fees increased 10 million and general and administrative expenses decreased 9 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 25 2004 

  

lease accounting adjustments 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease including options in some instances over which we were recording rent expense including escalations on a straightline basis 

  

the cumulative adjustment primarily through increased us depreciation expense totaled 115 million 7 million after tax the portion of this adjustment that related to 2004 was approximately 3 million as the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to 

  

any of those prior period financial statements the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 consolidated financial statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements 

  

wrench litigation 

  

we recorded income of 2 million and 14 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively there was no impact from wrench litigation in 2006 see note 4 for a discussion of the wrench litigation 

  

ameriserve and other charges credits 

  

we recorded income of 1 million 2 million and 16 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively see note 4 for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits 

  

store portfolio strategy 

  

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees’ expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in the us we are in the process of decreasing our company ownership of restaurants from its current level of 23 to approximately 17 this threeyear plan calls for selling approximately 1500 company restaurants to franchisees from 2006 through 2008 in 2006 452 company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the international division we expect to refranchise approximately 300 pizza huts in the united kingdom over the next several years reducing our pizza hut company ownership in that market from approximately 80 currently to approximately 40 refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 

  

the following table summarizes our refranchising activities 

  

 

  

in addition to our refranchising program from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively “store closures” store closure costs income includes the net of gains or losses on sales of real estate on which we are not currently operating a company restaurant lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves and other facilityrelated expenses from previously closed stores 

  

the following table summarizes company store closure activities 

  

 

  

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and company store closures is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and general and administrative expenses and b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year the amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit

restaurant unit activity 

  

 

  

the above total excludes 2137 and 2376 licensed units at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively the worldwide total excludes 46 units from the acquisition of the rostik’s brand see note 10 that have not yet been cobranded into rostikskfc restaurants these units will be presented as franchisee new builds as the cobranding into rostik’skfc restaurants occurs balances at the end of 2004 for the worldwide and china unit activity have been adjusted to include december 2004 activity in mainland china due to the change in its reporting calendar the net change was an addition of 16 2 1 and 19 units for company unconsolidated affiliates franchisees and total respectively 

  

  

  

  

 

  

the above total excludes 1944 and 2181 licensed units at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

 

  

the above totals exclude 193 and 195 licensed units at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively the international division total excludes 46 units from the acquisition of the rostik’s brand see note 10 that have not yet been cobranded into rostikskfc restaurants these units will be presented as franchisee new builds as the cobranding into rostik’skfc restaurants occurs 

  

 

  

there are no licensed units in the china division 

  

included in the above totals are multibrand restaurants multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count similarly a new multibrand restaurant while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands results in just one additional unit count franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units multibrand restaurant totals were as follows 

  

 

  

 

  

for 2006 and 2005 company multibrand unit gross additions were 212 and 373 respectively for 2006 and 2005 franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 197 and 171 respectively there are no multibrand units in the china division 

  

system sales growth 

  

 

  

system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including companyowned franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales of franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company typically at a rate of 4 to 6 of sales franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income however the franchise and license fees are included in the company’s revenues we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development 

  

the explanations that follow for system sales growth consider year over year changes excluding the impact of currency translation and the 53rd week

revenues 

  

 

  

the explanations that follow for revenue fluctuations consider year over year changes excluding the impact of currency translation and the 53rd week 

  

excluding the favorable impact of the pizza hut uk acquisition worldwide company sales were flat in 2006 increases from new unit development and same store sales growth were offset by decreases in refranchising and store closures in 2005 the increase in worldwide company sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth partially offset by refranchising and store closures

company restaurant margins 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

in 2006 the increase in us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of lower commodity costs primarily meats and cheese the impact of same store sales on restaurant margin due to higher average guest check and the favorable impact of lower property and casualty insurance expense these increases were partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs higher labor costs primarily driven by wage rates and benefits and the lapping of the favorable impact of the 53rd week in 2005 the higher occupancy and other costs were driven by increased advertising and higher utility costs 

  

in 2005 us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was flat compared to 2004 the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by higher occupancy and other costs higher occupancy and other costs were 

  

driven by increases in utility costs and advertising costs a favorable impact from the 53rd week 13 basis points was offset by the unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r 17 basis points 

  

in 2006 the increase in international division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin as well as the favorable impact of refranchising and closing certain restaurants these increases were offset by higher labor costs and higher food and paper costs 

  

in 2005 the decrease in the international division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales included a 51 basis point unfavorable impact of refranchising our restaurants in puerto rico also contributing to the decrease were higher occupancy and other costs and higher labor costs the decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin the unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r 10 basis points was largely offset by the favorable impact of the 53rd week 8 basis points 

  

in 2006 the increase in china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin the increase was partially offset by the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operations 

  

in 2005 china division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales decreased the decrease was driven by the impact on restaurant margin of same store sales declines and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs the decrease was partially offset by lower food and paper costs principally due to supply chain savings initiatives 

  

worldwide general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative ga expenses increased 29 million or 2 in 2006 including a 1 favorable impact from lapping the 53rd week in 2005 the increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets as well as ga expenses for our pizza hut uk business which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent interest of the business in 2006 these increases were partially offset by lapping higher prior year litigation related costs 

  

ga expenses increased 102 million or 10 in 2005 including a 4 unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r a 1 unfavorable impact from the 53rd week and a 1 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the unfavorable impact of these factors general and administrative expenses increased 38 million or 4 the increase was driven by higher compensation related costs including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets and higher litigation related costs including charges of 16 million for the potential resolution of certain legal matters higher charitable contributions and expense associated with discontinuing certain corporate software development projects also contributed to the increase such increases were partially offset by reductions associated with operating restaurants which were refranchised in 2004 primarily the puerto rico business and the effect of lapping certain prior year reserve increases related to potential development sites and surplus facilities 

  

worldwide other income expense 

  

 

  

 

  

worldwide closure and impairment expenses and refranchising gain loss 

  

see the store portfolio strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and note 4 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment 

  

operating profit 

  

 

  

neither unallocated and corporate expenses which comprise ga expenses nor unallocated refranchising gain loss are allocated to the us international division or china division segments for performance reporting purposes the decrease in corporate and unallocated expenses in 2006 was driven by the lapping of the unfavorable impact of 2005 litigation related costs 

  

excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005 us operating profit increased 23 million or 3 in 2006 the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales on restaurant profit due to higher average guest check 

  

and franchise and license fees new unit development and lower closures and impairment expenses these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of refranchising higher ga expenses and a charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in 2006 the impact of lower commodity costs and lower property and casualty insurance expense on restaurant profit was largely offset by higher other restaurant costs including labor advertising and utilities 

  

us operating profit decreased 17 million or 2 in 2005 the decrease was driven by higher closures and impairment expenses and higher ga expenses these decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit was partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs a 3 unfavorable impact from the adoption of sfas 123r was offset by a 3 favorable impact from the 53rd week

china division operating profit increased 79 million or 37 in 2006 including a 4 favorable impact from currency translation the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit new unit development and an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates these increases were partially offset by higher ga expenses and the lapping of a prior year financial recovery from a supplier 

  

china division operating profit increased 6 million or 3 in 2005 the increase was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of new unit development and a financial recovery from a supplier these increases were partially offset by the impact on restaurant profit of same store sales declines a decrease in equity income from unconsolidated affiliates and increased general and administrative expense a 2 favorable impact from currency translation was offset by a 2 unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r 

  

interest expense net 

  

 

  

interest expense increased 25 million or 17 in 2006 the increase was driven by both an increase in interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt and increased borrowings as compared to prior year 

  

interest expense increased 2 million or 2 in 2005 an increase in our average interest rates was largely offset by a decrease in our bank fees attributable to an upgrade in our credit rating 

  

income taxes 

  

 

  

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 

  

 

  

our 2006 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular us audit cycle as well as certain outofyear adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by 22 percentage points the reversal of tax reserves was partially offset by valuation allowance additions on foreign tax credits for which as a result of the tax reserve reversals we currently believe we are not likely to utilize before they expire we also recognized deferred tax assets for the foreign tax credit impact of nonrecurring decisions to repatriate certain foreign earnings in 2007 however we provided full valuation allowances on such assets as we do not believe it is currently more likely than not that they will be realized we recognized the benefit of certain recurring foreign tax credits in amounts similar to prior years in 2006 

  

our 2005 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals for certain deferred tax assets whose realization became more likely than not as well as the recognition of certain nonrecurring foreign tax credits we were able to substantiate in 2005 the impact of these items was partially offset by tax expense associated with our 2005 decision to repatriate approximately 390 million in qualified foreign earnings these earnings as well as 110 million for which a determination was made to repatriate in 2004 were eligible for a dividends received deduction in accordance with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

our 2004 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular us audit cycle partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization was no longer considered more likely than not 

  

adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure 

  

consolidated cash flows 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 1302 million compared to 1238 million in 2005 the increase was driven by a higher net income lower pension contributions and a 2006 partial receipt of the settlement related to the 2005 mainland china supplier ingredient issue these factors were offset by higher income tax and interest payments in 2006 

  

in 2005 net cash provided by operating activities was 1238 million compared to 1186 million in 2004 the increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income including the noncash impact of the adoption of sfas 123r and lower income tax payments in 2005 partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of sfas 123r 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 476 million versus 345 million in 2005 the increase was driven by the current year acquisitions of the remaining interest in our pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate and the rostik’s brand and associated intellectual properties in russia the lapping of proceeds related to the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in our former polandczech republic unconsolidated affiliate also contributed to the increase these factors were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from refranchising in 2006 

  

in 2005 net cash used in investing activities was 345 million versus 541 million in 2004 the decrease was primarily driven by lower acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending higher proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment versus 2004 and the proceeds from the sale of our fifty percent interest in our former polandczech republic unconsolidated affiliate 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 673 million versus 832 million in 2005 the decrease was driven by an increase in net borrowings and lower share repurchases partially offset by a reduction in the excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and higher dividend payments 

  

in 2005 net cash used in financing activities was 832 million versus 779 million in 2004 the increase was driven primarily by higher share repurchases partially offset by net debt borrowings in 2005 versus net debt repayments in 2004 and the impact of excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of sfas 123r 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in each of the last five fiscal years net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized however we believe our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity would allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2007 and beyond 

  

discretionary spending 

  

during 2006 we invested 614 million in our businesses including approximately 331 million in the us 118 million for the international division and 165 million for the china division we also acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom unconsolidated affiliate for 178 million in cash 

  

for the second straight year we returned over 11 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends under the authority of our board of directors we repurchased 202 million shares of our common shares for 983 million during 2006 in september 2006 the board of directors authorized share repurchases of up to 500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through september 

  

2007 at december 30 2006 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to 469 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the september 2006 authorization 

  

during the year ended december 30 2006 we paid cash dividends of 144 million additionally on november 17 2006 and december 5 2006 our board of directors approved cash dividends of 015 and 030 respectively per share of common stock to be distributed on february 2 2007 and march 30 2007 respectively to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 12 2007 and march 9 2007 respectively 

  

for 2007 we estimate that capital spending will be approximately 650 million we also estimate that refranchising proceeds prior to taxes will total approximately 200 million in 2007 we also expect to provide returns to our shareholders through both significant share repurchases and dividends we are targeting a 3 to 4 reduction of our diluted share count in 2007 

  

borrowing capacity 

  

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in september 2009 the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness guarantees of indebtedness level of cash dividends aggregate nonus investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 30 2006 

  

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit at december 30 2006 our unused credit facility totaled 778 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 222 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 30 2006 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 035 to 1625 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or 000 to 020 over an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

  

in november 2005 we executed a fiveyear revolving credit facility totaling 350 million the “international credit facility” or “icf” on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum and by yum’s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the credit facility we were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of 2006 

  

there were borrowings of 174 million and available credit of 176 million outstanding under the icf at the end of 2006 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 020 to 120 over libor or 000 to 020 over a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

  

in 2006 we executed two shortterm borrowing arrangements the “term loans” on behalf of the international division there were borrowings of 183 million outstanding at the end of 2006 under the term loans both of which expired and were repaid in the first quarter of 2007 

  

the majority of our remaining longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2008 through 2016 and interest rates ranging from 625 to 888 the senior unsecured notes represent senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 16 billion at december 30 2006 this amount 

  

includes 300 million aggregate principal amount of 625 senior unsecured notes that were issued in april 2006 due april 15 2016 we used 200 million of these proceeds to repay our 85 senior unsecured notes that matured in april 2006 and the remainder for general corporate purposes 

  

contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 30 2006 included 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table our most significant plan the yum retirement plan the “us plan” is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain fulltime us salaried employees our funding policy with respect to the us plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the us plan’s funded status the us plan’s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of us plan assets based on current funding rules we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2007 but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the us plan’s expected september 30 2007 funded status during 2006 we made a 23 million discretionary contribution to the us plan none of which represented minimum funding requirements at our september 30 2006 measurement date our pension plans in the us which include the us plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan had a projected benefit obligation of 864 million and plan assets of 673 million 

  

the funding rules for our pension plans outside of the us vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates performance of plan assets local laws and tax regulations our most significant plans are in the uk including a plan for which we assumed full liability upon our purchase of the remaining fifty percent interest in our former pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate during 2006 we made a discretionary contribution of approximately 18 million to our kfc uk pension plan in anticipation of certain future funding requirements since our plan assets approximate our projected benefit obligation at yearend for this plan we do not anticipate any significant further near term funding the projected benefit obligation of our pizza hut uk pension plan exceeds plan assets by approximately 35 million we anticipate taking steps to reduce this deficit in the near term which could include a decision to partially 

  

or completely fund the deficit in 2007 however given the level of cash flows from operations the company anticipates generating in 2007 any funding decision would not materially impact our ability to maintain our planned levels of discretionary spending 

  

during 2006 congress passed the pension protection act of 2006 the act with the stated purpose of improving the funding of americas private pension plans the act introduces new funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans introduces benefit limitations for certain underfunded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions the act applies to pension plan years beginning after december 31 2007 and is applicable only to our us plan we have preliminarily reviewed the provisions of the act to determine the impact on the company required funding under the act will be dependent upon many factors including our us plans future funded status as well as discretionary contributions we may choose to make based upon this preliminary review as well as the current funded status of the us plan relative to our level of annual operating cash flows we do not believe that required contributions under the act would materially impact our operating cash flows in any one given year 

  

our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 4 million in 2006 see note 15 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 

  

we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” for which we are selfinsured employee healthcare and longterm disability claims for which we are selfinsured and income taxes and associated interest we may pay upon audit by tax authorities of tax returns previously filed the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee health longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled we provide reserves for potential tax and associated interest exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a substainable position on a matter contrary to our position 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we had provided approximately 16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the company’s historical refranchising programs and to a lesser extent franchisee development of new restaurants at december 30 2006 in support of these guarantees we posted letters of credit of 4 million we also provided a standby letter of credit of 18 million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately 75 million at december 30 2006 

  

any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss gain new loans added to the loan pools in 2006 were not significant 

  

our unconsolidated affiliates have approximately 29 million of shortterm debt outstanding as of december 30 2006 none of which is guaranteed by yum 

  

accounting pronouncements adopted in the fourth quarter of 2006 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” sab 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement for the purpose of a materiality assessment sab 108 requires that registrants quantify a current year misstatement using an approach that considers both the impact of prior year misstatements that remain on the balance sheet and those that were recorded in the current year income statement historically we quantified prior year misstatements and assessed materiality based on a current year income statement approach the transition provisions of sab 108 permitted the company to adjust for the cumulative effect of uncorrected prior year misstatements that were not material to any prior periods under our historical income statement approach but that were material under the guidance in 

  

sab 108 through retained earnings at the beginning of 2006 see note 2 for further discussion on the impact of adopting sab 108 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” sfas 158 required the company to recognize the funded status of its pension and postretirement plans in the december 30 2006 consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise in future years will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income to the extent they have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost the impact of adopting sfas 158 has been included in the company’s december 30 2006 consolidated balance sheet see notes 2 and 15 for further discussion of the impact of adopting sfas 158 

  

sfas 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of pension and postretirement plans as of the date of a company’s fiscal year end effective in the year ended 2008 certain of our plans currently have measurement dates that do not coincide with our fiscal year end and thus we will be required to change their measurement dates in 2008 

  

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

  

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the year beginning december 31 2006 for the company fin 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement upon adoption the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin 48 if any shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we do not currently anticipate that the adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we will record upon adoption of fin 48 will materially impact our financial condition 

  

fin 48 also requires that subsequent to initial adoption a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs currently we record such changes in judgment including audit settlements as a component of our annual effective rate thus our reported quarterly income tax rate may become more volatile upon adoption of fin 48 this change will not impact the manner in which we record income tax expense on an annual basis 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measures” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the year beginning december 30 2007 for the company we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas 157 to determine any impact for the company 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the year beginning december 30 2007 for the company we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas 159 to determine any impact for the company 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

  

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

  

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semiannual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value 

  

our semiannual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our semiannual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant which can be for a period of over 20 years and any terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 

  

if the longlived assets of a restaurant subject to our semiannual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows we write the assets down to their fair value this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows including terminal value of the restaurant at an appropriate rate the discount rate used is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 

  

we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform such impairment evaluations at the group level forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

  

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

  

we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the fair value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary in addition we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses the fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

  

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value the discount rate used in determining fair value is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 

  

  

we have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions these include trademarkbrand intangible assets for kfc ljs and aw we believe the value of a trademarkbrand is derived from the royalty we avoid in the case of company stores or receive in the case of franchise stores due to our ownership of the trademarkbrand we have determined that the kfc trademarkbrand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized our impairment test for the kfc trademarkbrand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount future sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the kfc trademarkbrand 

  

in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the kfc trademarkbrand we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans for 2006 there was no impairment of goodwill or the kfc trademarkbrand 

  

we have certain intangible assets such as the ljs and aw trademarkbrand intangible assets franchise contract rights reacquired franchise rights and favorable operating leases which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate we base the expected useful lives of reacquired franchise rights over a period for which we believe it is reasonable that we will operate a company restaurant in the trade area we base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term 

  

our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets 

  

allowances for franchise and license receivableslease guarantees   

  

we reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon predefined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due as a result of reserving using this methodology we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december 30 2006 

  

we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants such guarantees are subject to the requirements of sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” “sfas 145” we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 

  

if payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees at december 30 2006 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable the potential total exposure under such leases is significant with 336 million representing the present value discounted at our pretax cost of debt of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 30 2006 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and historically we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 

  

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

  

see note 22 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 

  

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

  

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

  

see note 22 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

  

pension plans   

  

certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans are in the us in accordance with our fourth quarter 2006 adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas 158 we have recorded the underfunded status of 191 million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2006 these us plans had projected benefit obligations “pbo” of 864 million and fair values of plan assets of 673 million 

  

the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo’s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates for our us plans we measured our pbo using a discount rate of 595 at september 30 2006 this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more highquality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 71 million at our measurement dates conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans’ pbo by approximately 77 million at our measurement dates 

  

the pension expense we will record in 2007 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement dates we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately 7 million to 59 million in 2007 the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial loss of 6 million in 2007 a 50 basis point change in our weighted average discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2007 us pension expense by approximately 13 million 

  

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on us plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets at september 30 2006 was 80 we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our 2007 us pension plan expense by approximately 6 million 

  

the losses our us plan assets have experienced along with a decrease in discount rates over time have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of 216 million in the us plans for purposes of determining 2006 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 30 million of previously unrecognized actuarial loss we will recognize approximately 24 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2007 given no change to our current assumptions actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2007 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 

  

see note 15 for further discussion of our pension and postretirement plans 

  

stock options and stock appreciation rights expense 

  

compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our specific weightedaverage assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 16 additionally under sfas 123r we are required to estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

  

in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r we determined that it was appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans historically approximately 20 of total options granted have been made under the rgm plan 

  

grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25 per year over four years we use a single weightedaverage expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by sfas 123r we revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis based on the results of this analysis we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives 

  

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r in 2005 we have traditionally based expected volatility on company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option subsequent to adoption we revaluated expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options based on this analysis our weighted average volatility used in the determination of fair value for 2006 grants was 31 

  

prior to our adoption of sfas 123r in 2005 we recorded reductions in expense due to prevesting forfeitures as they occurred in connection with the adoption of sfas 123r we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 45 of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately 20 of all awards granted to abovestore executives will be forfeited 

  

income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves   

  

at december 30 2006 we have a valuation allowance of 342 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefit of 331 million as well our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

  

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

  

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

  

at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 8 million and 7 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 would decrease approximately 32 million and 39 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 would decrease approximately 69 million and 59 million respectively fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately 48 of our operating profit in 2006 excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 14 billion as of december 30 2006 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific europe and the americas changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 operating profit would have decreased 78 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

  

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as on a limited basis commodity future and option contracts commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 did not significantly impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows

in each concept consumers can dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell kfc ljs and aw offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

  

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

  

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under the standard franchise agreement franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land building and equipment and purchasing signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

  

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including new products equipment and management techniques 

  

the company is actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding primarily in the us where two or more of its concepts are operated in a single unit by combining two or more restaurant concepts particularly those that have complementary daypart strengths in one location the company believes it can generate higher sales volumes from such units significantly improve returns on per unit investment and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater number of trade areas throughout the us through market planning initiatives encompassing all of its concepts the company has established and annually updates multiyear development plans by trade area to optimize franchise and company penetration of its concepts and to improve returns on its existing asset base the development of multibranded units may be limited in some instances by prior development andor territory rights granted to franchisees 

  

  

  

  

  

at yearend 2005 there were 3289 multibranded units in the worldwide system these units were comprised of 2548 units offering food products from two of the concepts a “2n1” 48 units offering food products from three of the concepts a “3n1” and 669 units offering food products from pizza hut and wingstreet a flavored chicken wings concept yum has developed 24 units offering food products from kfc and wing works another flavored chicken wings concept developed by yum

the company’s restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in the us the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant most of the employees work on a parttime basis we issue detailed manuals which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs covering all aspects of restaurant operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area coaches area coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants the company’s restaurants are visited from time to time by various senior operators who help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members 

  

rgms attend and complete their respective concepts’ required training programs these programs consist of initial training as well as additional continuing development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to time initial manager training programs generally last at least six weeks and emphasize leadership business management supervisory skills including training coaching and recruiting product preparation and production safety quality control customer service labor management and equipment maintenance

a small portion of pizza hut’s and ljs’s sales are attributable to the sale of beer and wine a license is required in most cases for each site that sells alcoholic beverages in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages relate to many aspects of restaurant operations including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages

the company continues to monitor its facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act “ada” in order to conform to its requirements under the ada the company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of disabled persons we believe that expenditures if required would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

  

international and china divisions  the company’s restaurants outside the us are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting the company’s us restaurants including laws and regulations concerning labor health sanitation and safety the international restaurants are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment international compliance with environmental requirements has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position

risk factors  

tableend   

we face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry including operational legal regulatory and product risks the following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business and our results of operations other factors may exist that the company cannot anticipate or that the company does not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available 

  

health concerns arising from outbreaks of avian flu may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

in 2004 and 2005 asian and european countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels while fullycooked chicken has been determined to be safe for consumption and while the company has taken and continues to take measures to anticipate and minimize the effect of these outbreaks on our business any further outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to shift their preferences in addition outbreaks on a widespread basis could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

  

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

the company considers food safety a top priority and dedicates substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and food safety issues have occurred in the past and could occur in the future if such instances of foodborne illness or other food safety issues were to occur whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors negative publicity could result which could adversely affect sales and profitability if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants additionally the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients finally like other companies in the restaurant industry some of our products may contain genetically engineered food products increased regulation of and opposition to genetically engineered food products have on occasion and may in the future force us to use alternative sources at increased costs 

  

our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

  

our restaurants are operated in numerous countries and territories and our foreign business is significant we intend to further expand our international operations over the next several years as a result our business and operations are 

  

  

  

subject to the risk of changes in economic conditions tax systems consumer preferences social conditions and political conditions inherent in foreign operations including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment in addition our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  

mainland china is one of our fastest developing markets any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations could adversely affect our china business our growing investments in our china operations will increase our exposure in this market many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china although management believes it has structured our china operations to comply with local laws there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property and contract rights in china our business would be adversely impacted 

  

changes in commodity and other operating costs or supply chain and business disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

while the company takes measures to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese and produce among others could adversely affect our operating results although we try to manage the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results we remain susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns product recalls labor disputes and government regulations in addition to food we purchase electricity oil and natural gas needed to operate our restaurants and suppliers purchase gasoline needed to transport food and supplies to us any significant increase in energy costs could adversely affect our business through higher rates and the imposition of fuel surcharges by our suppliers because we provide moderately priced food we may choose not to or be unable to pass along commodity price increases to our customers additionally significant increases in gasoline prices could result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants we rely on third party distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our stores interruption of distribution services due to financial distress or other issues could impact our operations our operating costs also include premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health which may increase over time thereby further increasing our costs finally our industry is susceptible to natural disasters which could result in restaurant closures and business disruptions 

  

our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts’ franchisees 

as a result of our franchising programs our operating results are dependent upon the sales volumes and viability of our franchisees any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us or be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them in addition franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules our franchisees generally depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants in some instances financing has been difficult to obtain for some operators any of these problems could slow our planned growth 

  

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

  

as a restaurant industry participant we are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or 

  

  

  

whether we are ultimately held liable such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a judgment for significant monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

  

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some guests we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and even if we are not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results 

  

changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations 

  

we and our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies requirements of local authorities with respect to zoning land use licensing permitting and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

  

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas the expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial 

  

we may not attain our target development goals 

  

we are pursuing a disciplined growth strategy which to be successful will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to upgrade existing restaurants and open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new upgraded or converted restaurants will be operated profitably further there is no assurance that any restaurant we open or convert will obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants the success of our planned expansion including our multibranding initiatives will depend upon numerous factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

the restaurant industry in which we operate is highly competitive 

  

the restaurant industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products new product development advertising levels and promotional initiatives customer service reputation restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties if our restaurants and franchised restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other restaurants in new and existing markets our business could be adversely affected in the restaurant industry labor is a primary operating cost component competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees in addition our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions disposable consumer income and consumer confidence adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing either of which could harm our results of operations

employees 

  

at any given time the company or its affiliates employ hundreds of thousands of persons primarily in its restaurants in addition each year thousands of persons seek employment with the company and its restaurants from time to time disputes arise regarding employee hiring compensation termination and promotion practices 

  

like other retail employers the company has been faced in a few states with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations 

  

on august 13 2003 a class action lawsuit against pizza hut inc entitled coldiron v pizza hut inc  was filed in the united states district court central district of california plaintiff alleges that she and other current and former pizza hut restaurant general managers “rgms” were improperly classified as exempt employees under the us fair labor standards act “flsa” there is also a pendent state law claim alleging that current and former rgms in california were misclassified under that state’s law plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime wages and penalties on may 5 2004 the district court granted conditional certification of a nationwide class of rgms under the flsa claim providing notice to prospective class members and an opportunity to join the class approximately 12 percent of the eligible class members have elected to join the litigation however on june 30 2005 the district court granted pizza hut’s motion to strike all flsa class members who joined the litigation after july 15 2004 the effect of this order is to reduce the number of flsa class members to only approximately 88 or approximately 25 of the eligible class members 

  

in november 2005 the parties agreed to a settlement pizza hut believes that definitive settlement documents will be preliminarily and finally approved by the court within sixty to ninety days following submission of the documents to the court we have provided for this settlement amount in our consolidated financial statements 

  

on november 26 2001 a lawsuit against long john silver’s inc “ljs” entitled kevin johnson on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v long john silver’s inc “johnson” was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee nashville division johnson’s suit alleged that ljs’s former “securityrestitution for 

  

  

  

losses” policy the “policy” provided for deductions from rgms and assistant restaurant general managers “argms” salaries that violate the salary basis test for exempt personnel under regulations issued pursuant to the flsa johnson alleged that all rgms and argms who were employed by ljs for the three year period prior to the lawsuit – ie since november 26 1998 – should be treated as the equivalent of hourly employees and thus were eligible under the flsa for overtime for any hours worked over 40 during all weeks in the recovery period in addition johnson claimed that the potential members of the class are entitled to certain liquidated damages and attorney’s fees under the flsa 

  

ljs believed that johnson’s claims as well as the claims of all other similarly situated parties should be resolved in individual arbitrations pursuant to ljs’s dispute resolution program “drp” and that a collective action to resolve these claims in court was clearly inappropriate under the current state of the law accordingly ljs moved to compel arbitration in the johnson case ljs and johnson also agreed to stay the action effective december 17 2001 pending mediation and entered into a tolling agreement for that purpose after mediation did not resolve the case and after limited discovery and a hearing the court determined on june 7 2004 that johnson’s individual claims should be referred to arbitration johnson appealed and the decision of the district court was affirmed in all respects by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on july 5 2005 

  

on december 19 2003 counsel for plaintiff in the above referenced johnson lawsuit filed a separate demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association “aaa” on behalf of former ljs managers erin cole and nick kaufman who reside in south carolina the “cole arbitration” claimants in the cole arbitration demand a class arbitration on behalf of the same putative class  and the same underlying flsa claims  as were alleged in the johnson lawsuit the complaint in the cole arbitration subsequently was amended to allege a practice of deductions distinct from the allegations as to the policy in violation of the flsa salary basis test and to add victoria mcwhorter another ljs former manager as an additional claimant ljs has denied the claims and the putative class alleged in the cole arbitration and it is ljs’s position that the claims of cole kaufman and mcwhorter should be individually arbitrated 

  

arbitrations under ljs’s drp including the cole arbitration are governed by the rules of the aaa in october 2003 the aaa adopted its supplementary rules for class arbitrations “aaa class rules” the aaa appointed an arbitrator for the cole arbitration on june 15 2004 the arbitrator issued a clause construction award ruling that the drp does not preclude class arbitration ljs moved to vacate the clause construction award in the united states district court for the district of south carolina on september 15 2005 the federal court in south carolina ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear ljs’s motion to vacate ljs has appealed the us district court’s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit while judicial review of the clause construction award was pending the arbitrator permitted claimants to move for a class determination award which was opposed by ljs on september 19 2005 the arbitrator issued a class determination award certifying a class of ljs’s rgms and argms employed between december 17 1998 and august 22 2004 on flsa claims to proceed on an optout basis under the aaa class rules that class determination award was upheld on appeal by the united states district court for the district of south carolina on january 20 2006 ljs has appealed the ruling of the us district court to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 

  

ljs believes that the drp provides for individual arbitrations ljs also believes that if the cole arbitration must proceed on a class basis i the proceedings should be governed by the optin collective action structure of the flsa ii a class should not be certified under the applicable provisions of the flsa and iii each individual should not be able to recover for more than two years and a maximum three years prior to the date they file a consent to join the arbitration we have provided for the estimated costs of the cole arbitration based on a projection of eligible claims the amount of each eligible claim the estimated legal fees incurred by the claimants and the results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters but in view of the novelties of proceeding under the aaa class rules and the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurance that the outcome of the arbitration will not result in losses in excess of those currently provided for 

  

on september 21 2005 a collective action lawsuit against the company and kfc corporation originally entitled parler v yum brands inc dba kfc and kfc corporation  was filed in the united states district court for the district of 

  

  

  

minnesota plaintiff alleges that he and other current and former kfc assistant unit managers “aum’s” were improperly classified as exempt employees under flsa plaintiff seeks overtime wages and liquidated damages on january 17 2006 the district court dismissed the claims against the company with prejudice leaving kfc corporation as the sole defendant notice will be mailed to current and former kfc aum’s advising them of the litigation and providing an opportunity to join the case if they choose to do so 

  

we believe that kfc has properly classified its aum’s as exempt under the flsa and accordingly intend to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit however in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of this case cannot be predicted at this time likewise the amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

customers 

  

the company’s restaurants serve a large and diverse crosssection of the public and in the course of serving so many people disputes arise regarding products service accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such as those of the company 

  

on december 17 2002 taco bell was named as the defendant in a class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california entitled moeller et al v taco bell corp on august 4 2003 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that alleges among other things that taco bell has discriminated against the class of people who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility by failing to make its approximately 220 companyowned restaurants in california the “california restaurants” accessible to the class plaintiffs contend that queue rails and other architectural and structural elements of the taco bell restaurants relating to the path of travel and use of the facilities by persons with mobilityrelated disabilities including parking spaces ramps counters restroom facilities and seating do not comply with the us americans with disabilities act the “ada” the unruh civil rights act the “unruh act” and the california disabled persons act the “cdpa” plaintiffs have requested a an injunction from the district court ordering taco bell to comply with the ada and its implementing regulations b that the district court declare taco bell in violation of the ada the unruh act and the cdpa and c monetary relief under the unruh act or cdpa plaintiffs on behalf of the class are seeking the minimum statutory damages per offense of either 4000 under the unruh act or 1000 under the cdpa for each aggrieved member of the class plaintiffs contend that there may be in excess of 100000 individuals in the class for themselves the four named plaintiffs have claimed aggregate minimum statutory damages of no less than 16000 but are expected to claim greater amounts based on the number of taco bell outlets they visited at which they claim to have suffered discrimination 

  

on february 23 2004 the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification the district court certified a rule 23b2 mandatory injunctive relief class of all individuals with disabilities who use wheelchairs or electric scooters for mobility who at any time on or after december 17 2001 were denied or are currently being denied on the basis of disability the full and equal enjoyment of the california restaurants the class includes claims for injunctive relief and minimum statutory damages 

  

pursuant to the parties’ agreement on or about august 31 2004 the district court ordered that the trial of this action be bifurcated so that stage one will resolve plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief and stage two will resolve plaintiffs’ claims for damages the parties are currently proceeding with the equitable relief stage of this action during this stage taco bell filed a motion to partially decertify the class to exclude from the rule 23b2 class claims for monetary damages the district court denied the motion plaintiffs filed their own motion for partial summary judgment as to liability relating to a subset of the california restaurants the district court denied that motion as well discovery is ongoing as of the date of this report 

  

taco bell has denied liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit although this lawsuit is at a relatively early stage in the proceedings it is likely that certain of the california restaurants will be determined to be not fully compliant with accessibility laws and that taco bell will be required to take certain steps to make those restaurants fully compliant however at this time it is not possible to estimate with reasonable certainty the potential 

  

  

  

costs to bring any non compliant california restaurants into compliance with applicable state and federal disability access laws nor is it possible at this time to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of liability for monetary damages on a class wide basis to taco bell 

  

intellectual property 

  

the company has registered trademarks and service marks many of which are of material importance to the company’s business from time to time the company may become involved in litigation to defend and protect its use of its registered marks 

  

other litigation 

  

on january 16 1998 a lawsuit against taco bell corp entitled wrench llc joseph shields and thomas rinks v taco bell corp “wrench” was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan the lawsuit alleged that taco bell corp misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising featuring a chihuahua the plaintiffs sought to recover monetary damages under several theories including breach of impliedinfact contract idea misappropriation conversion and unfair competition on june 10 1999 the district court granted summary judgment in favor of taco bell corp plaintiffs filed an appeal with the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit and oral arguments were held on september 20 2000 on july 6 2001 the sixth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court’s judgment in favor of taco bell corp and remanded the case to the district court taco bell corp unsuccessfully petitioned the sixth circuit court of appeals for rehearing en banc and its petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied on january 21 2002 the case was returned to district court for trial which began on may 14 2003 and on june 4 2003 the jury awarded 30 million to the plaintiffs subsequently the plaintiffs moved to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest and postjudgment interest and taco bell filed its posttrial motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on september 9 2003 the district court denied taco bells’ motion and granted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend the judgment 

  

in view of the jury verdict and subsequent district court ruling we recorded a charge of 42 million in 2003 we appealed the verdict to the sixth circuit court of appeals and interest continued to accrue during the appeal process prior to a ruling from the sixth circuit court of appeals we settled this matter with the wrench plaintiffs on january 15 2005 concurrent with the settlement with the plaintiffs we also settled the matter with certain of our insurance carriers as a result of these settlements reversals of previously recorded expense of 14 million were recorded in the year ended december 25 2004 we paid the settlement amount to the plaintiffs and received the insurance recovery during the first quarter of 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 we entered into a settlement agreement with another insurance carrier and as a result income of 2 million was recorded in the quarter 

  

we intend to seek additional recoveries from our other insurance carriers during the periods in question we have also filed suit against taco bell’s former advertising agency in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking reimbursement for the settlement amount as well as any costs that we have incurred in defending this matter the district court has issued a minute order granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment but has requested submissions from the defendant for its review before issuing a final order we believe that a grant by the district court of this summary judgment motion would be erroneous under the law we will evaluate our options once a final order has been issued any additional recoveries will be recorded as they are realized

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

introduction and overview 

  

yum brands inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as “yum” or the “company” comprises the worldwide operations of kfc pizza hut taco bell long john silver’s “ljs” and aw allamerican food restaurants “aw” collectively “the concepts” and is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on the number of system units ljs and aw were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants inc “ygr” on may 7 2002 yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us with over 13800 units yum became an independent publiclyowned company on october 6 1997 the “spinoff date” via a taxfree distribution of our common stock the “distribution” or “spinoff” to the shareholders of our former parent pepsico inc “pepsico” 

  

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

  

the retail food industry in which the company competes is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience location and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

  

our business consists of three reporting segments united states the international division and the china division the china division includes mainland china “china” thailand and kfc taiwan and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations 

  

the company’s key strategies are 

  

      

the company is focused on five longterm measures identified as essential to our growth and progress these five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows 

  

    

    

  

  

  

  

  

  

    

    

    

our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the management’s discussion and analysis “mda” 

  

throughout the mda the company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates we believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better yeartoyear comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 

  

this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages 56 through 59 and the cautionary statements on page 52 all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 60 through 96 tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified 

  

factors affecting comparability of 2005 results to 2004 results and 2004 results to 2003 results 

  

international reporting changes 

  

in 2005 we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure the china division includes mainland china “china” thailand and kfc taiwan and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations while this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation 

  

beginning in 2005 we also changed the china business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our us business previously our china business like the rest of our international businesses closed one month or one period for certain of our international businesses earlier than yum’s period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting to maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations amounts related to our china business for december 2004 have not been reflected in our consolidated statements of income and net income of the china business of 6 million for the one month period ending december 31 2004 was recognized as an adjustment directly to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended december 31 2005 our consolidated results of operations for the year to date ended december 31 2005 include the results of operations of the china business for the months of january 2005 through december 2005 our consolidated results of operations for the years to date ended december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 continue to include the results of operations of the china business for the months december 2003 through november 2004 and december 2002 through november 2003 respectively as previously reported 

  

  

  

  

  

  

adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” 

  

in the fourth quarter 2005 the company adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” supersedes apb 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” the provisions of sfas 123r are similar to those of sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all new modified and unvested sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straightline basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest 

 

we adopted sfas 123r using the modified retrospective application transition method effective september 4 2005 the beginning of our fourth quarter as permitted by sfas 123r we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption our fiscal year 2005 as such the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 are required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of sfas 123 however years prior to 2005 have not been restated 

  

the adoption of sfas 123r in 2005 resulted in the reduction of operating profit of 58 million 10 million in payroll and employee benefits and 48 million in general and administrative expense a reduction of net income of 38 million net of tax benefits of 20 million a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of 013 per share a reduction of 87 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of 87 million in cash flows from financing activities 

  

the following table shows the 2005 quarterly aftertax effect of adoption of sfas 123r on the previously reported first three quarters of 2005 

  

   

we also have included the following tables detailing the additional expense by quarter by segment and by financial statement line item of the impact of adoption of sfas 123r as well as the related decrease in operating profit income tax benefit and decrease in net income the numbers as presented have been rounded to accommodate our financial statement presentation conventions however unrounded expense by segment is relatively consistent throughout all quarters relative to actual number of days in the quarter 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

   

   

   

prior to 2005 all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb 25 and its related interpretations accordingly no stockbased employee compensation expense was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for stock options as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant had the company applied the fair value provisions of sfas 123 to stock options in 2004 and 2003 net income of 740 million and 617 million respectively would have been reduced by 37 million and 38 million respectively to 703 million and 579 million respectively additionally both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased 012 per share for both 2004 and 2003 

  

  

  

  

  

extra week in 2005 

  

our fiscal calendar results in a 53 rd week every five or six years fiscal year 2005 includes a 53 rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period as opposed to a monthly basis in the us we permanently accelerated the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december 2005 and thus there was no 53 rd week benefit for this business additionally all china division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53 rd week 

  

the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease of the 53 rd week on revenues and operating profit 

  

   

mainland china issues 

  

our kfc business in mainland china was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late march 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to avian flu in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the aforementioned issues the china division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11 excluding foreign currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 22 during the year to date ended december 31 2005 we entered into an agreement for a partial recovery of our losses related to the supplier ingredient issue with the supplier as a result of the agreement we recognized approximately 24 million in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

sale of an investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

  

during the second quarter of 2005 we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all kfcs and pizza huts in poland and the czech republic to our then partner in the entity principally for cash concurrent with the sale our former partner completed an initial public offering “ipo” of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity prior to the sale we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method subsequent to the ipo the new publicly held entity in which yum has no ownership interest is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest 

  

this transaction generated a onetime gain of approximately 11 million for yum as cash proceeds net of expenses of approximately 25 million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate as with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates the approximate 11 million gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statements of income 

  

the sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2005 nor is it expected to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations going forward 

  

  

  

  

  

  

hurricane katrina 

  

during the third quarter of 2005 hurricane katrina caused significant damage to several company and franchised stores this storm resulted in approximately 4 million of onetime costs being recorded in the full year from property damage and asset writeoffs related to company restaurants additionally during midseptember 2005 hurricane rita caused further damage to company and franchised stores though to a lesser extent than hurricane katrina we estimate that lost operating profits in 2005 as a result of stores being closed due to the effects of these hurricanes was approximately 3 million we do not expect insurance recoveries if any related to the hurricanes to be significant 

  

in the fourth quarter we experienced utility costs in the us that were approximately 10 million higher than in the prior year which we believe were at least partially attributable to these hurricanes we expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of 2006 with yearoveryear utility inflation of approximately 20 percent or approximately 7 million 

  

sale of puerto rico business   

  

our puerto rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of 2002 and was sold on october 4 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value company sales and restaurant profit decreased 159 million and 29 million respectively franchise fees increased 10 million and general and administrative expenses decreased 9 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 25 2004 company sales and restaurant profit decreased 27 million and 4 million respectively franchise fees increased 1 million and general and administrative expenses decreased 1 million for the year ended december 25 2004 as compared to the year ended december 27 2003 

  

income tax impact of repatriating qualified foreign earnings 

  

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” which became law on october 22 2004 allows a dividends received deduction of 85 of repatriated qualified foreign earnings in fiscal year 2005 we recorded 6 million in income tax expense during the year ended december 25 2004 as a result of our then determination to repatriate approximately 110 million in 2005 which will be eligible for the act’s dividends received deduction in accordance with fasb staff position 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of 2004” we continued to evaluate in 2005 whether we would repatriate other undistributed earnings from foreign investments as a result of the act during the second quarter of 2005 we determined that we would repatriate additional qualified foreign earnings of approximately 390 million in fiscal year 2005 which will be eligible for the act’s dividends received deduction for a total repatriation of qualified earnings of approximately 500 million as a result of this determination approximately 20 million of additional tax expense was recognized in fiscal 2005 no additional amounts beyond the approximately 500 million as discussed above are eligible for the act’s dividends received deduction 

  

lease accounting adjustments 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease including options in some instances over which we were recording rent expense including escalations on a straightline basis 

  

the cumulative adjustment primarily through increased us depreciation expense totaled 115 million 7 million after tax the portion of this adjustment that related to 2004 was approximately 3 million as the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 consolidated financial statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

amendment of saleleaseback agreements 

  

on august 15 2003 we amended two saleleaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of ygr such that the agreements now qualify for saleleaseback accounting restaurant profit decreased by 5 million in 2004 versus 2003 as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment the decrease in restaurant profit was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense 

  

canada unconsolidated affiliate dissolution 

  

on november 10 2003 we dissolved our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated 733 restaurants in canada we owned 50 of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method of the restaurants previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate we now operate the vast majority of pizza huts and taco bells while almost all kfcs are operated by franchisees as a result of operating certain restaurants that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate our company sales restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses increased and our franchise fees decreased in 2004 versus 2003 additionally on a full year basis other income increased as we recorded a loss from our investment in the canadian unconsolidated affiliate in 2003 

  

as a result of the dissolution of our canadian unconsolidated affiliate company sales increased 147 million franchise fees decreased 9 million restaurant profit increased 8 million general and administrative expenses increased 11 million and other income increased 4 million for the year ended december 25 2004 compared to the year ended december 27 2003 the impact on 2004 net income was not significant 

  

commodity inflation 

  

higher commodity costs particularly in cheese and meat prices negatively impacted us restaurant margins as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points for the year ended 2004 versus the year ended 2003 

  

wrench litigation 

  

we recorded income of 2 million and 14 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively and expense of 42 million in 2003 see note 4 for a discussion of the wrench litigation 

  

ameriserve and other charges credits 

  

we recorded income of 2 million 16 million and 26 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively see note 4 for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits 

  

store portfolio strategy 

  

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets such refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 

  

the following table summarizes our refranchising activities 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

in addition to our refranchising program from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively “store closures” store closure costs income includes the net of gains or losses on sales of real estate on which we are not currently operating a company restaurant lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves and other facilityrelated expenses from previously closed stores 

  

the following table summarizes company store closure activities 

  

   

the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and company store closures is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and general and administrative expenses and b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year the amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit

restaurant unit activity 

  

   

  

  

the above total excludes 2376 and 2345 licensed units at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively balances at the end of 2004 for the worldwide and china unit activity have been adjusted to include december activity in mainland china due to the change in its reporting calendar the net change was an addition of 16 2 1 and 19 units for company unconsolidated franchisees and total respectively 

  

   

the above total excludes 2181 and 2139 licensed units at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

   

the above totals exclude 195 and 206 licensed units at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

  

  

  

   

there are no licensed units in the china division 

  

included in the above totals are multibrand restaurants multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count similarly a new multibrand restaurant while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands results in just one additional unit count franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units multibrand restaurant totals were as follows 

  

   

   

for 2005 and 2004 company multibrand unit gross additions were 373 and 384 respectively for 2005 and 2004 franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 171 and 169 respectively there are no multibrand units in the china division 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

system sales growth 

  

   

system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including companyowned franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales of franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company typically at a rate of 4 to 6 of sales franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income however the franchise and license fees are included in the company’s revenues we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development

company restaurant margins 

  

   

   

   

in 2005 us restaurant margins as a percentage of sales were flat compared to 2004 the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by higher occupancy and other costs higher occupancy and other costs were driven by increases in utility costs and advertising costs a favorable impact from the 53 rd week 13 basis points was offset by the unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r 17 basis points 

  

in 2004 the decrease in us restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by higher food and paper costs and higher occupancy and other costs partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin higher food and paper costs were primarily driven by increased commodity costs principally cheese and meats and higher occupancy and other costs were primarily driven by increased expense resulting from the adjustment related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements 

  

in 2005 the decrease in the international division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales included a 51 basis point unfavorable impact of refranchising our restaurants in puerto rico also contributing to the decrease were higher occupancy and other costs and higher labor costs the decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin the unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r 10 basis points was largely offset by the favorable impact of the 53 rd week 8 basis points 

  

in 2004 international division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales were flat compared to 2003 the favorable impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by a 68 basis point unfavorable impact of operating certain restaurants in canada which is a market with below average margins that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate 

  

in 2005 china division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales decreased the decrease was driven by the impact on 

  

  

  

restaurant margin of same store sales declines related to the mainland china supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to avian flu and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs the decrease was partially offset by the impact on restaurant margin of lower food and paper costs principally due to supply chain savings initiatives 

  

in 2004 the increase in china division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of lower food and paper costs principally due to supply chain savings initiatives and same store sales growth on restaurant margin the increase was partially offset by higher labor costs and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation 

  

worldwide general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 102 million or 10 in 2005 including a 4 unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r a 1 unfavorable impact from the 53 rd week and a 1 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the unfavorable impact of these factors general and administrative expenses increased 38 million or 4 the increase was driven by higher compensation related costs including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets and higher litigation related costs including charges of 16 million for the potential resolution of certain legal matters higher charitable contributions and expense associated with discontinuing certain corporate software development projects also contributed to the increase such increases were partially offset by reductions associated with operating restaurants which were refranchised in 2004 primarily the puerto rico business and the effect of lapping certain prior year reserve increases related to potential development sites and surplus facilities 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 111 million or 12 in 2004 including a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by higher compensation related costs including incentive compensation amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets and pension costs also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees and increased reserves related to potential development sites and surplus facilities the increase was also partially attributable to expenses of 11 million associated with operating the restaurants we now own in canada that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate these increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses due to the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants 

  

worldwide franchise and license expenses 

  

franchise and license expenses increased 7 million or 24 in 2005 the increase was driven by higher franchisee support costs and higher provisions for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables 

  

franchise and license expenses decreased 2 million or 8 in 2004 the decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lapping the biennial international franchise convention held in 2003 

  

worldwide other income expense 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

other income increased 25 million or 44 in 2005 including a 1 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by a 24 million partial financial recovery 4 million of which was recognized through equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates from a supplier related to an ingredient issue in mainland china see note 7 other income was also positively impacted in 2005 by a 11 million gain associated with the sale of our investment in our polandczech republic unconsolidated affiliate 

  

other income increased 14 million or 34 in 2004 including a 7 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase was driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates principally in china and the dissolution of our unconsolidated affiliate in canada which recorded a loss for the year ended december 27 2003 

  

worldwide facility actions 

  

we recorded a net loss from facility actions of 19 million 26 million and 36 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively see the store portfolio strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and note 4 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment 

  

operating profit 

  

   

unallocated and corporate expenses comprise general and administrative expenses and unallocated facility actions comprise refranchising gains losses neither of which are allocated to the us international division or china division segments for performance reporting purposes unallocated other income expense in 2005 primarily comprises the 11 million gain on the sale of our investment in our polandczech republic unconsolidated affiliate which we did not allocate to the international division for performance reporting purposes 

  

us operating profit decreased 17 million or 2 in 2005 the decrease was driven by higher facility actions expense and higher general and administrative expense these decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit was partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs a 3 unfavorable impact from the adoption of sfas 123r was offset by a 3 favorable impact from the 53 rd week 

  

in 2004 the decrease in us operating profit was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of higher commodity costs primarily cheese and meat and the adjustment recorded related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements as well as higher general and administrative expenses the decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees 

  

international division operating profit increased 35 million or 11 in 2005 including a 4 favorable impact from foreign currency translation a 2 favorable impact from the 53 rd week and a 4 unfavorable impact from the adoption of sfas 123r excluding the net favorable impact from these factors international division operating profit increased 31 million or 9 in 2005 the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and 

  

  

  

franchise and license fees the impact of new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit and lower facility actions expense these increases were partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs higher labor costs and the impact on operating profit of refranchising our restaurants in puerto rico 

  

excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation international division operating profit increased 12 in 2004 the increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees new unit development and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates partially offset by higher general and administrative costs 

  

china division operating profit increased 6 million or 3 in 2005 the increase was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of new unit development and a financial recovery from a supplier these increases were partially offset by the impact on restaurant profit of same store sales declines a decrease in equity income from unconsolidated affiliates and increased general and administrative expense a 2 favorable impact from foreign currency translation was offset by a 2 unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas 123r 

  

in 2004 the increase in china division operating profit was driven by new unit development the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates partially offset by higher general and administrative costs 

  

interest expense net 

  

   

interest expense increased 2 million or 2 in 2005 an increase in our average interest rates was largely offset by a decrease in our bank fees attributable to the upgrade in our credit rating 

  

interest expense decreased 40 million or 22 in 2004 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our average interest rates primarily attributable to payvariable interest rate swaps entered into during 2004 also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the amended ygr sale leaseback agreement and lower international short term borrowings 

  

income taxes 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below 

  

   

income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately 1 million on the 2 million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended december 27 2003 due to the adoption of sfas 143 

  

the 2005 effective tax rate decreased 21 percentage points to 258 the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors including the impact of year over year valuation allowances adjustments as well as the recognition of certain foreign tax credits that we were able to substantiate in 2005 the decrease was partially offset by the impact of year over year adjustments to reserves and prior years and tax provided on foreign earnings which were repatriated to the us in 2005 

  

the 2004 effective tax rate decreased 23 percentage points to 279 the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors including the reversal of reserves in the current year associated with audits that were settled as well as the effects of certain international tax planning strategies implemented in 2004 the decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping the benefit in 2003 of amending certain prior us income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years as well as the recognition in 2004 of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not 

  

adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure

net cash provided by operating activities was 1238 million compared to 1186 million in 2004 the increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income including the noncash impact of the adoption of sfas 123r and lower income tax payments in 2005 partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of sfas 123r 

  

in 2004 net cash provided by operating activities was 1186 million compared to 1099 million in 2003 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income and a decrease in the amount of voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan compared to 2003 partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2004 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 345 million versus 541 million in 2004 the decrease was driven primarily by lower acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending the impact of the timing of purchases and sales 

  

  

  

of shortterm investments higher proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment versus 2004 and the proceeds from the sale of our polandczech republic unconsolidated affiliate 

  

in 2004 net cash used in investing activities was 541 million versus 565 million in 2003 the decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital spending compared to 2003 partially offset by the impact of the timing of purchases and sales of short–term investments 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 832 million versus 779 million in 2004 the increase was driven primarily by higher share repurchases partially offset by net debt borrowings in 2005 versus net debt repayments in 2004 and the impact of excess tax benefits classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of sfas 123r 

  

in 2004 net cash used in financing activities was 779 million versus 475 million in 2003 the increase in 2004 was primarily driven by higher share repurchases higher net debt repayments and the payment of two quarterly dividends partially offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises 

  

  

  

  

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in each of the last four fiscal years net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion these cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending while at the same time reducing our longterm debt balances we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations we believe our operating cash flows our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2006 and beyond 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we paid cash dividends of 123 million additionally on november 18 2005 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0115 per share of common stock to be distributed on february 3 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 13 2006 on an annual basis the company is targeting an annual payout ratio of 15 to 20 of net income 

  

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in september 2009 the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness guarantees of indebtedness level of cash dividends aggregate nonus investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2005 

  

under the terms of the credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2005 our unused credit facility totaled 809 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 191 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2005 the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 035 to 1625 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or 000 to 020 over an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable depends on our performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 

  

additionally on november 8 2005 we executed a fiveyear revolving credit facility the “international credit facility” or “icf” on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries the total facility amount is 350 million with separate sublimits for each of the three subsidiaries the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum and by yum’s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the credit facility we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2005 

  

there were borrowings of 180 million and available credit of 170 million outstanding under the icf at the end of 2005 the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from 020 to 120 over libor or 000 to 020 over a canadian alternate base rate which is the greater of the citibank na canadian branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “canadian dollar offered rate” plus 050 the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate as applicable depends upon yum’s performance under specified financial criteria interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 

  

the remainder of our longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 15 billion at december 31 2005 included in shortterm borrowings at december 31 2005 are 200 million in senior unsecured notes with an april 2006 maturity date the remaining 13 billion in senior unsecured notes comprise the majority of our longterm debt 

  

we estimate that in 2006 capital spending including acquisitions of our restaurants from franchisees will be approximately 675 million we also estimate that in 2006 refranchising proceeds prior to taxes will be approximately 

  

  

  

150 million employee stock options proceeds prior to taxes will be approximately 150 million and sales of property plant and equipment will be approximately 50 million 

  

in november 2005 the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through november 2006 at december 31 2005 we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to 469 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the november program 

  

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 31 2005 included 

  

   

   

   

   

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan’s funded status the pension plan’s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets based on current funding rules we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2006 but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plan’s expected september 30 2006 funded status during 2005 we made a 65 million discretionary contribution to our funded plan none of which represented minimum funding requirements our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 4 million in 2005 

  

also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers’ compensation employment practices liability general liability automobile liability and property losses collectively “property and casualty losses” as well as employee healthcare and longterm disability claims for which we are selfinsured the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee health longterm disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we had provided approximately 16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the company’s historical refranchising programs and to a lesser extent franchisee development of new restaurants at december 31 2005 in support of these guarantees we posted letters of credit of 4 million we also provided a standby letter of credit of 18 million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately 77 million at december 31 2005 

  

any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss gain new loans added to the loan pools in 2005 were not significant 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 

  

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

  

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semiannual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value 

  

our semiannual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our semiannual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant which can be for a period of over 20 years and any terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 

  

if the longlived assets of a restaurant subject to our semiannual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows we write the assets down to their fair value this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows including terminal value of the restaurant at an appropriate rate the discount rate used is our cost of capital adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist 

  

we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform such impairment evaluations at the group level forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

  

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

  

we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary in addition we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to our semi 

  

  

  

annual test for impairment of our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants the fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

  

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value 

  

we have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions these include trademarkbrand intangible assets for kfc ljs and aw we believe the value of a trademarkbrand is derived from the royalty we avoid in the case of company stores or receive in the case of franchise stores due to our ownership of the trademarkbrand we have determined that the kfc trademarkbrand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized our impairment test for the kfc trademarkbrand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount anticipated sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the kfc trademarkbrand 

  

in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the kfc trademarkbrand we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans for 2005 there was no impairment of goodwill or the kfc trademarkbrand 

  

we have certain intangible assets such as the ljs and aw trademarkbrand intangible assets franchise contract rights and favorable operating leases which are amortized over their expected useful lives we base the expected useful lives of our trademarkbrand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate we base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term 

  

our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted cash flows for purposes of our impairment analysis we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets 

  

allowances for franchise and license receivableslease guarantees   

  

we reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon predefined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due as a result of reserving using this methodology we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december 31 2005 

  

we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants such guarantees are subject to the requirements of sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” “sfas 145” we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable the fair 

  

  

  

value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 

  

if payment on the guarantee ever becomes probable and estimable we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees at december 31 2005 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable the potential total exposure under such leases is significant with 316 million representing the present value discounted at our pretax cost of debt of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 31 2005 current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and historically we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 

  

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 

  

see note 21 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 

  

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

  

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty losses the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 

  

see note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs 

  

pension plans   

  

certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after september 30 2001 are not eligible to participate as of our september 30 2005 measurement date these plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 815 million an accumulated benefit obligation “abo” of 736 million and a fair value of plan assets of 610 million as a result of the 126 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the abo at september 30 2005 and an additional 10 million contribution to the plans made subsequent to the measurement date but prior to december 31 2005 we have recorded a cumulative 110 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax of 66 million as of december 31 2005 

  

the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of 575 at september 30 2005 this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary the basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more highquality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans in considering possible bond portfolios the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the benefit cash flows for that year such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate oneyear forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately 69 million at september 30 2005 conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately 77 million at september 30 2005 

  

  

  

  

  

the pension expense we will record in 2006 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at september 30 2005 in total we expect pension expense to increase approximately 10 million to 66 million in 2006 the increase is primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial loss of 8 million in 2006 a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 575 at september 30 2005 would impact our 2006 pension expense by approximately 13 million 

  

the assumption we make regarding our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the weightedaverage of historical returns for each asset category adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions our expected longterm rate of return was lowered to 80 from 85 in connection with our september 30 2005 valuation we believe this revision was appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon including those experienced in calendar year 2005 this change did not impact our reported pension expense for 2005 but will increase our 2006 expense by approximately 3 million 

  

the losses our plan assets have experienced along with the decrease in discount rates have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of 256 million in our plans as of september 30 2005 for purposes of determining 2005 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 22 million of unrecognized actuarial loss we will recognize approximately 30 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2006 given no change to the assumptions at our september 30 2005 measurement date actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2006 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 

  

see note 14 for further discussion of our pension and postretirement plans 

  

income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves 

  

at december 31 2005 we have a valuation allowance of 233 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of 223 million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

  

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

  

see note 19 for a further discussion of our income taxes 

  

stock option expense 

  

compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model our specific weightedaverage assumptions for the riskfree interest rate expected term expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note 15 additionally under sfas 123r we are required to estimate prevesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 

  

in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r we determined that it was appropriate to group our stock option grants into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected life and prevesting forfeitures these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurantlevel employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the “rgm 

  

  

  

plan” and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans historically approximately 20 of total options granted have been made under the rgm plan 

  

we have traditionally used six years as the expected term of all stock option grants in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r and the increasing amount of historical data we now possess with regard to stock option exercise activity we revaluated our expected term assumptions based on historical exercise and postvesting employment termination behavior we determined that the expected life for options granted under the rgm plan was five years for options granted to our abovestore executives we determined that an expected life of six years was appropriate 

  

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we have traditionally based expected volatility on company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option we are in the process of revaluating expected volatility including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas 123r in the fourth quarter of 2005 were not significant 

  

prior to our adoption of sfas 123r we recorded reductions in expense due to prevesting forfeitures as they occurred in connection with the adoption of sfas 123r we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data based on such data we believe that approximately 45 of all options granted under the rgm plan which typically vest on a cliffbasis after four years will be forfeited while approximately 19 of options granted to abovestore executives which typically vest 25 per year over four years will be forfeited an insignificant transition adjustment was recorded upon the adoption of sfas 123r for the difference between actual and estimated forfeitures for the first three quarters of 2005 which we restated under the modified retrospective transition method

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

  

at december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 7 million and 6 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 would decrease approximately 39 million and 51 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 would decrease approximately 59 million and 76 million respectively fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately 43 of our operating profit in 2005 excluding unallocated income expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 13 billion as of december 31 2005 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific the americas and europe changes in foreign 

  

  

  

currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 operating profit would have decreased 70 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 

  

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany shortterm receivables and payables the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as on a limited basis commodity future and option contracts commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 did not significantly impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

cautionary statements 

  

from time to time in both written reports and oral statements we present “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the statements include those identified by such words as “may” “will” “expect” “project” “anticipate” “believe” “plan” and other similar terminology these “forwardlooking statements” reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements actual results involve risks and uncertainties including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry and could differ materially from expectations accordingly you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements 

  

company risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to changes in effective tax rates potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores unexpected disruptions in our supply chain effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the company the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing and advertising and promotional efforts our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees the success of our refranchising strategy the success of our strategies for international development and operations volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies

introduction and overview 

yum brands inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as “yum” or the “company” comprises the worldwide operations of kfc pizza hut taco bell long john silver’s “ljs” and aw allamerican food restaurants “aw” collectively “the concepts” and is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on the number of system units ljs and aw were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants inc “ygr” on may 7 2002 with 12998 international units yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us yum became an independent publiclyowned company on october 6 1997 the “spinoff date” via a taxfree distribution of our common stock the “distribution” or “spinoff” to the shareholders of our former parent pepsico inc “pepsico” 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient

tablestart the losses our plan assets have experienced along with the decrease in discount rates have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of 225 million in our plans as of september 30 2004 for purposes of determining 2004 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 19 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2004 we will recognize approximately 22 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2005 given no change to the assumptions at our september 30 2004 measurement date actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2005 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 

income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves 

at december 25 2004 we have a valuation allowance of 351 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of 231 million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events including audit settlements that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 

see note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

at december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result over the following twelvemonth period in a reduction of approximately 6 million and 3 million respectively in income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 would decrease approximately 51 million and 5 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 would decrease approximately 76 million and 87 million respectively fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows

like other retail employers the company has been faced in a few states with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations

on august 29 1997 a class action lawsuit against taco bell corp entitled bravo et al v taco bell corp “bravo” was filed in the circuit court of the state of oregon of the county of multnomah the lawsuit was filed by two former taco bell shift managers purporting to represent approximately 17000 current and former hourly employees statewide the lawsuit alleged violations of state wage and hour laws principally involving unpaid wages including overtime and rest and meal period violations and sought an unspecified amount in damages under oregon class action procedures taco bell was allowed an opportunity to “cure” the unpaid wage and hour allegations by opening a claims process to all putative class members prior to certification of the class in this cure process taco bell paid out less than 1 million on january 26 1999 the court certified a class of all current and former shift managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged violations a courtapproved notice and claim form was mailed to approximately 14500 class members on january 31 2000 trial began on january 4 2001 on march 9 2001 the jury reached verdicts on the substantive issues in this matter a number of these verdicts were in favor of the taco bell position however certain issues were decided in favor of the plaintiffs in april 2002 a jury trial to determine the damages of 93 of those claimants found that taco bell failed to pay for certain meal breaks andor offtheclock work for 86 of the 93 claimants

however the total amount of hours awarded by the jury was substantially less than that sought by the claimants in july and september 2002 the court ruled on several posttrial motions including fixing the total number of potential claimants at 1031 including the 93 claimants for which damages had already been determined and holding that claimants who prevail are entitled to prejudgment interest and penalty wages the second damages trial for the remaining 938 claimants began on july 7 2003 before the trial concluded the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter in full the court granted final approval of the settlement on december 23 2003 and final judgment of dismissal was entered on december 26 2003 payments to class counsel and eligible claimants were made in the first quarter of 2004 we have previously provided for the costs of this settlement as ameriserve and other charges credits

customers 

the company’s restaurants serve a large and diverse crosssection of the public and in the course of serving so many people disputes arise regarding products service accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such as those of the company

intellectual property 

the company has registered trademarks and service marks many of which are of material importance to the company’s business from time to time the company may become involved in litigation to defend and protect its use of its registered marks

other litigation 

on january 16 1998 a lawsuit against taco bell corp entitled wrench llc joseph shields and thomas rinks v taco bell corp was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan the lawsuit alleged that taco bell corp misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising featuring a chihuahua the plaintiffs sought to recover monetary damages under several theories including breach of impliedinfact contract idea misappropriation conversion and unfair competition on june 10 1999 the district court granted summary judgment in favor of taco bell corp plaintiffs filed an appeal with the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit the “court of appeals” and oral arguments were held on september 20 2000 on july 6 2001 the court of appeals reversed the district court’s judgment in favor of taco bell corp and remanded the case to the district court taco bell corp unsuccessfully petitioned the court of appeals for rehearing en banc and its petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied on january 21 2002 the case was returned to district court for trial which began on may 14 2003 and on june 4 2003 the jury awarded 30 million to the plaintiffs subsequently the plaintiffs’ moved to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest and postjudgment interest and taco bell filed its posttrial motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on september 9 2003 the district court denied taco bell’s motion and granted the plaintiff’s motion to amend the judgment

in view of the jury verdict and subsequent district court ruling we recorded a charge of 42 million in 2003 we continue to believe that the wrench plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and have appealed the verdict to the sixth circuit court of appeals postjudgment interest will continue to accrue during the appeal process

on july 9 2003 we filed suit against taco bell’s former advertising agency in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking reimbursement for any final award that may be ultimately affirmed by the appeals courts and costs that we have incurred in defending this matter we are also seeking reimbursement from our insurance carriers

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction and overview 

yum brands inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as “yum” or the “company” comprises the worldwide operations of kfc pizza hut taco bell long john silver’s “ljs” and aw allamerican food restaurants “aw”collectively “the concepts” and is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on the number of system units ljs and aw were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants inc “ygr” on may 7 2002 with 12377 international units yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us yum became an independent publiclyowned company on october 6 1997 the “spinoff date” via a taxfree distribution of our common stock the “distribution” or “spinoff” to the shareholders of our former parent pepsico inc “pepsico”

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient

the retail food industry in which the company competes is made up of supermarkets supercenters warehouse stores convenience stores coffee shops snack bars delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience location and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions currency fluctuations demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing food retailers and products and disposable purchasing power each of the concepts compete with international national and regional restaurant chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for management and hourly personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees

the company is focused on five longterm measures identified as essential to our growth and progress these five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows

international expansion international systemsales growth local currency number of new international restaurant openings net international unit growth multibrand innovation and expansion number of multibrand restaurant locations number of multibrand units added number of franchise multibrand units added portfolio of categoryleading us brands us blended samestore sales growth us systemsales growth global franchise fees new restaurant openings by franchisees franchise fee growth 17

factors affecting comparability of 2003 results to 2002 results and 2002 results to 2001 results 

ygr acquisition 

on may 7 2002 the company completed its acquisition of ygr the parent company of ljs and aw see note 4 for a discussion of the acquisition

as of the date of the acquisition ygr consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise ljs units respectively and 127 and 742 company and franchise aw units respectively in addition 133 multibranded ljsaw restaurants were included in the ljs unit totals except as discussed in certain sections of the mda the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in 2003 and 2002 was not significant relative to the comparable prior year period

amendment of saleleaseback agreements 

as discussed in note 14 on august 15 2003 we amended two saleleaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of ygr such that the agreements now qualify for saleleaseback accounting there was no gain or loss recorded as a result of this transaction however restaurant margins decreased by approximately 3 million for the year ended december 27 2003 as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment the decrease in restaurant margin was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense

wrench litigation 

we recorded expense of 42 million in 2003 see note 24 for a discussion of the wrench litigation

ameriserve and other charges credits 

we recorded income of 26 million in 2003 27 million in 2002 and 3 million in 2001 see note 7 for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits

store portfolio strategy 

from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets such refranchisings reduce our reported company sales and restaurant profits while increasing our franchise fees proceeds from refranchising increase the level of cash available to fund discretionary spending

the following table summarizes our refranchising activities

  in addition to our refranchising program from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively “store closures”

the following table summarizes company store closure activities

 the impact on operating profit arising from our refranchising and company store closures is the net of a the estimated reduction in restaurant profit which reflects the decrease in company sales and general and administrative expenses and b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year the amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we open in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit

the following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising and company store closures

  19

the following table summarizes the estimated impact on operating profit of refranchising and company store closures

  impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

effective december 30 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” in its entirety in accordance with the requirements of sfas 142 we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles as of december 30 2001 the following table summarizes the favorable effect of sfas 142 on restaurant profit restaurant margin and operating profit had sfas 142 been effective in 2001

 additionally if sfas 142 had been effective in 2001 reported net income would have increased approximately 26 million and diluted earnings per common share “eps” would have increased 009

sfas 142 requires that goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or as impairment indicators exist in accordance with this requirement we recognized impairment of approximately 5 million in both 2003 and 2002

worldwide results of operations 

  worldwide restaurant unit activity 

  21

 the franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count similarly a new multibrand restaurant while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands results in just one additional unit count

for 2003 and 2002 company multibrand unit gross additions were 235 and 216 respectively for 2003 and 2002 franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 194 and 166 respectively

worldwide system sales growth 

 system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including companyowned franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales of franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company typically at a rate of 4 to 6 of sales franchise unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income however the fees are included in the company’s revenues we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development

system sales increased 7 for 2003 after a 2 favorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the favorable impact of both foreign currency translation and the ygr acquisition system sales increased 3 the increase was driven by new unit development partially offset by store closures

franchise and license fees increased 73 million or 9 in 2003 after a 3 favorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the ygr acquisition franchise and license fees increased 5 the increase was driven by new unit development royalty rate increases and same store sales growth partially offset by store closures

company sales increased 753 million or 12 in 2002 the impact from foreign currency translation was not significant excluding the favorable impact of the ygr acquisition company sales increased 6 the increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth the increase was partially offset by refranchising and store closures

restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 120 basis points in 2002 the increase included the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of sfas 142 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 15 basis points from the ygr acquisition us restaurant margin increased approximately 80 basis points and international restaurant margin increased approximately 210 basis points

the changes in us and international restaurant margin for 2003 and 2002 are discussed in the respective sections

worldwide general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased 32 million or 3 in 2003 including a 1 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the unfavorable impact from both foreign currency translation and the ygr acquisition general and administrative expenses were flat year to date lower management incentive compensation costs were offset by increases in expenses associated with international restaurant expansion and pension expense

general and administrative expenses increased 117 million or 15 in 2002 excluding the unfavorable impact of the ygr acquisition general and administrative expenses increased 10 the increase was driven by higher compensationrelated costs and higher corporate and project spending

worldwide franchise and license expenses 

franchise and license expenses decreased 21 million or 42 in 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables primarily at taco bell

franchise and license expenses decreased 10 million or 18 in 2002 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables and the favorable impact of lapping support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain taco bell franchisees in 2001 the decrease was partially offset by higher marketing support costs in certain international markets

worldwide other income expense 

 the increase in other income expense in 2003 was primarily driven by the improved operating performance of our unconsolidated affiliates particularly in china

worldwide facility actions 

we recorded a net loss from facility actions of 36 million 32 million and 1 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively see the store portfolio strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and note 7 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment

worldwide interest expense net 

 interest expense increased 5 million or 3 in 2003 excluding the impact of the ygr acquisition interest expense decreased 6 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average debt outstanding

interest expense increased 8 million or 5 in 2002 excluding the impact of the ygr acquisition interest expense decreased 12 the decrease was driven by a reduction in our average debt balance partially offset by an increase in our average interest rate our average interest rate increased due to a reduction in our variablerate borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of longer term fixedrate notes

worldwide income taxes 

 the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below

 income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately 1 million on the 2 million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended december 27 2003 due to the adoption of sfas 143

the 2003 effective tax rate decreased 19 percentage points to 302 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a 41 percentage point benefit of amending certain prior us income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years the returns were amended upon our determination that it was more beneficial to claim credit for such taxes than to deduct such taxes as had been done when the returns were originally filed in future years we anticipate continuing to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in the then current year as we have done in 2003 and 2002 however the amended return benefit recognized in 2003 is nonrecurring

the decrease in the 2003 effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not the valuation allowances recognized primarily related to deferred tax assets in mexico and thailand see note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances

the 2002 effective tax rate decreased 07 percentage points to 321 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to our claiming credit against our current and future us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid in 2002 as opposed to deducting such taxes on our us income tax returns as was done in 2001 this decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping valuation allowance reversals recorded in 2001

in 2003 and 2002 the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of claiming credit against our current and future us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid

adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that we believe may impact our exposure

 27

 for 2003 blended company same store sales were flat due to a decrease in transactions offset by an increase in average guest check for 2002 blended company same store sales were up 2 due to increases in both transactions and average guest check

us company restaurant margin 

 restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 140 basis points in 2003 the decrease was primarily driven by increased occupancy expenses due to higher rent primarily due to additional rent expense associated with the amended ygr saleleaseback agreements and utilities the higher food and paper costs were primarily due to the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs primarily driven by low singledigit increases in wage rates

restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 80 basis points in 2002 the increase includes the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of sfas 142 which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 20 basis points from the ygr acquisition the increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of same store sales growth on margin and lower food and paper costs partially offset by an increase in labor costs the decrease in food and paper costs was primarily driven by cheese costs the increase in labor costs was primarily driven by wage rates

us operating profit 

operating profit increased 10 million or 1 in 2003 excluding the favorable impact of the ygr acquisition operating profit was flat compared to 2002 decreases driven by lower margins as a result of increased occupancy expenses and the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix shift on food and paper costs were offset by lower franchise and license and general and administrative expenses

international company restaurant margin 

 30

restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 50 basis points in 2003 including a 20 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation the remaining decrease was driven by the impact on margin of same store sales declines these decreases were partially offset by the impact of supply chain savings initiatives on the cost of food and paper principally in china and the cessation of depreciation expense of approximately 9 million for the puerto rico business which is held for sale

restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 210 basis points in 2002 including the favorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from the adoption of sfas 142 the increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lower restaurant operating costs and the elimination of lower average margin units through store closures lower restaurant operating costs primarily resulted from lower food and paper costs partially offset by higher labor costs

international operating profit 

operating profit increased 80 million or 22 in 2003 including a 7 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the remaining increase was driven by new unit development and the impact of supply chain savings initiatives on the cost of food and paper partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines on margins and higher general and administrative expenses

operating profit increased 56 million or 19 in 2002 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact from the adoption of sfas 142 operating profit increased 13 the increase was driven by new unit development and the favorable impact of lower restaurant operating costs primarily lower cost of food and paper the increase was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses primarily compensationrelated costs

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1053 million compared to 1088 million in 2002 the decrease was primarily driven by 130 million in voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan in 2003 partially offset by higher net income

in 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was 1088 million compared to 832 million in 2001 excluding the impact of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process cash provided by operating activities was 1043 million versus 704 million in 2001 the increase was driven by higher net income and timing of tax receipts and payments

net cash used in investing activities was 519 million versus 885 million in 2002 the decrease in cash used was driven by the 275 million acquisition of ygr in 2002 and lower capital spending in 2003

in 2002 net cash used in investing activities was 885 million versus 503 million in 2001 the increase in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of ygr and higher capital spending in 2002 partially offset by the acquisition of fewer restaurants from franchisees in 2002

net cash used in financing activities was 475 million versus 187 million in 2002 the increase was driven by higher net debt repayments and higher shares repurchased in 2003

in 2002 net cash used in financing activities was 187 million versus 352 million in 2001 the decrease is primarily due to lower debt repayments and higher proceeds from stock option exercises versus 2001 partially offset by higher shares repurchased in 2002

consolidated financial condition 

assets increased 220 million or 4 to 56 billion primarily due to a net increase in property plant and equipment driven by capital expenditures in excess of depreciation and asset dispositions the decrease in the allowance for

doubtful accounts from 42 million to 28 million was primarily the result of the writeoff of receivables previously fully reserved

liabilities decreased 306 million or 6 to 45 billion primarily due to the repayment of amounts under our credit facility decreased shortterm borrowings and the reduction in longterm debt as a result of the amendment of certain saleleaseback agreements see note 14 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily due to the accrual of 42 million related to the wrench litigation

liquidity and capital resources 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in each of the last two fiscal years net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded 1 billion these cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending while at the same time reducing our longterm debt balances we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and repurchases of shares of our common stock though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations we believe our operating cash flows our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2004 and beyond

our primary bank credit agreement comprises a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures on june 25 2005 on december 26 2003 we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the credit facility from 12 billion to 10 billion at december 27 2003 our unused credit facility totaled 737 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 263 million there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 27 2003 our credit facility contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness guarantees of indebtedness level of cash dividends aggregate nonus investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement we were in compliance with all covenants at december 27 2003 and do not anticipate that the covenants will impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility for its remaining term

the remainder of our longterm debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were 185 billion at december 27 2003 the first of these notes in the amount of 350 million matures in 2005 we currently anticipate that our net cash provided by operating activities will permit us to make a significant portion of this 350 million payment without borrowing additional amounts

we estimate that capital spending will be approximately 770 million and refranchising proceeds will be approximately 100 million in 2004 in november 2003 our board of directors authorized a new 300 million share repurchase program at december 27 2003 we had remaining capacity to repurchase through may 21 2005 up to 294 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under this program

in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 27 2003 included

    we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan’s funded status the pension plan’s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2004 but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plan’s expected september 30 2004 funded status during 2003 we made voluntary pension contributions of 130 million to our funded plan none of which represented minimum funding requirements our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance but is pay as you go we made postretirement benefit payments of 4 million in 2003

also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for employee health and property and casualty losses for which we are selfinsured the majority of our recorded liability for selfinsured employee health and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 27 2003 we had provided approximately 32 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools both of which were implemented prior to spinoff related primarily to the company’s historical refranchising programs and to a lesser extent franchisee development of new restaurants the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately 123 million at december 27 2003 in support of these guarantees we have posted 32 million of letters of credit we also provide a standby letter of credit of 23 million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities these provisions were primarily charged to facility actions new loans are not currently being added to either loan pool

we have guaranteed certain lines of credit and loans of unconsolidated affiliates totaling 28 million at december 27 2003 our unconsolidated affiliates had total revenues of over 15 billion for the year ended december 27 2003 and assets and debt of approximately 858 million and 41 million respectively at december 27 2003

other significant known events trends or uncertainties expected to impact 2004 operating profit comparisons with 2003 

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

see note 2

canada unconsolidated affiliate dissolution 

on november 10 2003 our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated 479 kfc 236 pizza hut and 18 taco bell restaurants in canada was dissolved we owned 50 of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method upon dissolution the company assumed operation and acquired all associated assets of the pizza huts as well as 17 taco bells and 5 kfcs the company also acquired the real estate associated with 140 kfcs for which the company will not be the operator our former partner in the unconsolidated affiliate acquired full ownership of all other assets as well as the franchise rights to operate 474 kfcs and one taco bell our former partner retained 10 kfcs and sold the remainder of these assets and franchise rights acquired to a newlyformed publiclyheld income trust in canada of which our former partner now holds a minority interest the company leases land and buildings for kfcs it does not operate to the income trust under operating and capital lease agreements through 2018 the company will continue to receive a franchise royalty from the kfcs operated by our former partner and the income trust

the company realized an immaterial gain upon dissolution of the unconsolidated affiliate this gain was realized as the fair value of our increased ownership in the assets received was greater than our carrying value in those assets and was net of expenses associated with the dissolution of the unconsolidated affiliate

the impact of the restructuring on our 2003 results of operations was not significant as a result of the restructuring 2004 company sales are expected to increase by approximately 165 million and franchise fees are expected to decrease by approximately 10 million the impact on net income is not expected to be material

amendment of saleleaseback agreements 

as discussed in note 14 and on page 18 of this mda in 2003 we amended two saleleaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of ygr we estimate the impact of these amendments in 2004 to be a decrease in restaurant profit of 8 million and a decrease in interest expense of 10 million

puerto rico business held for sale 

our puerto rican business has been held for sale since the fourth quarter of 2002 while a sale of the puerto rican business has not yet occurred we continue to believe that it is probable that a sale will occur during 2004 sales and restaurant profits of the puerto rican business were 187 million and 34 million in 2003

contingent lease guarantees 

under terms of our separation agreements at the time of the spinoff we indemnified pepsico for any losses incurred related to their guarantees of lease agreements of certain noncore businesses which were sold prior to the spinoff two of these businesses chevys mexican restaurant chevys and hot n now hnn filed for bankruptcy protection in october 2003 and january 2004 respectively while we cannot presently determine our liability under these indemnities

if any we do not expect the amount to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements any costs incurred will be charged to ameriserve and other charges credits see note 24 for further discussion

pension plan funded status 

certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after september 30 2001 are no longer eligible to participate as of our september 30 2003 measurement date these plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 629 million an accumulated benefit obligation “abo” of 563 million and a fair value of plan assets of 438 million as a result of the 125 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the abo at september 30 2003 we have recorded a 101 million charge to shareholders’ equity net of tax of 61 million as of december 27 2003

the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of 625 at september 30 2003 a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately 58 million at september 30 2003 conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately 60 million at september 30 2003

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is 85 we believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon given no change to the marketrelated value of our plan assets as of september 30 2003 a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our 2004 pension plan expense by approximately 4 million

the losses our plan assets have experienced along with the decrease in discount rates have largely contributed to the unrecognized actuarial loss of 230 million in our plans as of september 30 2003 for purposes of determining 2003 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 6 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2003 we will recognize approximately 19 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2004 given no change to the assumptions at our september 30 2003 measurement date actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2004 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline

in total we expect pension expense to increase approximately 14 million to 54 million in 2004 we have incorporated this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook the increase is driven by the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph and an increase in interest cost because of the higher pbo service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate though as previously mentioned the plans are closed to new participants a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 625 at september 30 2003 would impact our 2004 pension expense by approximately 11 million

we do not believe that the underfunded status of the pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in 2004 or future years given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five years we believe our cash flows from operating activities of approximately 1 billion per year are sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the plans and anticipated fundings have been incorporated into our cash flow projections we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook

avian flu 

in several asian markets including thailand taiwan south korea japan indonesia malaysia singapore and certain sections of china avian flu has impacted retail sales trends and sales trends at kfc through the date of this form 10k based on information as of the date of this form 10k the company believes that the most likely effect of avian flu

outbreaks in these markets some of which are completely franchised markets will be short term additionally the company currently does not expect that the avian flu outbreak will materially affect its chicken supply in asia or other markets

our most significant market that has been affected by the avian flu is china as we have previously stated if the avian flu outbreak were to affect the entire country of china for up to two months through the end of march 2004 with sales declines in the range of 20 at kfc 2004 diluted eps results for the company would be unfavorably impacted by up to 002 we have incorporated this potential unfavorable impact in our operating plans and outlook

ameriserve and other charges credits 

during 2004 we expect to recover approximately 10 million related to recoveries from the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process we expect that this will substantially complete our recoveries related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process see note 7 for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits

critical accounting policies 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgements could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semiannual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant our semiannual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses these impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant which can be for a period of over 20 years and any terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants

if the longlived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows we write the assets down to their fair value this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows including terminal value of the restaurant at an appropriate rate the discount rate used is our cost of capital adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist

when it is probable that we will sell a restaurant we write down the restaurant to its fair value we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform impairment evaluations at the group level fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of longlived assets

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary in addition we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows

before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates is generally significantly in excess of their carrying value

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting units over twenty years plus an expected terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit

for 2003 there was no impairment of goodwill identified during our annual impairment testing for our reporting units with goodwill the fair value is generally significantly in excess of the recorded carrying value thus we do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current business performance for 2002 we impaired 5 million of goodwill related to the pizza hut france reporting unit

our impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of values assigned to trademarksbrands of which we have acquired ownership or the right to a perpetual royaltyfree license in the case of aw we believe the value of these trademarksbrands is derived from the royalty we avoid in the case of company stores or receive in the case of franchise stores due to our ownership of or royaltyfree license of the trademarksbrands thus anticipated sales are the most important assumption in valuing trademarksbrands we limit assumptions about sales growth as well as other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based on our plans for the applicable concept

the most significant recorded trademarkbrand assets resulted when we acquired ygr in 2002 upon this acquisition 140 million and 72 million were allocated to the ljs and aw trademarksbrands respectively the results generated to date from the ygr acquisition on an overall basis have met our expectations we also now believe opportunities exist beyond those assumed in justification of our acquisition price with regard to increased penetration of ljs for both standalone units and as a multibrand partner accordingly we now believe our system’s development capital at least through the term of our current projections will be primarily directed towards ljs

the decision to focus shortterm development on increased penetration of ljs and discretionary capital spending limits have resulted in less than originally planned development of aw in the near term additionally while we continue to view aw as a viable multibrand partner subsequent to acquisition we decided to close or refranchise all companyowned aw restaurants that we had acquired these restaurants were lowvolume mallbased units that were inconsistent with the remainder of our companyowned portfolio we incorporated these plans into our fair value estimates of the ljs and aw trademarksbrands in 2003 as sales projections for ljs were in excess of those originally assumed when valuing the ljs trademarkbrand the trademarkbrand’s current fair value is in excess of its carrying value both the decision to close the companyowned aw units and the decision to focus on shortterm development opportunities at ljs negatively impacted the fair value of the aw trademarkbrand accordingly we recorded a charge of 5 million in 2003 to write the value of aw trademarkbrand down to its fair value

while we believe the sales assumptions used in our determination of the fair value of the aw trademarkbrand are reasonable and consistent with our operating plans and forecasts fluctuations in the assumptions would have impacted our impairment calculation if the longterm rate of sales growth used in our determination of the fair value of the aw trademarkbrand would have been one percentage point higher the trademarkbrand would not have been impaired alternatively if the longterm rate of sales growth would have been one percentage point lower additional impairment of approximately 4 million would have been recognized

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets

allowances for franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities 

we reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon predefined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due as a result of reserving using this methodology we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december 27 2003 see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations

primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable at december 27 2003 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable the potential total exposure under such leases is significant with 326 million representing the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 27 2003 discounted at our pretax cost of debt current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and historically we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts see note 24 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty claims the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate

see note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs

income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves 

at december 27 2003 we have a valuation allowance of 183 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of 231 million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures

see note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use

interest rate risk 

we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt

at december 27 2003 and december 28 2002 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately 3 million and 6 million respectively in annual income before income taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 27 2003 and december 28 2002 would decrease approximately 5 million and 8 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 27 2003 and december 28 2002 would decrease approximately 87 million and 93 million respectively fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

international operating profit constitutes approximately 36 of our operating profit in 2003 excluding unallocated and corporate expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 13 billion as of december 27 2003 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific the americas and europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 27 2003 operating profit would have decreased 49 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical and holding cash in local currencies when possible in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as on a limited basis commodity

future and option contracts commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december 27 2003 and december 28 2002 did not significantly impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows

yum is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on number of system units with nearly 33000 units in over 100 countries and territories the yum organization is currently made up of six operating companies organized around five restaurant concepts including its three original concepts kfc pizza hut and taco bell and two acquired concepts ljs and aw the “concepts” the six operating companies are kfc pizza hut taco bell ljs aw and yri

restaurant concepts 

through its five concepts the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items these restaurants are operated by the company or under the terms of franchise or license agreements by franchisees or licensees who are independent third parties or by affiliates in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest “unconsolidated affiliates”

in each concept consumers can dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell kfc ljs and aw offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality and the company is selective in granting franchises under the standard franchise agreement franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to yum purchasing or leasing the land and building and purchasing equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business including new products equipment and management techniques

the company is actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding where two or more of its concepts are operated in a single unit in addition the company is testing multibranding options involving one of its concepts and a restaurant concept not owned by or affiliated with yum by combining two or more restaurant concepts particularly those that have complementary daypart strengths in one location the company believes it can generate higher sales volumes from such units significantly improve returns on per unit investment and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater number of trade areas throughout the us and internationally through the consolidation of market planning initiatives across all of its concepts the company has established or is in the process of establishing in the case of ljs and aw multiyear development plans by trade area to optimize franchise and company penetration of its concepts and to improve returns on its existing asset base the development of multibranded units may be limited in some instances by prior development andor territory rights granted to franchisees

at yearend 2002 there were 1975 multibranded units in the worldwide system these units were comprised of 1918 units offering food products from two of the concepts a “2n1” 51 units offering food products from three of the concepts a “3n1” and 6 units offering food products from one of the concepts and a restaurant concept not owned by or affiliated with yum

restaurant operations 

through its concepts yum develops operates franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like malls airports gasoline service stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient

the company’s restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager “rgm” together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant usually has between 10 and 35 hourly employees most of whom work parttime the company’s six operating companies each issue detailed manuals covering all aspects of their respective operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards champs – which stands for cleanliness hospitality accuracy maintenance product quality and speed of service – is our core systemwide program for training measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures champs is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one set of standards rgms’ efforts including champs performance measures are monitored by area managers or market coaches market coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants the company’s restaurants are visited from time to time by various senior operators to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members

rgms attend and complete their respective operating company’s required training programs these programs consist of initial training as well as additional continuing development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to time initial manager training programs generally last at least six weeks and emphasize leadership business management supervisory skills including training coaching and recruiting product preparation and production safety quality control customer service labor management and equipment maintenance

we have provided for the estimated costs of the bravo litigation based on a projection of eligible claims including claims filed to date where applicable the amount of each eligible claim the estimated legal fees incurred by the plaintiffs and the results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters although the outcome of this case cannot be determined at this time we believe the ultimate cost of this case in excess of amounts already provided will not be material to our annual results of operations financial condition or cash flows any provisions have been recorded as unusual items

other litigation 

on january 16 1998 a lawsuit against taco bell corp entitled wrench llc joseph shields and thomas rinks v taco bell corp “wrench” was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan the lawsuit alleges that taco bell corp misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising featuring a chihuahua plaintiffs seek to recover damages under several theories including breach of impliedinfact contract idea misappropriation conversion and unfair competition on june 10 1999 the district court granted summary judgment in favor of taco bell corp plaintiffs filed an appeal with the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit the “court of appeals” and oral arguments were held on september 20 2000 on july 6 2001 the court of appeals reversed the district court’s judgment in favor of taco bell and remanded the case to the district court taco bell corp unsuccessfully petitioned the court of appeals for rehearing en banc and its petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied on january 21 2002 the case has now officially been returned to the district court where the wrench plaintiffs will be allowed to bring their claims to trial it is expected that the trial will commence in may 2003

we believe that the wrench plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and are vigorously defending the case however in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time likewise the amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

on may 16 2002 tricon global restaurants inc changed its name to yum brands inc in order to better reflect our expanding portfolio of brands in addition on the same day tricon restaurants international changed its name to yum restaurants international

yum brands inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as “yum” or the “company” comprises the worldwide operations of kfc pizza hut taco bell long john silver’s “ljs” and aw allamerican food restaurants “aw” collectively “the concepts” and is the world’s largest quick service restaurant “qsr” company based on the number of system units ljs and aw were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants inc “ygr” on may 7 2002 separately kfc pizza hut and taco bell rank in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units with 11798 international units yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us yum became an independent publicly owned company on october 6 1997 the “spinoff date” via a taxfree distribution of our common stock the “distribution” or “spinoff” to the shareholders of our former parent pepsico inc “pepsico”

throughout management’s discussion and analysis “mda” we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net loss gain and unusual items income expense see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

all references to per share and share amounts in the following mda have been adjusted to reflect the twoforone stock split distributed on june 17 2002

in 2002 our international business yum restaurants international “yri” or “international” accounted for 35 of system sales 31 of revenues and 32 of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses we anticipate that despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations we will continue to invest in certain international markets with substantial growth potential

this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages 41 through 79 and the cautionary statements on pages 39 and 40 all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 46 through 79 tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified

critical accounting policies 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition changes in the estimates and judgements could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows

impairment or disposal of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semiannual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant our semiannual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses these impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant which can be for a period of over 20 years and any terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants

if the longlived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows we write the assets down to their fair value this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows including terminal value of the restaurant at an appropriate rate the discount rate used is our cost of capital adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist

when it is probable that we will sell a restaurant we write down the restaurant to its fair value we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform impairment evaluations at the group level fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of longlived assets

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary in addition we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates

impairment of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting units over twenty years plus an expected terminal value we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit

we impaired 5 million of goodwill during 2002 related to our pizza hut france reporting unit for the remainder of our reporting units with goodwill the fair value is generally significantly in excess of the recorded carrying value thus we do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current business performance

see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill

allowances for franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities 

we reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon predefined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due as a result of reserving using this methodology we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december 28 2002 see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations

primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable at december 28 2002 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable the potential total exposure under such leases is significant with 278 million representing the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december 28 2002 discounted at our pretax cost of debt current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases we generally have crossdefault provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease we believe these crossdefault provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and historically we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts see note 24 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees

selfinsured property and casualty losses 

we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred selfinsured property and casualty claims the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment benefit levels medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall selfinsurance costs additionally a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate

see note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs

income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves 

at december 28 2002 we have recorded a valuation allowance of 137 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of 176 million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies thus recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position we evaluate these reserves including interest thereon on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures

see note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes

factors affecting comparability of 2002 results to 2001 results and 2001 results to 2000 results 

ygr acquisition 

on may 7 2002 the company completed its acquisition of ygr the parent company of ljs and aw see note 4 for a discussion of the acquisition

as of the date of the acquisition ygr consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise ljs units respectively and 127 and 742 company and franchise aw units respectively in addition 133 multibranded ljsaw restaurants were included in the ljs unit totals except as discussed in certain sections of the mda the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in 2002 was not significant

impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

effective december 30 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” in its entirety in accordance with the requirements of sfas 142 we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles as of december 30 2001 the following table summarizes the favorable effect of sfas 142 on restaurant profit restaurant margin and ongoing operating profit had sfas 142 been effective in 2001

 additionally if sfas 142 had been effective in 2001 reported net income would have increased approximately 26 million and diluted earnings per common share “eps” would have increased 009

unusual items income expense 

we recorded unusual items income of 27 million in 2002 and 3 million in 2001 and unusual items expense of 204 million in 2000 see note 7 for a detailed discussion of our unusual items income expense

impact of new unconsolidated affiliates 

consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets we formed ventures in canada and poland with our largest franchisee in each market the venture in canada was formed in the third quarter of 2000 and the venture in poland was effective in the first quarter of 2001 at the date of formation the canadian venture operated over 700 stores and the poland venture operated approximately 100 stores we did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures

previously the results from the restaurants we contributed to these ventures were consolidated the impact of these transactions on operating results is similar to the impact of our refranchising activities which is described in the store portfolio strategy section below consequently these transactions resulted in a decline in our company sales restaurant margin dollars and general and administrative “ga” expenses as well as higher franchise fees we also record equity income loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates “equity income” and in canada higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture the formation of these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in 2001

store portfolio strategy 

since 1995 we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve the restaurants’ overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets this portfoliobalancing activity reduces our reported revenues and restaurant profits which increases the importance of system sales as a key performance measure we substantially completed our us refranchising program in 2001

the following table summarizes our refranchising activities

  in addition to our refranchising program we have closed certain restaurants over the past several years restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants restaurants relocated to a new site within the same trade area or us pizza hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dinein traditional store within the same trade area

the following table summarizes company store closure activities

 the impact on ongoing operating profit arising from our refranchising and store closure initiatives as well as the contribution of company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates is the net of a the estimated reduction in company sales restaurant profit and ga expenses b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised and c the estimated change in equity income loss the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year

the following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising company store closures and in 2001 the contribution of company stores to unconsolidated affiliates

  the following table summarizes the estimated impact on ongoing operating profit of refranchising company store closures and in 2001 the contribution of company stores to unconsolidated affiliates

  franchisee financial condition 

like others in the qsr industry from time to time some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations

depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation and in the absence of an improvement in the franchisee’s business trends there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues these include a sale of some or all of the operator’s restaurants to us or a third party a restructuring of the operator’s business andor finances or in the more unusual cases bankruptcy of the operator it is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues

since 2000 certain of our franchise operators principally in the taco bell system have experienced varying degrees of financial problems through december 28 2002 restructurings have been completed for approximately 1778 taco bell franchise restaurants in connection with these restructurings taco bell has acquired 147 restaurants for approximately 76 million in addition to these acquisitions taco bell has purchased land buildings andor equipment related to 52

22 restaurants from franchisees for approximately 28 million and simultaneously leased it back to these franchisees under longterm leases as part of the restructurings taco bell committed to fund approximately 45 million of future franchise capital expenditures principally through leasing arrangements approximately 26 million of which has been funded through december 28 2002 we substantially completed the taco bell franchisee restructurings in 2002 and expect to finalize any remaining restructurings in the first quarter of 2003

in the fourth quarter of 2000 taco bell also established a 15 million loan program to assist certain franchisees all fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of 2001 a remaining net balance of 7 million at december 28 2002 for these notes receivable is included primarily in other assets

we believe that the general improvement in business trends at taco bell has helped alleviate financial problems in the taco bell franchise system which were due to past downturns in sales as described in the us revenues section company samestore sales growth at taco bell increased 7 in 2002 this follows an 8 increase in company samestore sales growth at taco bell in the fourth quarter of 2001 generally franchisees have experienced similar or better growth over these time frames accordingly the cost of restructurings of taco bell franchise restaurants was less in 2002 than in 2001 and though we continue to monitor this situation we expect these costs to be less again in 2003

in 2002 and 2001 the company charged expenses of 8 million and 18 million respectively to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful taco bell franchise and license fee receivables these costs are reported as part of franchise and license expenses on an ongoing basis we assess our exposure from franchiserelated risks which include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables contingent lease liabilities guarantees to support third party financial arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees the contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the lease guarantees section of note 24 although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure as of december 28 2002 it is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs however these costs are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results of operations financial condition or cash flows

impact of ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 

see note 25 for a discussion of the impact of the ameriserve food distribution inc “ameriserve” bankruptcy reorganization process on the company

impact of the consolidation of an unconsolidated affiliate 

at the beginning of 2001 we consolidated a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate as a result of this change company sales restaurant margin and ga increased approximately 100 million 6 million and 9 million respectively in 2001 also as a result of the change franchise fees and equity income decreased approximately 4 million and 2 million respectively in 2001 at the date of consolidation this previously unconsolidated affiliate operated over 100 stores

fiftythird week in 2000 

our fiscal calendar results in a fiftythird week every 5 or 6 years fiscal year 2000 included a fiftythird week in the fourth quarter the estimated favorable impact in net income was 10 million or 003 per diluted share in 2000 the following table summarizes the estimated favorableunfavorable impact of the fiftythird week on system sales revenues and ongoing operating profit in 2000

   worldwide system sales 

system sales represents the combined sales of company unconsolidated affiliates franchise and license restaurants sales of unconsolidated affiliates and franchise and license restaurants result in franchise and license fees for us but are not included in the company sales figure we present on the consolidated statements of income however we believe that system sales is useful to investors as a significant indicator of our concepts’ market share and the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development

worldwide company restaurant margin 

 restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 120 basis points in 2002 the increase included the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of sfas 142 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 15 basis points from the ygr acquisition us restaurant margin increased approximately 80 basis points and international restaurant margin increased approximately 210 basis points

worldwide general and administrative expenses 

ga expenses increased 117 million or 15 in 2002 excluding the unfavorable impact of the ygr acquisition ga expenses increased 10 the increase was primarily driven by higher compensationrelated costs and higher corporate and project spending

ga expenses decreased 34 million or 4 in 2001 excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fiftythird week in 2000 ga expenses decreased 3 the decrease was driven by lower corporate and project spending the formation of unconsolidated affiliates and refranchising the decrease was partially offset by higher compensationrelated costs

worldwide franchise and license expenses 

franchise and license expenses decreased 10 million or 18 in 2002 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables and the favorable impact of lapping support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain taco bell franchisees in 2001 the decrease was partially offset by higher marketing support costs in certain international markets

franchise and license expenses increased 10 million or 20 in 2001 the increase was primarily due to support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain taco bell franchisees the increase was partially offset by lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables

unallocated and corporate expenses decreased 15 million or 9 in 2001 excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fiftythird week in 2000 ga decreased 8 the decline was primarily due to lower corporate and project spending partially offset by higher compensationrelated costs

worldwide interest expense net 

 net interest expense increased 14 million or 8 in 2002 interest expense increased 8 million or 5 in 2002 excluding the impact of the ygr acquisition interest expense decreased 12 the decrease was driven by a reduction in our average debt balance partially offset by an increase in our average interest rate our average interest rate increased due to a reduction in our variablerate borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of longer term fixedrate notes

net interest expense decreased 18 million or 10 in 2001 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average interest rate

worldwide income taxes 

  the following table reconciles the us federal statutory tax rate to our ongoing effective tax rate

 the 2002 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 18 percentage points to 313 the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to prior years and an increase in the benefit from claiming credit against our current and future us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid partially offset by reduced valuation allowance reversals see note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances

in 2002 the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of claiming credit against our current and future us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid

the 2001 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 46 percentage points to 331 the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to prior years partially offset by reduced valuation allowance reversals

in 2001 the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was slightly higher than the us federal statutory rate because losses of foreign operations for which no benefit could be currently recognized and other adjustments more than offset the effect of claiming credit against our us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1088 million compared to 832 million in 2001 excluding the impact of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process cash provided by operating activities was 1043 million versus 704 million in 2001 this increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit and timing of tax receipts and payments

in 2001 net cash provided by operating activities was 832 million compared to 491 million in 2000 excluding the impact of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process cash provided by operating activities was 704 million versus 734 million in 2000

net cash used in investing activities was 885 million versus 503 million in 2001 the increase in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of ygr and higher capital spending in 2002 partially offset by the acquisition of fewer restaurants from franchisees in 2002

in 2001 net cash used in investing activities was 503 million versus 237 million in 2000 the increase in cash used was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants in 2001 and increased acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending the increase was partially offset by lapping the funding of a debtorinpossession revolving credit facility to ameriserve in 2000

although we report gross proceeds in our consolidated statements of cash flows we also consider refranchising proceeds on an “aftertax” basis we define aftertax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities primarily accounts payable and property taxes related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains the aftertax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares aftertax proceeds were approximately 71 million in 2002 which reflects a 21 decrease from 2001 this decrease was due to the refranchising of fewer restaurants in 2002 versus 2001

net cash used in financing activities was 187 million versus 352 million in 2001 the decrease is primarily due to lower debt repayments and higher proceeds from stock option exercises versus 2001 partially offset by higher shares repurchased in 2002

in 2001 net cash used in financing activities was 352 million compared to 207 million in 2000 the increase in cash used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in 2001 compared to 2000

in november 2002 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program this program authorizes us to repurchase through november 20 2004 up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees during 2002 we repurchased approximately 12 million shares for approximately 28 million under this program

in february 2001 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program this program authorized us to repurchase up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees this share repurchase program was completed in 2002 during 2002 we repurchased approximately 70 million shares for approximately 200 million under this program during 2001 we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for approximately 100 million

in september 1999 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program this program authorized us to repurchase up to 350 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees this share repurchase program was completed in 2000 during 2000 we repurchased approximately 128 million shares for approximately 216 million

see note 21 for a discussion of the share repurchase programs

financing activities 

on june 25 2002 we closed on a new 14 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “new credit facility” the new credit facility replaced the existing bank credit agreement which was comprised of a senior unsecured term loan facility and a 175 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively referred to as the “old credit facilities” that were scheduled to mature on october 2 2002 on december 27 2002 we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the new credit facility from 14 billion to 12 billion the new credit facility matures on june 25 2005 we used the initial borrowings under the new credit facility to repay the indebtedness under the old credit facilities

the new credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains other terms and provisions including representations warranties covenants conditions and events of default similar to those set forth in the old credit facilities specifically the new credit facility contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the new credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including among other things limitations on certain additional indebtedness guarantees of indebtedness cash dividends aggregate nonus investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement

under the terms of the new credit facility we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit at december 28 2002 our unused new credit facility totaled 09 billion net of outstanding letters of credit of 02 billion the interest rate for borrowings under the new credit facility ranges from 100 to 200 over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or 000 to 065 over an alternate base rate which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 1 the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate as applicable will depend upon our performance under specified financial criteria interest is payable at least quarterly in the third quarter of 2002 we capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately 9 million related to the new credit facility these debt issuance costs will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the new credit facility

in june 2002 we issued 400 million of 770 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2012 the “2012 notes” the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2012 notes were used to repay indebtedness under the new credit facility interest on the 2012 notes is payable january 1 and july 1 of each year and commenced on january 1 2003 we capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately 5 million related to the 2012 notes in third quarter of 2002 subsequent to this issuance we have 150 million available for issuance under a 2 billion shelf registration filed in 1997

as discussed in note 4 upon the acquisition of ygr we assumed approximately 168 million in present value of future rent obligations related to certain saleleaseback agreements entered into by ygr involving approximately 350 ljs units as a result of liens held by the buyerlessor on certain personal property within the units the saleleaseback agreements have been accounted for as financings and are reflected as debt in our consolidated financial statements as of december 28 2002 rental payments made under these agreements will be made on a monthly basis through 2019 with an effective interest rate of approximately 11

consolidated financial condition 

assets increased 975 million or 22 to 54 billion this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of ygr and the impact of capital spending the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from 77 million to 42 million was primarily the result of recoveries related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process see note 25 and the writeoff of receivables previously fully reserved the increase in assets classified as held for sale is due primarily to classification of our puerto rico market as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2002

liabilities increased 485 million or 11 to 48 billion the increase was primarily due to additional financing associated with the acquisition of ygr as discussed in note 14 the decrease in shortterm borrowings of 550 million and the increase in longterm debt of 747 million are primarily the result of the replacement of our old credit facilities that were to expire in october 2002 with the new credit facility that will expire in 2005 the increase in current income taxes payable was primarily the result of a reclassification from other liabilities and deferred credits for taxes that are now expected to be paid within the next twelve months

liquidity 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations which require a limited yum investment in operating assets typically our cash flows include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations we believe our operating cash flows and ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2003 and beyond

significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 28 2002 due by period included

   see note 14 for a discussion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt and note 15 for a discussion of leases

pension plan funded status 

certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans the most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after september 30 2001 are no longer eligible to participate as of our september 30 2002 measurement date these plans had a projected benefit obligation “pbo” of 501 million an accumulated benefit obligation “abo” of 448 million and a fair value of plan assets of 251 million subsequent to the measurement date but prior to december 28 2002 we made an additional 25 million contribution to the plans which is not included in this fair value of plan assets as a result of the 250 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the pbo at september 30 2002 we have recorded a 71 million charge to shareholders’ equity net of tax of 43 million as of december 28 2002

the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of 685 at september 30 2002 a 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately 49 million at september 30 2002 conversely a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately 56 million at september 30 2002

due to recent stock market declines our pension plan assets have experienced losses in value in 2002 and 2001 totaling approximately 75 million we changed our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 10 to 85 for the determination of our 2002 expense we believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon this change resulted in the recognition of approximately 5 million in incremental expense in comparison to 2001 we will continue to use the 85 expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in 2003 given no change to the marketrelated value of our plan assets as of september 30 2002 a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase respectively our pension plan expense by approximately 3 million

the losses our plan assets have experienced along with the decrease in discount rates have largely contributed to the unrecognized actuarial loss of 169 million in our plans as of september 30 2002 for purposes of determining 2002 expense our funded status was such that we recognized 1 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2002 we will recognize approximately 7 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2003 given no change to the assumptions at our september 30 2002 measurement date actuarial loss recognition will increase gradually over the next few years however we do not believe the increase will materially impact our results of operations

in total we expect pension expense to increase approximately 14 million to 41 million in 2003 we have incorporated this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook the increase is driven by an increase in interest cost because of the higher pbo and the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate though as previously mentioned the plans are closed to new participants a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 685 at september 30 2002 would impact our pension expense by approximately 11 million

we do not believe that the underfunded status of the pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in 2003 or future years given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five years we believe that our cash flows from operating activities of approximately 1 billion per year are sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the plans and anticipated fundings have been incorporated into our cash flow projections we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use

interest rate risk 

we have a significant market risk exposure to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt

at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result in a reduction of 6 million and 4 million respectively in annual income before taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt in addition the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 would decrease approximately 8 million and 5 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 would decrease approximately 93 million and 72 million respectively fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

international ongoing operating profit constitutes approximately 32 of our ongoing operating profit in 2002 excluding unallocated and corporate expenses in addition the company’s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 1 billion as of december 28 2002 operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company’s primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific the americas and europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december 28 2002 operating profit would have decreased 43 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10 relative to the us dollar the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as on a limited basis commodity future and option contracts commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 did not significantly impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows

restaurant concepts 

through its three widelyrecognized concepts the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items these restaurants are operated by the company or under the terms of franchise or license agreements by franchisees or licensees who are independent third parties or by international affiliates in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest unconsolidated affiliates 

in each concept consumers can dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

tricon global restaurants inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as tricon or the company is comprised of the worldwide operations of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the concepts and is the worlds largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units separately each brand ranks in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units our 10927 international units make us the second largest qsr company outside the us tricon became an independent publicly owned company on october 6 1997 the spinoff date via a taxfree distribution of our common stock the distribution or spinoff to the shareholders of our former parent pepsico inc pepsico 

tricon has numerous registered trademarks and service marks we believe that many of these marks including our kentucky fried chicken® kfc® pizza hut® and taco bell® trademarks have significant value and are materially important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of important trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks from time to time we may become involved in litigation to defend and protect our use of such registered marks the use of our trademarks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in kfc pizza hut and taco bell franchise and license agreements under current law and with proper use our rights in trademarks can generally last indefinitely we also have certain patents on restaurant equipment which while valuable are not material to our business 

throughout managements discussion and analysis mda we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net loss gain unusual items income expense and our accounting and human resources policy changes in 1999 the 1999 accounting changes see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to forecast future performance ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the us and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 

in 2001 our international business tricon restaurants international tri or international accounted for 35 of system sales 31 of revenues and 31 of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss we anticipate that despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential 

this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages 37 through 73 and the cautionary statements on page 36 all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 42 through 73 tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified 

critical accounting policies 

our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that required us to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve estimations about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations financial condition or cash flows changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future years we believe that our most significant policies require 

estimation of cash flows associated with the disposition of restaurants and the impairment of longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates see note 2 for a further discussion determination of the appropriate allowances and reserves associated with franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities see note 2 for a discussion of the allowance for uncollectible franchise and license receivables and note 22 for a discussion of franchise contingent liabilities estimation using actuariallydetermined methods of our selfinsured losses under our property and casualty loss programs see note 22 for a discussion of our insurance programs determination of the appropriate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and reserves for potential tax exposures see note 20 for a discussion of income taxes factors affecting comparability of 2001 results to 2000 results 

impact of ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 

see note 22 for a discussion of the impact of the ameriserve food distribution inc ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process on the company 

franchisee financial condition 

like others in the qsr industry from time to time some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations during 2001 and 2000 certain of our franchise operators principally in the taco bell system experienced varying degrees of financial problems 

depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation and in the absence of an improvement in the franchisees business trends there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues these include a sale of some or all of the operators restaurants to us or a third party a restructuring of the operators business andor finances or in the more unusual cases bankruptcy of the operator it is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues 

through february 11 2002 restructurings have been completed for approximately 1000 taco bell franchise restaurants in connection with these restructurings taco bell has acquired 123 restaurants for approximately 65 million through december 29 2001 in addition to these acquisitions taco bell purchased 19 restaurants from franchisees for approximately 12 million and simultaneously leased the restaurants back to these franchisees under longterm leases as part of the restructurings taco bell has committed to fund approximately 29 million of future franchise capital expenditures principally through leasing arrangements in the fourth quarter of 2000 taco bell established a 15 million loan program to assist certain franchisees all fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of 2001 and the resulting notes receivable are primarily included in other assets 

we believe that the recent improvement in business trends at taco bell has helped alleviate financial problems in the taco bell franchise system which were due to past downturns in sales accordingly though we continue to monitor this situation we expect restructurings of the remaining taco bell franchise restaurants with financial issues to be significantly less in number and costs in 2002 

in 2001 and 2000 the company charged expenses of 18 million and 26 million respectively to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables these costs are reported as franchise and license expenses on an ongoing basis we assess our exposure from franchiserelated risks which include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables contingent lease liabilities guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees the contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the contingent liabilities section of note 22 although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure as of december 29 2001 it is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs however these cost are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

unusual items income expense 

we recorded unusual items income of 3 million in 2001 and unusual items expense of 204 million in 2000 and 51 million in 1999 see note 5 for a detailed discussion of our unusual items income expense 

in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded expenses of approximately 4 million related to streamlining certain support functions which included the termination of approximately 90 employees the reserves established which primarily related to severance were almost fully utilized in the first quarter of 2002 we expect to incur additional costs of approximately 2 million in 2002 related to these actions which will be expensed as incurred beginning in 2002 we anticipate savings in general and administrative expenses ga of approximately 6 million per year primarily related to reduced compensation however we expect to reinvest a substantial portion of these savings in our growth initiatives including multibranding 

impact of new unconsolidated affiliates 

consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets we formed new ventures in canada and poland with our largest franchisee in each market the venture in canada was formed in the third quarter of 2000 and the venture in poland was effective in the first quarter of 2001 the canadian venture operates over 700 stores and the poland venture operates approximately 100 stores we did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures 

previously the results from the restaurants we contributed to these ventures were consolidated the impact of these transactions on operating results is similar to the impact of our refranchising activities which is described in the store portfolio strategy section below consequently these transactions resulted in a decline in our company sales restaurant margin dollars and ga as well as higher franchise fees we also record equity income losses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates equity income and in canada higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture the formation of these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in 2001 

impact of the consolidation of an unconsolidated affiliate 

at the beginning of 2001 we consolidated a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate this change resulted in higher company sales restaurant margin dollars and ga as well as decreased franchise fees and equity income this previously unconsolidated affiliate operates over 100 stores 

fiftythird week in 2000 

our fiscal calendar results in a fiftythird week every 5 or 6 years fiscal year 2000 included a fiftythird week in the fourth quarter the estimated favorable impact in net income was 10 million or 007 per diluted share in 2000 the following table summarizes the estimated favorableunfavorable impact of the fiftythird week on system sales revenues and ongoing operating profit

since 1995 we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets this portfoliobalancing activity has reduced our reported revenues and restaurant profits and has increased the importance of system sales as a key performance measure we substantially completed our refranchising program in 2001 

the following table summarizes our refranchising activities

worldwide general and administrative expenses 

ga decreased 34 million or 4 in 2001 excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fiftythird week in 2000 ga decreased 3 the decrease was driven by lower corporate and project spending the formation of unconsolidated affiliates and refranchising the decrease was partially offset by higher compensation costs 

ga decreased 65 million or 7 in 2000 excluding the unfavorable impact from lapping the 1999 accounting changes ga decreased 9 the decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and year 2000 costs as well as the favorable impact of refranchising and store closures reduced spending on conferences also contributed to the decline ga included year 2000 spending of approximately 2 million in 2000 as compared to approximately 30 million in 1999

in 2001 the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was slightly higher than the us federal statutory rate because losses of foreign operations for which no benefit could be currently recognized and other adjustments more than offset the effect of claiming credit against our us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid 

the 2000 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 16 percentage points to 377 the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the tax on our international operations including the initial benefits of becoming eligible in 2000 to claim substantially all of our available foreign income tax credits for foreign taxes paid in 2000 against our us income tax liability and incremental valuation allowance reversals this decrease was partially offset by adjustments relating to prior years 

in 2000 the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the us federal statutory rate due to our ability to claim credit against our us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations in 1999 was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate this was primarily due to foreign tax rate differentials including foreign withholding tax paid without benefit of the related foreign tax credit for us income tax purposes and losses of foreign operations for which no tax benefit could be currently recognized

restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 55 basis points in 2000 including a decline of approximately 25 basis points resulting from lapping the 1999 accounting changes the remaining decrease primarily resulted from a shift to lower margin chicken sandwiches at kfc volume declines at taco bell and the absence of favorable 1999 insurancerelated adjustments the decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of refranchising and pricing and product mix favorable product costs primarily cheese were almost fully offset by higher occupancy and other costs and higher wage rates

ongoing operating profit decreased 20 million or 3 in 2001 excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fiftythird week in 2000 ongoing operating profit decreased 1 the decrease was driven by the unfavorable impact of refranchising and store closures higher restaurant operating costs and higher franchise support costs related to the restructuring of certain taco bell franchisees the decrease was partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix and new unit development

consolidated cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 341 million to 832 million the increase was primarily due to the collection of receivables established in 2000 and the absence of the unusual charges taken in 2000 related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process excluding the ameriserverelated items cash provided by operating activities was 704 million versus 734 million in 2000 see note 22 for a discussion of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 

in 2000 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 74 million to 491 million the decrease was primarily due to unusual charges related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process and the related use of working capital the primary driver of the net use of working capital was an increase in receivables arising from the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process which resulted in a net use of working capital of approximately 135 million excluding these ameriserverelated items cash from operating activities increased by 143 million to 734 million this increase was driven by a lower reduction of our working capital deficit than in 1999 

our working capital deficit excluding cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm borrowings is typical of restaurant operations where a majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers carry longer payment terms generally from 1030 days the lower working capital deficit reduction in 2000 is the result of refranchising significantly fewer restaurants in 2000 versus 1999 partially offset by a change in payment terms in our food and supply distribution agreement from 30 to 15 days 

net cash used in investing activities was 503 million versus 237 million in 2000 the increase in cash used was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants in 2001 and increased acquisition and capital spending the increase was partially offset by lapping the funding of a debtorinpossession revolving credit facility to ameriserve in 2000 

in 2000 net cash used in investing activities was 237 million versus net cash provided of 522 million in 1999 the decline in cash flow from investing activities was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants to franchisees in 2000 versus 1999 increased capital spending related to development and funding of a debtorinpossession revolving credit facility to ameriserve 

although we report gross proceeds in our consolidated statements of cash flows we also consider refranchising proceeds on an aftertax basis we define aftertax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities primarily accounts payable and property taxes related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains the aftertax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares aftertax proceeds were approximately 90 million in 2001 which reflects a 65 decrease from 2000 this decrease was due to the refranchising of fewer restaurants in 2001 versus 2000 aftertax proceeds were approximately 261 million in 2000 a 62 decrease versus 1999 this decrease was also due to refranchising fewer restaurants in 2000 than 1999 

net cash used in financing activities was 352 million compared to 207 million in 2000 the increase in cash used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in 2001 compared to 2000 

in 2000 net cash used in financing activities decreased to 207 million versus 11 billion in 1999 due to lower debt repayments less cash was available for financing activities in 2000 due to lower cash flow from operating and investing activities as described above 

in february 2001 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program this program authorizes us to repurchase through february 14 2003 up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees during 2001 we repurchased approximately 24 million shares for approximately 100 million see note 19 for a discussion of the share repurchase program 

in 1999 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 350 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees this share repurchase program was completed in 2000 during 2000 we repurchased over 64 million shares for approximately 216 million see note 19 for a discussion of the share repurchase program 

financing activities 

as more fully discussed in note 12 our primary bank credit agreement as amended is comprised of a senior unsecured term loan facility and a 175 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was reduced from 3 billion as part of the amendment discussed below collectively referred to as the credit facilities the credit facilities mature on october 2 2002 at december 29 2001 we had unused revolving credit facility borrowings available aggregating 27 billion net of outstanding letters of credit of 02 billion 

amounts outstanding under our credit facilities of 536 million at december 29 2001 have been classified as shortterm borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet due to the october 2002 maturity we are currently in negotiations to replace the credit facilities prior to the maturity date with new borrowings which will reflect the market conditions and terms available at that time 

the credit facilities subject us to certain mandatory principal repayment obligations including prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement interest on the credit facilities is based principally on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable margin factor therefore our borrowing costs fluctuate depending upon the volatility in libor 

on february 22 2002 we entered into an agreement to amend certain terms of our credit facilities this amendment provides for among other things additional flexibility with respect to acquisitions and other investments in addition we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the revolving credit facility from 30 billion to 175 billion as a result of this amendment we capitalized debt costs of approximately 15 million these costs will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the credit facilities 

we issued 850 million of unsecured notes in 2001 the issuance included 200 million of 85 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2006 and 650 million of 8875 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2011 we used the proceeds net of issuance costs to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facilities we still have 550 million available for issuance under a 2 billion shelf registration see note 12 for further discussion 

we use derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps to lower interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate risk see notes 2 and 14 as well as our market risk disclosure for further discussion of our interest rate risk 

consolidated financial condition 

assets increased 239 million or 6 to 44 billion the increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in property plant and equipment driven by capital spending and acquisitions in excess of depreciation refranchising and disposition of assets the fair value of derivatives recorded as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by a reduction in net receivables primarily related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 

liabilities decreased 187 million or 4 to 43 billion the decrease was primarily attributable to net paydown of debt partially offset by increases related to the adoption of sfas 133 

liquidity 

operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations which require a limited tricon investment in operating assets typically our cash flows include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations we believe our operating cash flows and our ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2002 and beyond 

significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 29 2001 due by year include 

less than 1 year 13 years 45 years thereafter total      longterm debta  537  2  551  900  1990 shortterm borrowings 151    151      debt excluding capital leases 688 2 551 900 2141 operating leasesb 221 383 294 893 1791 capital leasesb 11 22 17 87 137 franchisee financing obligations 15 14   29      contractual obligations  935  421  862  1880  4098      excludes the derivative instrument adjustment which is discussed in note 14 these obligations which are shown on a nominal basis relate to operating and capital leases for approximately 4400 restaurants see note 12 for a discussion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt and note 13 for a discussion of leases 

in addition we have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events as of december 29 2001 the maximum exposure under these commercial commitments which are shown on a nominal basis include 

contingent liabilities associated with lease assignments  435 standby letters of credita 204 guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates debt 12 other commercial commitments 44 includes 32 million related to guarantees of financial arrangements of franchisees which are supported by standby letters of credit see notes 12 and 22 for a further discussion of these commitments 

our unconsolidated affiliates also have longterm debt outstanding as of december 29 2001 this debt totaled approximately 134 million our share of which was approximately 68 million as noted above we have guaranteed 12 million of this total debt obligation our unconsolidated affiliates had total assets of over 900 million as of yearend 2001 and total revenues of approximately 16 billion in 2001 

other significant known events trends or uncertainties expected to impact 2002 ongoing operating profit comparisons with 2001 

euro conversion 

twelve of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union adopted the euro as a common legal currency we have company and franchise businesses in the adopting member countries beginning january 1 2002 new eurodenominated bills and coins were issued and a transition period of two months began during the transition period local currencies were removed from circulation we took actions to mitigate our risks related to the euro conversion efforts including the rollout of euroready pointofsale pos equipment and backofhouse hardware and software we have not experienced any significant issues or unexpected business problems resulting from the euro conversion given the absence of any significant problems to date we do not expect euro conversion issues to have a material adverse effect on tricons operations or financial results in 2002 

expenditures associated with our conversion efforts totaled approximately 5 million of which 3 million was incurred during 2001 approximately 30 of these costs related to capital expenditures for new pos equipment and backofhouse hardware and software the remaining expenditures were mainly related to consulting expenses for initial impact studies and head office accounting systems we do not expect to incur significant eurorelated expenditures in 2002 

consumer acceptance of the euro has not significantly impacted our business to date from a competitive perspective we continue to assess the impact of product price transparency potential revisions to our product bundling strategies and the creation of eurofriendly price points we do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies we manage these risks through a variety of strategies which include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 

interest rate risk 

our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 

at december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result in a reduction of 4 million and 19 million respectively in annual income before taxes the estimated reductions are based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt in addition the fair value of our interest rate swaps at december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 would decrease approximately 5 million and 11 million respectively the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 would decrease approximately 72 million and 25 million respectively the significant change in the decrease of the fair market value between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to the additional senior unsecured notes issued in 2001 fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

international ongoing operating profit constituted approximately 31 and 29 of our 2001 and 2000 ongoing operating profit respectively excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss in addition the companys net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately 1 billion and 900 million as of december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 respectively operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the companys primary exposures result from our operations in asiapacific and europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 

we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical in addition we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical consequently foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany shortterm receivables and payables at times we utilize forward contracts to reduce our risk exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated on a limited basis we utilize forward contracts in order to reduce our risk exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated cash flows from royalties there were no such forward contracts outstanding as of december 29 2001 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is at times limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as on a limited basis commodity future and option contracts there were no commodity future and option contracts outstanding at december 29 2001 and those outstanding at december 30 2000 were not significant to the consolidated financial statements 

cautionary statements 

from time to time in both written reports and oral statements we present forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the statements include those identified by such words as may will expect anticipate believe plan and other similar terminology these forwardlooking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements actual results involve risks and uncertainties including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry and could differ materially from expectations 

company risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the spinoff which if they occur require us to indemnify pepsico inc our substantial debt leverage and the attendant potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future as well as our substantial interest expense and principal repayment obligations our ability to replace or refinance the credit facilities at reasonable rates potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities including the liabilities related to the sale of the noncore businesses our ability to secure alternative distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores our ability to complete our euro conversion plans or the ability of our key suppliers to be eurocompliant the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies

narrative description of business general 

tricon is the worlds largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on number of system units with more than 30400 units in over 100 countries and territories the tricon organization is currently made up of four operating companies organized around its three core concepts kfc pizza hut and taco bell the concepts the four operating companies are kfc pizza hut taco bell and tricon restaurants international kfc is based in louisville kentucky pizza hut and tricon restaurants international are based in dallas texas and taco bell is based in irvine california 

restaurant concepts 

through its three widelyrecognized concepts the company develops operates franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items these restaurants are operated by the company or under the terms of franchise or license agreements by franchisees or licensees who are independent third parties or by international affiliates in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest unconsolidated affiliates 

in each concept consumers can dine in andor carry out food in addition taco bell and kfc offer a drivethru option in many stores and pizza hut offers a drivethru option on a much more limited basis pizza hut and on a much more limited basis kfc offer delivery service 

each concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing tasty and attractive food at competitive prices 

the franchise program of the company is designed to assure consistency and quality the company is selective in granting franchises and is not in the practice of franchising to investor groups or passive investors under the standard franchise agreement franchisees supply capitalinitially by paying a franchise fee to tricon purchasing or leasing the land and building and purchasing equipment signs seating inventories and supplies and over the longer term by reinvesting in the business franchisees then contribute to the companys revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales 

the company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives to this end the company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business ranging from new products to new equipment to new management techniques 

the company is actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding where two or more of its concepts are operated in a single restaurant unit by combining two or more of its concepts in one location particularly those that have complementary daypart strengths the company believes it can generate higher sales volumes from such units significantly improve returns on per unit investment and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater number of trade areas throughout the us and internationally through the consolidation of market planning initiatives across all three of its concepts the company has established multiyear development plans by trade area to optimize franchise and company penetration of all three concepts and to improve returns on its existing asset base the development of these multibranded units may be limited in some instances by prior development andor territory rights granted to franchisees 

as of yearend 2000 there were 1195 units in the worldwide system housing more than one concept of these 1160 units offer food products from two of the concepts a 2n1 and 35 units offer food products from each of the concepts a 3n1 on a much more limited basis the company is testing multibrand options involving one of the concepts and a restaurant concept not owned by or affiliated with the company 

restaurant operations 

through its concepts tricon develops operates franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and nontraditional qsr restaurants traditional units feature dinein carryout and in some instances drivethru or delivery services nontraditional units which are typically licensed outlets include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in nontraditional locations like airports gasoline service

stations convenience stores stadiums amusement parks and colleges where a fullscale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 

the companys restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size generally each company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager rgm together with one or more assistant managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant usually has between 10 and 35 hourly employees most of whom work parttime the companys four operating companies each issue detailed manuals covering all aspects of their respective operations including food handling and product preparation procedures safety and quality issues equipment maintenance facility standards and accounting control procedures the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards rgms efforts are monitored by area managers or market coaches who work with approximately nine to eleven restaurants the companys restaurants are visited from time to time by various senior operators within their respective organizations to help ensure adherence to system standards 

rgms attend and complete their respective operating companys required training programs these programs consist of initial training as well as additional continuing development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to time initial manager training programs generally last at least six weeks and emphasize leadership business management supervisory skills including training coaching and recruiting product preparation and production safety quality control customer service labor management and equipment maintenance 

following is a brief description of each concept

throughout managements discussion and analysis mda we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net gain unusual items and our accounting and human resources policy changes in 1999 collectively the 1999 accounting changes see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to forecast future performance ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the us and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 

in 2000 our international business tricon restaurants international tri or international accounted for 35 of system sales 29 of total revenues and 29 of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses we anticipate that despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential 

this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages 3975 and the cautionary statements on pages 3637 all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 4375 tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts or as otherwise specifically identified

  kraft taco shell recall 

in the fourth quarter of 2000 allegations were made by a public environmental advocacy group that testing of corn taco shells sold by kraft foods inc kraft in grocery stores under a license to use the taco bell brand name had indicated the presence of genetically modified gm corn which had only been approved by the applicable us governmental agencies for animal consumption in light of the allegations kraft recalled this product line we are not aware of any evidence that suggests that the gm corn at issue presents any significant health risk to humans nonetheless consistent with our overall quality assurance procedures we have taken significant actions to ensure that our restaurant supply chain is free of products containing the gm corn in question and we will continue to take whatever actions are prudent or appropriate in this regard 

although we are unable to estimate the amount we believe that our taco bell restaurants have experienced a negative impact on sales following the allegations and the kraft recall we do not currently believe this sales impact will be sustained over the long term 

  franchisee financial condition 

like others in the qsr industry from time to time some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations at present certain of our franchise operators principally in the taco bell system are facing varying degrees of financial problems primarily as a result of declines in store sales in the taco bell system which we believe have been exacerbated by the grocery product recalls of corn taco shells by kraft in the fourth quarter of 2000 

depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation and in the absence of an improvement in business trends there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues including a sale of some or all of the operators restaurants to us or a third party a restructuring of the operators business andor finances or in the more unusual cases bankruptcy of the operator it is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues 

taco bell has established a 15 million loan program for those franchisees in need of shortterm assistance due to the recent sales declines in the taco bell system through february 2001 this program has aided approximately 75 franchisees covering approximately 1500 taco bell restaurants additionally taco bell is in various stages of discussions with a number of other taco bell franchisees and their lenders we believe that many of these franchisees will require various types of business andor financial restructuring based on currently available information we believe that this group of franchisees represents approximately 1000 taco bell restaurants 

in 2000 we charged approximately 26 million to ongoing operating profit for expenses related to the financial situation of certain taco bell franchisees these expenses which relate primarily to allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables were reported as general and administrative expenses on an ongoing basis we assess our exposure from franchiserelated risks which include estimated uncollectibility of accounts receivable related to franchise and license fees contingent lease liabilities guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements with franchisees and potential claims by franchisees the contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the contingent liabilities section of note 21 although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure to the company as of december 30 2000 it is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs which could be material to quarterly or annual results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

based on the information currently available to us we have budgeted for an estimate of expenses and capital expenditures that may be required to address this situation however the taco bell franchise financial situation poses certain risks and uncertainties to us the more significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below significant adverse developments in this situation or in any of these risks or uncertainties could have a material adverse impact on our quarterly or annual results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we intend to continue to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues however there can be no assurance that the number of franchise operators or restaurants experiencing financial difficulties will not change from our current estimates nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in resolving financial issues relating to any specific franchise operator additionally there can be no assurance that resolution of these financial issues will not result in taco bell purchasing a significant number of restaurants from financially troubled taco bell franchise operators 

  unusual items 

we recorded unusual items of 204 million 129 million aftertax 51 million 29 million aftertax and 15 million 3 million aftertax in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively see note 5 for a detailed discussion of our unusual items 

  fiftythird week in 2000

  store portfolio strategy 

beginning in 1995 we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets this portfoliobalancing activity has reduced and will continue to reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and has increased the importance of system sales as a key performance measure we expect to substantially complete our refranchising program in 2001 

the following table summarizes our refranchising activities for the last three years 

2000 1999 1998    number of units refranchised 757 1435 1373 refranchising proceeds pretax  381  916  784 refranchising net gains pretax  200  422  279 in addition to our refranchising program we have been closing restaurants over the past several years restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants restaurants that are relocated to a new site within the

in 1999 our restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 190 basis points the portfolio effect contributed nearly 50 basis points and accounting changes contributed approximately 15 basis points to our improvement excluding these items our base restaurant margin increased approximately 125 basis points this improvement was primarily attributable to effective net pricing in excess of cost increases primarily higher wage rates in the us restaurant margin also benefited from improved food and paper cost management in both the us and certain key international equity markets volume increases at pizza hut in the us and in certain key international equity markets were fully offset by volume declines at taco bell and the unfavorable impact of the introduction of lower margin chicken sandwiches at kfc in the us 

worldwide general  administrative expenses ga declined 41 million or 4 in 2000 excluding the benefit from lapping the 1999 accounting changes ongoing ga decreased 59 million or 6 the decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and year 2000 costs as well as the favorable impact of the portfolio effect reduced spending on conferences also contributed to the decline the decrease was partially offset by higher franchiserelated expenses primarily allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables as more fully discussed in the franchisee financial condition section ga included year 2000 spending of approximately 2 million in 2000 as compared to approximately 30 million in 1999 

in 1999 ga decreased 21 million or 2 excluding the 18 million favorable impact of the 1999 accounting changes ga decreased 3 million the favorable impacts of the portfolio effect our fourth quarter 1998 decision to streamline our international business and the absence of costs associated with relocating certain operations from wichita kansas in 1998 were partially offset by higher strategic and other

corporate expenses in addition higher spending on conferences and the absence of favorable cost recovery agreements with ameriserve and pepsico also partially offset the decreases discussed above

in 1999 other income expense declined 8 million or 31 the decline was primarily due to foreign exchange losses in 1999 versus gains in 1998 related to us dollar denominated shortterm investments in canada 

worldwide facility actions net gain we recorded facility actions net gain of 176 million in 2000 381 million in 1999 and 275 million in 1998 see the store portfolio strategy section for more details regarding our refranchising and closure activities and note 5 for a summary of the components of facility actions net gain by operating segment 

impairment charges for stores that will continue to be used in the business were 8 million in 2000 compared to 16 million in 1999 and 25 million in 1998 reflecting fewer underperforming stores as a result of the adoption of the secs interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets sfas 121 in 1998 we perform impairment evaluations when we expect to actually close a store beyond the quarter in which our closure decision is made this change resulted in additional impairment charges of 6 million in 2000 12 million in 1999 and 6 million in 1998 under our prior accounting policy these impairment charges would have been included in store closure costs in the quarter in which the closure decision was made

ongoing unallocated and corporate expenses decreased 31 million or 16 in 2000 the decline was primarily due to lower year 2000 spending and lower incentive compensation expense 

in 1999 ongoing unallocated and corporate expenses increased 25 million or 14 the increase was driven by higher strategic and other corporate spending system standardization investment spending and the absence of favorable cost recovery agreements from ameriserve and pepsico these increases were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with relocating certain of our operations from wichita kansas in 1998

in 1999 our net interest expense decreased 70 million or 26 the decline was primarily due to the reduction of debt through use of aftertax cash proceeds from our refranchising activities and cash from operations

in 2000 the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the us federal statutory rate due to our ability to claim foreign taxes paid against our us income tax liability the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations in 1999 and 1998 was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate this was primarily due to foreign tax rate differentials including foreign withholding tax paid without benefit of the related foreign tax credit for us income tax purposes and losses of foreign operations for which no tax benefit could be currently recognized 

the 1999 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 30 percentage points to 393 the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a onetime favorable international benefit in mexico the recent pattern of profitability in mexico and expectations of future profitability have allowed us to reverse a previous valuation allowance against deferred tax assets this will enable us to reduce future cash tax payments in mexico

international system sales system sales increased 399 million or 6 in 2000 after a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the fiftythird week in 2000 system sales increased 7 this increase was driven by new unit development led by china korea and japan and same store sales growth the increase was partially offset by store closures 

in 1999 system sales increased 639 million or 10 including a 2 favorable impact from foreign currency translation this increase was largely driven by strong performance in asia where system sales increased 426 million or 19 including a 10 favorable impact of foreign currency translation in 1999 the economy in asia began to show signs of a steady recovery after the overall economic turmoil and weakening of local currencies against the us dollar that began in late 1997 the increase in system sales in asia was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth outside of asia the improvement was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth the increases were partially offset by store closures primarily by franchisees in canada latin america and japan 

international revenues company sales decreased 74 million or 4 in 2000 after a 3 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as expected the decline in company sales was primarily due to the portfolio effect partially offset by the favorable impact from the fiftythird week in 2000 excluding all three of these items company sales increased 11 primarily due to new unit development and favorable effective net pricing 

franchise and license fees increased approximately 31 million or 14 in 2000 after a 3 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact from the fiftythird week in 2000 franchise and license fees increased 16 the increase was driven by new unit development units acquired from us and franchisee same store sales growth these increases were partially offset by store closures

restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 140 basis points in 1999 excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation restaurant margin increased approximately 130 basis 

points portfolio effect contributed approximately 50 basis points excluding these items our base restaurant margin grew approximately 80 basis points the improvement was driven by volume increases in china korea and australia and favorable effective net pricing in excess of cost increases primarily in the united kingdom puerto rico and korea our growth in 1999 was partially offset by volume decreases in taiwan and poland in addition to the factors described above restaurant margin benefited from improved cost management primarily in china 

international ongoing operating profit ongoing operating profit grew 44 million or 16 in 2000 after a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation excluding the negative impacts of the portfolio effect and foreign currency translation and the favorable impact from the fiftythird week in 2000 ongoing operating profit grew 19 higher franchise and license fees and company new unit development drove the increase 

in 1999 ongoing operating profit grew 74 million or 39 including a 3 favorable impact from foreign currency translation the increase in operating profit was driven by our base margin improvement of approximately 80 basis points higher franchise and license fees and a decline in ga ongoing operating profit benefited from the economic recovery in asia operating profit in asia increased 55 million or 84 including a 12 favorable impact from foreign currency translation additionally ongoing operating profit included benefits of approximately 15 million principally from our 1998 fourth quarter decision to streamline our international infrastructure in asia europe and latin america 

consolidated cash flows   net cash provided by operating activities decreased 74 million to 491 million primarily due to unusual charges associated with the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process changes in operating working capital reflected a net use of cash of 207 million the primary drivers of the net use were receivables from the ameriserve bankruptcy estate and franchisee receivables arising from the companys program to temporarily purchase food and supply inventories directly from third party suppliers for the tricon system and sell a portion of these supplies to franchisees and licensees the temporary direct purchase program related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process these items resulted in a net cash usage of approximately 135 million of working capital see note 21 for a discussion of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 

excluding the ameriserverelated items noted above our operating working capital deficit reflects a decrease of 63 million versus a decrease of 128 million in the prior year our operating working capital deficit which excludes cash shortterm investments and shortterm borrowings is typical of restaurant operations where the majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers carry longer payment terms generally from 1030 days the lower working capital deficit reduction in 2000 is the result of refranchising significantly fewer restaurants in 2000 versus 1999 as well as a change in payment terms in our distribution agreement from 30 to 15 days 

in 1999 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 109 million to 565 million the decline was primarily due to a 128 million decrease in our working capital deficit this decrease was driven by our portfolio activities which resulted in a significant reduction in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable 

  net cash used in investing activities was 237 million in 2000 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 522 million in 1999 the decline in cash flow from investing activities was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants to franchisees in 2000 versus 

1999 increased capital spending related to development and funding of ameriserve during its bankruptcy reorganization process 

in 1999 net cash provided by investing activities increased 220 million to 522 million the majority of the increase is due to higher gross refranchising proceeds and proceeds from the sale of international shortterm investments in connection with a planned taxefficient repatriation to the us 

although we report gross proceeds in our consolidated statements of cash flows we also consider refranchising proceeds on an aftertax basis we define aftertax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities primarily accounts payable and property taxes related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains the aftertax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares aftertax proceeds were approximately 261 million in 2000 which reflects a 62 decrease from 1999 this decrease was due to the refranchising of significantly fewer restaurants in 2000 aftertax proceeds were approximately 683 million in 1999 a 13 increase versus 1998 the increase was principally due to a greater number of units refranchised as well as the mix of restaurants sold and the level of taxable gains from each refranchising 

  net cash used in financing activities was 207 million compared to 11 billion last year less cash was available for financing activities in 2000 due to a net cash use from investing activities as described above and a use of cash to fund increased share repurchases as more fully discussed in note 18 accordingly we repaid less debt in 2000 than 1999 

in 1999 net cash used in financing activities was essentially unchanged versus 1998 at 11 billion payments on our unsecured term loan facility and our unsecured revolving credit facility totaled 10 billion 

in 1999 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 350 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees this share repurchase program was completed in 2000 during 2000 we repurchased over 64 million shares for approximately 216 million during 1999 we repurchased over 33 million shares for approximately 134 million see note 18 

on february 14 2001 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program as more fully described in note 18 the new share repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase over the next two years up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees we have not repurchased any shares under this program as of march 9 2001 

financing activities our primary bank credit agreement as amended in 2000 and 1999 is comprised of a senior unsecured term loan facility and a 3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively referred to as the credit facilities both of which mature on october 2 2002 amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility are expected to fluctuate but term loan facility reductions may not be reborrowed at december 30 2000 we had unused revolving credit facility borrowings available aggregating 18 billion net of outstanding letters of credit of 190 million we believe that we will be able to refinance a portion of our credit facilities with publicly issued bonds within the next twelve months as a result of this refinancing we are likely to experience an increase in our interest rates subject to rates available at the time of refinancing we also believe we will be able to replace or refinance the remaining credit facilities prior to maturity with new borrowings which will reflect the market conditions or terms available at that time 

the credit facilities subject us to significant interest expense and principal repayment obligations which are limited in the near term to prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement interest on the credit

facilities is based principally on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable margin factor as defined in the credit agreement therefore our future borrowing costs may fluctuate depending upon the volatility in libor we currently mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments see notes 11 and 13 and our market risk discussion for further discussions of our interest rate risk 

consolidated financial condition   assets increased 188 million or 5 to 41 billion the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in receivables arising from the impact of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process as more fully discussed in note 21 

  liabilities decreased 50 million or 1 to 45 billion 

excluding the impact of the aforementioned increase in accounts receivable arising from the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process our working capital deficit decreased 8 to approximately 769 million at december 30 2000 from 832 million at december 25 1999 the decline was primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable related to fewer company restaurants as a result of our portfolio actions a change in payment terms to our new primary us distributor of food and paper and a reduction in accrued compensation these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes 

we believe the company has adequate financial resources to meet its requirements in 2001 and beyond 

other significant known events trends or uncertainties expected to impact 2001 ongoing operating profit comparisons with 2000 

  impact of new unconsolidated affiliates 

consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets we entered into an agreement in 1999 to form a new venture during 2000 in canada with our largest franchisee in that market during the third quarter of 2000 we contributed 320 restaurants in exchange for a 50 equity interest in the venture these stores represented approximately 16 of the total international company restaurants at the time of the formation of the new venture including the stores contributed by our partner the new venture had approximately 650 restaurants at the time of formation we did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to this new venture 

previously the results from the restaurants we contributed to the canadian venture were consolidated the impact of this transaction on operating results is similar to the portfolio effect of our refranchising activities consequently this transaction will result in a decline in our company sales restaurant margin dollars and ga expenses as well as higher franchise fees and equity income in addition to the portfolio effect franchise fees will be higher since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to this venture the overall impact from the formation of this venture on 2000 ongoing operating profit was slightly favorable had this venture been formed at the beginning of 2000 our international company sales would have declined approximately 10 compared to the reported decline of 4 for the year ended december 30 2000 

in addition we anticipate contributing about 50 restaurants to a new venture in poland to be formed in 2001 we believe the impact on ongoing operating profit from the formation of the venture will not be significant 

  impact of the consolidation of an unconsolidated affiliate 

beginning in fiscal 2001 we will consolidate a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate while we believe that the overall impact on our ongoing operating profit will not be significant this change is expected to result in higher company sales restaurant margin dollars and ga as well as decreased franchise fees and equity income had this change occurred at the beginning of 2000 our international company sales would have increased approximately 2 compared to the reported decline of 4 for the year ended december 30 2000 

  change in casualty loss estimates 

due to the inherent volatility of our actuariallydetermined casualty loss estimates it is reasonably possible that we will experience changes in estimated losses which could be material to our growth in ongoing operating profit in 2001 see note 21 for a discussion of our casualty loss programs and estimates 

  euro conversion 

on january 1 1999 eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted the euro as a common legal currency and fixed conversion rates were established greece has since adopted the single currency on january 1 2001 taking the total adopting countries to twelve from january 1 1999 through no later than february 28 2002 all adopting countries will maintain a period of dual currency where both legacy currencies and the euro can be used in daytoday credit transactions beginning january 1 2002 new eurodenominated bills and coins will be issued and a transition period of up to two months will begin during which local currencies will be removed from circulation 

we have company and franchised businesses in the adopting member countries which are preparing for the conversion to date expenditures associated with our conversion efforts have been relatively insignificant totaling under 2 million these expenditures have been concentrated mainly on consulting expenses for initial impact studies and head office accounting systems we currently estimate that the total spending over the transition period will be approximately 5 million related to the conversion in the emu member countries in which we operate stores this is a reduction from our previous estimate of 10 million primarily due to the refranchising of company stores in certain emu countries approximately 45 of these expenditures relate to capital expenditures for new pointofsale and backofrestaurant hardware and software to accommodate eurodenominated transactions we believe that adoption of the euro by the united kingdom would significantly increase this estimate due to the size of our businesses there relative to our aggregate businesses in the adopting member countries in which we operate 

the pace of ultimate consumer acceptance of and our competitors responses to the euro are currently unknown and may impact our existing plans however we know that from a competitive perspective we will be required to assess the impacts of product price transparency potentially revise product bundling strategies and create eurofriendly price points prior to 2002 we do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses although the euro does offer certain benefits to our treasury and procurement activities these are not currently anticipated to be significant 

we currently anticipate that our suppliers and distributors will continue to invoice us in local currencies until late 2001 we expect to begin dual pricing in our restaurants in late 2001 we expect to compensate employees in euros beginning in 2002 we believe that the most critical activity regarding the conversion for our businesses is the completion of the rollout of euroready pointofsale equipment and software by the end of 2001 our current plans should enable us to be eurocompliant prior to the requirements for these changes any delays in our ability to complete our plans or in the ability of our key suppliers to be eurocompliant could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of financial instruments market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates principally in the united states we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through utilization of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps collars and forward rate agreements 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations we attempt to minimize the risk exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations on our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical we also use forward contracts on a limited basis to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated financial instruments and significant foreign currency denominated cash flows additionally certain foreign currency denominated cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to tax considerations and local regulatory restrictions which limit our ability to utilize these funds outside the country in which they are held 

at december 30 2000 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would result in a reduction of 19 million in annual income before income taxes the estimated reduction is based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december 30 2000 in addition the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts would decrease approximately 11 million in value to us and the fair value of our senior unsecured notes would decrease approximately 25 million fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows
