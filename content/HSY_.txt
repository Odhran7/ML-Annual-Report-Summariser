principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2021 approximately 30 of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states “us” to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 



in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse changes in climate or extreme weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

our trading company in switzerland performs all aspects of cocoa procurement including price risk management physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight the trading company optimizes the supply chain for our cocoa requirements with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence it also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar corn products class ii and iv dairy products wheat products peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain international markets we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service we have also experienced increased competition from other snack items and through innovation and acquisitions we are continuing to expand the boundaries of our brands to capture new snacking occasions 



working capital seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business operating results liquidity and financial condition while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business performance or financial condition in the future 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by the failure to successfully manage a disruption in consumer and trade patterns as well as operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” global pandemic 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels impulse purchases the availability of our products at retail and our ability to manufacture store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as the covid19 pandemic can negatively impact our overall business and financial results specific factors that may impact our operations some of which have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of covid19 include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our products or pantryloading activity if prolonged such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results 

• significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers common carriers or other shippers modifying restocking fulfillment and shipping practices 

• the inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or finished product components transportation resources workforce availability or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• the inability to effectively manage evolving health and welfare strategies including but not limited to ongoing or not yet fully known costs related to operational adjustments to ensure continued employee and consumer safety and adherence to health guidelines as they are modified and supplemented 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer viewing and shopping habits due to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting and entertainment events reduced instore visits travel restrictions and a shift in customer advertising priorities among other things 

• the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may negatively impact our operations or 

• significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently 



staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could negatively impact our results 

with respect to covid19 the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change the company’s efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may ultimately be unsuccessful and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control including the duration and severity of any disease outbreak as well as thirdparty actions taken in response 

risks related to our business and operations 

our company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging human and workplace rights and other environmental social or governance matters which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers consumers suppliers vendors and employees among others issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation we have in the past and may in the future need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions in addition negative publicity related to our environmental social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers consumers suppliers and vendors 

we have in the past and in the future could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging human and workplace rights and other environmental social or governance matters which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions as well as the potential impact on our reputation or ability to sell our products could negatively affect our operating results 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately 70 of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 

• natural disaster 

• pandemic outbreak of disease 

• climate change and severity of extreme weather 

• fire or explosion 

• terrorism or other acts of violence 

• labor strikes or other labor activities 

• unavailability of raw or packaging materials 

• operational andor financial instability of key suppliers and other vendors or service providers and 

• suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to costeffectively meet product demand 

we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for mitigate or manage operational stability and business resiliency particularly within our international markets and snacks portfolio due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 



we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global human capital we need to drive our growth strategies 

our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus and evolving views of our customers stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change issues could negatively affect our business and operations 

climaterelated changes can increase variability in or otherwise impact natural disasters including weather patterns with the potential for increased frequency and severity of significant weather events natural hazards rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns climate change or weatherrelated disruptions to our supply chain can impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs 

increased focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change including regulation of ghg emissions new or increasing laws and regulations related to ghg emissions and other climate change related concerns may adversely affect us our suppliers and our customers and may require additional capital investments our value chain faces similar challenges as our products rely on agricultural ingredients and a global supply chain climate change poses a significant and increasing risk to global food production systems and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live work and source our ingredients the ghg impacts of landuse change are most pronounced in our cocoa supply chain where we have already been working for several years to prevent deforestation additionally any noncompliance with legislative and regulatory requirements could negatively impact our reputation and ability to do business 

investors customers advisory services government regulators and other market participants have increasingly focused on the environmental or sustainability practices of companies including hershey shareholders and financial institutions have increasingly evaluated a company’s esg practices disclosures and performance before making investments or other financial decisions we believe our practices disclosures and performance are strong and growing however if our environmental goals do not meet investor or other external stakeholder expectations and standards our access to capital may be negatively impacted an enforcement action could harm our reputation financial position and ability to grow a failure to meet expectations may adversely affect our results of operations ability to manage our liquidity or implement our strategies 

the company publishes its environmental goals with a particular focus on achieving a 50 absolute reduction in our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions and a 25 absolute reduction in our scope 3 ghg emissions by 2030 compared to a 2018 baseline as well as having 100 of plastic packaging be reusable recyclable or compostable and 25 million pounds of packaging be eliminated by 2030 the costs of these voluntary commitments may be greater than expected and there can be no assurance the company will achieve its goals or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors or other external stakeholders any failure to achieve our goals a perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or failure to respond to new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business reputation and increase risk of litigation 



the effects and costs of climate change or any failure to meet related requirements and expectations could have a negative impact on our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to the industry in which we operate 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar corn products dairy products wheat products peanuts almonds natural gas and diesel fuel 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

• commodity market fluctuations 

• currency exchanges rates 

• imbalances between supply and demand 

• rising levels of inflation related to domestic and global economic conditions or supply chain issues 

• the effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality 

• speculative influences 

• trade agreements among producing and consuming nations 

• supplier compliance with commitments 

• importexport requirements for raw materials and finished goods 

• political unrest in producing countries 

• introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements and 

• changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies 

although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes including if inflation outpaces our pricing elasticity sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging freight direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 

• effective retail execution 

• appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs 

• our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations 

• our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories 

• changes in product category consumption 

• our response to consumer demographics and trends including but not limited to trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel and 

• consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients 



there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 30 of our total net sales in 2021 mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery and snacks packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

risks related to strategic initiatives 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in 2021 we successfully completed the divestiture of lsfc as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities additionally we completed the acquisitions of lily’s in june 2021 and dot’s and pretzels in december 2021 while we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage hershey’s resources expertise capabilitybuilding distribution locations and customer base in addition the acquisitions of dot’s and pretzels are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key subsegment of the warehouse snack aisle if we are unable to successfully couple hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with lily’s dot’s and pretzels’ existing operations it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace 



our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we derived approximately 130 136 and 158 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally approximately 19 of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2021 as part of our strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly in canada malaysia mexico brazil and india as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

• the inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption supply constraints inflation deflation or decreased demand 

• the inability to establish develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets 

• difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

• political and economic instability including the possibility of civil unrest terrorism mass violence or armed conflict 

• nationalization of our properties by foreign governments 

• tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

• increased costs disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation 

• the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies 

• failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets and 

• failure to recruit retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce 

if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may not fully realize the expected costs savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs which may have an adverse impact on our business 

we depend on our ability to evolve and grow and as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce to transform our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights if we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain longterm sustainable growth such as the international optimization program which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020 this program is intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency to reduce our costs andor to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs or that the benefits even if achieved will be adequate to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations which could in turn adversely affect our business 



risks related to governmental and regulatory changes 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation compliance and requirements competition laws employment laws importexport requirements and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions broad political instability rising unemployment pandemic outbreak of disease climate change weather natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

risks related to digital transformation cybersecurity and data privacy 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we are regularly the target of cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industryaccepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business resiliency preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems 

while we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business this in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 



complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp system without experiencing further delays increased costs and other difficulties if we are unable to successfully design and implement the new erp system as planned our financial positions results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the erp system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed

we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america a leading snack maker in the united states and a global leader in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery we report our operations through three segments i north america confectionery ii north america salty snacks and iii international as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

our vision is to be a snacking powerhouse we aspire to be a leader in meeting consumers’ evolving snacking needs while strengthening the capabilities that drive our growth we are focused on four strategic imperatives to ensure the company’s success now and in the future 

• drive core confection business and broaden participation in snacking  we continue to be the undisputed leader in us confection by taking actions to deepen our consumer connections and utilize our beloved brands to deliver meaningful innovation while also diversifying our portfolio to capture profitable and incremental growth across the broader snacking continuum 

◦ our products frequently play an important role in special moments among family and friends seasons are an important part of our business model and for consumers they are highly anticipated cherished times centered around traditions for us it’s an opportunity for our brands to be part of many connections during the year when family and friends gather 

◦ innovation is an important lever in this varietyseeking category and we are leveraging work from our proprietary demand landscape analytical tool to shape our future innovation and make it more impactful we are becoming more disciplined in our focus on platform innovation which should enable sustainable growth over time and significant extensions to our core 

◦ to expand our breadth in snacking we are focused on expanding the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions and increasing our exposure into new snack categories through acquisitions our expansion into snacking is being fueled by the recent acquisitions of dot’s and pretzels in december 2021 which is included in our north america salty snacks segment 

• deliver profitable international growth  we are focused on ensuring that we efficiently allocate our resources to the areas with the highest potential for profitable growth we have reset our international investment strategy while holding fast to our belief that our targeted emerging market strategy will deliver longterm profitable growth the uncertain macroeconomic environment in many of these markets is expected to continue and we aim to ensure our investments in these international markets are appropriate relative to the size of the opportunity

◦ we believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success in 2021 we changed our global employee survey from an annual basis to continuous listening surveys throughout the year these shorter and faster surveys reach all of our employees around the world to hear their thoughts on the company’s direction and their place in it the change from an annual survey to continuous touchpoints allows for realtime feedback and action from the company and creates stronger employee engagement with the company’s strategy initiatives and leadership 

◦ our diverse and inclusive culture makes the difference across all areas of the business our gender representation includes women occupying many of the top positions in the company including chief executive officer and chairman of the board chief accounting officer and chief growth officer and approximately 50 representation across the company in 2020 we achieved 11 aggregate gender pay and in 2021 we achieved 11 aggregate people of color pay equity for salaried employees in the united states

trends affecting our business 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization designated covid19 as a global pandemic which has spread worldwide and impacted various markets around the world including the us various policies and initiatives have been implemented to reduce the global transmission of covid19 

since the onset of covid19 there has been minimal disruption to our supply chain network however during 2021 continued strong demand for consumer goods and the effects of covid19 mitigation strategies have led to broadbased supply chain disruptions across the us and globally including inflation on many consumer products labor shortages and demand outpacing supply as a result we experienced corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures during the year ended december 31 2021 see results of operations included in this mda we are working closely with our business units contract manufacturers distributors contractors and other external business partners to minimize the potential impact on our business 

during 2021 many state governments began easing covid19 restrictions resulting in increased travel during the summer and holiday seasons full capacity at major sporting and entertainment events increased occupancy limits for indoor gatherings and the removal of face covering requirements subject to certain exceptions this contributed to a resurgence of covid19 cases and the spread of covid19 variants which experts believe has peaked in recent weeks in many jurisdictions the availability of vaccinations including vaccine boosters continues to increase around the world albeit with slower than anticipated rollouts and challenges within certain countries 

we experienced an increase in our net sales and net income during the year ended december 31 2021 which was primarily driven by strong everyday performance on our core us confection brands and salty snack brands see segment results included in this mda partially offset by the aforementioned supply chain disruptions and gross margin pressures as of december 31 2021 we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our key strategic initiatives and other material cash requirements however we continue to evaluate and take action as necessary to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can operate effectively during the current economic environment we continue to monitor our discretionary spending across the organization see liquidity and capital resources included in this mda 

based on the length and severity of covid19 including broadbased supply chain disruptions rising levels of inflation new trends in outbreaks and hotspots the spread of covid19 variants resurgences and the continued distribution of vaccinations we may experience continued volatility in retail foot traffic consumer shopping and consumption behavior and may experience increasing supply chain costs and higher inflation we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts to our business consolidated results of operations segment results liquidity and capital resources

longlived and intangible asset impairment charges 

in 2021 we recorded no impairments charges in 2020 and 2019 we recorded the following impairment charges 

1 in connection with our lsfc disposal group which was previously classified as held for sale during 2020 and 2019 we recorded impairment charges to adjust longlived asset values the fair value of the disposal group was supported by potential sales prices with thirdparty buyers the sale of the lsfc joint venture was completed in january 2021 

2 in connection with a previous sale the company wrotedown certain receivables deemed uncollectible 

3 during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded impairment charges to write down customer relationship and trademark intangible assets associated with krave these charges were determined by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value with the primary techniques being discounted cash flow analysis and relieffromroyalty valuation approaches which use significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy 

4 during 2019 we recorded impairment charges predominantly comprised of select longlived assets that had not yet met the held for sale criteria the fair value of these assets was supported by potential sales prices with thirdparty buyers and market analysis 

the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions

segment results 

since december 31 2014 the company has reported its operations through two segments i north america and ii international and other after the completion of the company’s acquisitions of dot’s and pretzels in december 2021 as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management of the company has elected to begin reporting its operations through three reportable segments therefore effective in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company realigned its former two reportable segments into three reportable segments i north america confectionery ii north america salty snacks and iii international we have retroactively reflected these changes in all historical periods presented 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three reportable segments north america confectionery north america salty snacks and international for segment reporting purposes we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses unallocated marktomarket gains and losses on commodity derivatives business realignment and impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation segment income and segment income margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations 

our segment results including a reconciliation to our consolidated results were as follows 



1 includes centrallymanaged a corporate functional costs relating to legal treasury finance and human resources b expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations including warehousing distribution and manufacturing information systems and global shared services c noncash stockbased compensation expense d acquisitionrelated costs and e other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance

our international segment income decreased 506 million in 2020 compared to 2019 this decrease was driven by the lower level of net sales associated with the covid19 disruption 



unallocated corporate expense

unallocated corporate expense totaled 5207 million in 2020 as compared to 5326 million in 2019 primarily driven by savings in travel and meeting expenses related to covid19 travel restrictions and project timing shifts 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial amounts of cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

we generated cash of 21 billion from operating activities in 2021 an increase of 3833 million compared to 17 billion in 2020 this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors 

• net working capital comprised of trade accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated cash of 47 million in 2021 and consumed cash of 166 million in 2020 this 213 million fluctuation was mainly driven by strong demand of us inventories specifically our everyday core us confection brands and salty snack brands 

• net income adjusted for noncash charges to operations including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes longlived and intangible asset charges writedown of equity investments and other charges resulted in 185 million of higher cash flow in 2021 relative to 2020 



cash provided by operating activities in 2020 decreased 643 million relative to 2019 this increase was driven by the following factors 

• net working capital comprised of trade accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities consumed cash of 166 million in 2020 and generated cash of 60 million in 2019 this 226 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a higher yearoveryear build up of us inventories to satisfy product requirements and maintain sufficient levels to accommodate customer requirements as well as an increase in cash used by accounts receivable due to an increase in sales of us seasonal products 

• the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash inflows 

◦ net income adjusted for noncash charges to operations including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes longlived and intangible asset charges writedown of equity investments and other charges resulted in 207 million of higher cash flow in 2020 relative to 2019 

pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 284 million 345 million and 414 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 511 million 117 million and 201 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

investing activities 

our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property plant and equipment and capitalized software as well as acquisitions of businesses partially offset by proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment we used cash of 22 billion for investing activities in 2021 compared to 5313 million in 2020 with the increase in cash spend driven by higher levels of acquisition activity we used cash of 7805 million for investing activities in 2019 and the decrease in 2020 in cash spend was driven by no acquisition activity 

primary investing activities include the following 

• capital spending  capital expenditures including capitalized software primarily to support our erp system implementation capacity expansion innovation and cost savings were 4959 million in 2021 4416 million in 2020 and 3182 million in 2019 our 2021 expenditures increased compared to 2020 due to progress on capacity expansion projects and our erp system implementation our 2020 expenditures were substantially higher than 2019 expenditures due to progress on our key strategic initiatives we expect 2022 capital expenditures including capitalized software to approximate 550 million to 600 million the increase in our 2022 capital expenditures is largely driven by our key strategic initiatives including expanding the agility and capacity of the company’s supply chain and building digital infrastructure across the enterprise we intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to meet our 2022 capital requirements 

• investments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits  we make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits we invested approximately 1284 million in 2021 872 million in 2020 and 802 million in 2019 in projects qualifying for tax credits 

• business acquisitions  in 2021 we spent an aggregate 16 billion to acquire lilys june 2021 as well as dot’s and pretzels december 2021 in 2020 we had no acquisition activity in 2019 we spent 4022 million to acquire one brands 



• other investing activities  in 2021 and 2020 our other investing activities were minimal in 2019 we generated 201 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and other longlived assets this included the sale of select pennsylvania facilities and land for sales proceeds of approximately 276 million resulting in a gain on the sale of 113 million 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options financing activities in 2021 used cash of 6811 million compared to cash used of 4992 million in 2020 we used cash of 11 billion for financing activities in 2019 primarily to fund acquisition activity 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 

• shortterm borrowings net in addition to utilizing cash on hand we use shortterm borrowings commercial paper and bank borrowings to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs in 2021 we generated cash flow of 8690 million predominantly through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper in 2020 we generated cash flow of 418 million due to an increase in shortterm foreign bank borrowings in 2019 we used 12 billion to reduce shortterm commercial paper borrowings and shortterm foreign bank borrowings we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in october 2019 to repay outstanding commercial paper used to fund the one brands acquisition 

• longterm debt borrowings and repayments  in february 2021 and may 2021 we repaid 847 million of 8800 debentures and 350 million of 3100 notes due upon their maturities respectively in may 2020 we issued 300 million of 0900 notes due in 2025 350 million of 1700 notes due in 2030 and 350 million of 2650 notes due in 2050 the “2020 notes” proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 notes net of discounts and issuance costs totaled 9899 million additionally in may 2020 and december 2020 we repaid 350 million of 2900 notes and 350 million of 4125 notes due upon their maturities respectively in october 2019 we issued 300 million of 205 notes due in 2024 300 million of 245 notes due in 2029 and 400 million of 3125 notes due in 2049 the “2019 notes” proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 notes net of discounts and issuance costs totaled 9896 million 

• dividend payments  total dividend payments to holders of our common stock and class b common stock were 6860 million in 2021 6407 million in 2020 and 6103 million in 2019 dividends per share of common stock increased 81 to 3410 per share in 2021 compared to 3154 per share in 2020 while dividends per share of class b common stock increased 82 in 2021 details regarding our 2021 cash dividends paid to stockholders are as follows 



• share repurchases  we repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans the value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price in addition we periodically repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to boardauthorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value details regarding our share repurchases are as follows 





in july 2018 our board of directors approved a 500 million share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2021 approximately 110 million remained available for repurchases of our common stock under this program the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date in may 2021 our board of directors approved an additional 500 million share repurchase authorization this program is to commence after the existing 2018 authorization is completed and is to be utilized at management’s discretion we expect 2022 share repurchases to be in line with our traditional buyback strategy 

• proceeds from the exercise of stock options including tax benefits we received 332 million from employee exercises of stock options net of employee taxes withheld from sharebased awards in 2021 we received 255 million and 2408 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant 

financial condition 

at december 31 2021 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3293 million at december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 11 billion our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2021 decreased 8147 million compared to the 2020 yearend balance as a result of the uses of net cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately 60 of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states during 2021 previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested however the company had previously recognized a onetime us repatriation tax due under us tax reform and as a result only an immaterial amount of withholding tax was recognized for the remainder of the company’s cash held by international subsidiaries we intend to continue to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for at least the next 12 months including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total short and longterm debt was 50 billion at december 31 2021 and 46 billion at december 31 2020 our total debt increased in 2021 mainly due to the issuance of shortterm commercial paper used to fund our 2021 acquisitions of lily’s dot’s and pretzels partially offset by the repayment of 847 million debentures that matured in february 2021 and 350 million notes that matured in may 2021 

as a source of shortterm financing we maintain a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional 500 million with the consent of the lenders as of december 31 2021 the termination date of this agreement is july 2 2024 however we may extend the termination date for up to two additional oneyear periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions as of december 31 2021 we had 680 million of available capacity under the agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2021 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2021 we had available capacity of 164 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings 



financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit rating 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short and longterm cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the trust established by milton s and catherine s hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition three representatives of hershey trust company currently serve as members of the companys board in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the trust in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company the company’s board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company as trustee for the trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

material cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our future material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with longterm notes 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments including imputed interest under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities 

3 includes the minimum rental commitments including imputed interest under noncancelable finance leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities as well as vehicles 



4 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2021 the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2021 nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

these obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs to meet those cash requirements we intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to the extent necessary we may also borrow under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility or under other shortterm borrowings and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular note maturity or acquisition to our thenavailable sources of funds to obtain additional short and longterm financing we believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future short and longterm cash requirements 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

• accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

• pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

• business acquisitions valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

• income taxes 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant during 2021 2020 and 2019 actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3 our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled 1740 million and 1956 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations our related accounting policies accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

• longterm rate of return on plan assets  the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis we consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the longterm rate of return including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the 



longterm rate of return and the actual return realized for 2021 we increased the expected return on plan assets assumption to 49 from the 48 assumption used during 2020 the historical average return compounded annually over the 20 years prior to december 31 2021 was approximately 63 

as of december 31 2021 our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 201 million we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount which is the greater of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the expected longterm rate of investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the longterm rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 10 million 

• discount rate  we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve this approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping 

a 100 basis point decrease increase in the weightedaverage pension discount rate would increase decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 6 million and the december 31 2021 pension liability would increase by approximately 97 million or decrease by approximately 83 million respectively 

pension income for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately 2 million in 2021 pension expense beyond 2022 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postemployment benefit plans 

changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

• discount rate  the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations of the opeb plans is discussed in the pension plans section above a 100 basis point decrease increase in the discount rate assumption for these plans would not be material to the opeb plans’ consolidated expense and the december 31 2021 benefit liability would increase by approximately 23 million or decrease by approximately 19 million respectively 

business acquisitions valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

we use the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions under the acquisition method the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 



we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and companyspecific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is indicated requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential up to the carrying value of goodwill we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

results of impairment tests 

at december 31 2021 the net book value of our goodwill totaled 26332 million as it relates to our 2021 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter we tested all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary based on our testing all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the their respective carrying values there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist we had no goodwill impairment charges in 2021 2020 or 2019 

in 2019 sales and operating performance associated with our krave business were below expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of a strategic review initiated by our leadership team we updated our strategic forecast which projected underperformance related to the krave business primarily due to mainstream brands driving category volume and an increase in the overall competitive landscape we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our krave longlived asset group for impairment based on our assessment we determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset group’s carrying value over its fair value therefore as a result of this testing during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1001 million to write down the longlived asset group which predominantly consisted of customer relationship and trademark intangible assets 



income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions’ net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

in december 2020 our fixedtofloating interest rate swap matured in connection with the repayment of certain longterm debt upon its maturity therefore as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 we had no interest rate swap derivative instruments in a fair value hedging relationship prior to maturing in december 2020 the total notional amount of interest rate swaps was 350 million the notional amount relates to fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variablerate debt through its december 2020 maturity would have increased interest expense by approximately 32 million for 2020 

in addition the total amount of shortterm debt net of cash amounted to net debt of 610 million and net cash of 11 billion respectively at december 31 2021 and 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variablerate shortterm debt as of december 31 2021 would have changed interest expense by approximately 24 million for 2021 and 86 million for 2020 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable rates with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 by approximately 319 million and 357 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 



foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2021 and 2020 the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of 28 million and a liability of 31 million respectively in addition assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 248 million and 256 million respectively generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities 



commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar corn products dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

• commodity market fluctuations 

• foreign currency exchange rates 

• imbalances between supply and demand 

• rising levels of inflation related to domestic and global economic conditions or supply chain issues 

• the effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality 

• speculative influences 

• trade agreements among producing and consuming nations 

• supplier compliance with commitments 

• importexport requirements for raw materials and finished goods 

• political unrest in producing countries 

• introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements and 

• changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies 

we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn products certain dairy products wheat products natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future raw material and energy price fluctuations by using derivatives and forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodity futures markets and therefore it can be difficult to hedge dairy costs for extended periods of time we use diesel fuel futures to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

cocoa products 

during 2021 average cocoa futures contract prices increased 27 compared with 2020 and traded in a narrow range between 104 and 127 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract strong global production growth more than offset a firmer consumption picture with a corresponding increase in global stocks especially in the united states while the global surplus weighed on the price outlook for the first half of 2021 concerns over the next main crop owing to early pod counts and below average rainfall underpinned prices through yearend the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 



sugar 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market the us delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from 045 to 058 per pound during 2021 prices were historically high throughout 2021 due to lack of imports by the us government resulting in an extremely tight domestic raw sugar market 

corn products 

we use corn futures to price our corn sweetener product requirements a strong rebound in ethanol production along with continued strong exports drove prices higher in 2021 corn prices traded in a range from 484 to 732 per bushel during 2021 

dairy products 

during 2021 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 1319 per pound to a high of 1988 per pound on a class iv milk basis fluid dairy milk prices were higher than 2020 driven by declines in us milk production and higher dairy demand 

wheat products 

in 2021 we began utilizing soft and hard wheat futures as a risk management tool for our flour purchasing poor us weather impacted production and resulted in lower stocks and higher prices compared to 2020 hard wheat prices traded in the range of 562 to 884 per bushel during 2021 while soft wheat prices traded in the range of 599 to 867 per bushel during 2021 

peanuts and almonds 

peanut prices in the us ranged from a low of 053 per pound to a high of 055 per pound during 2021 prices rose this year due strong demand and tight supply almond prices began the year at 203 per pound and closed the year at 285 per pound during 2021 persistent drought and concerns over the 2021 almond crop size drove price volatility 

changes in the value of futures contracts 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 3132 million as of december 31 2021 and 2798 million as of december 31 2020 at the end of 2021 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2021 by 348 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2020 approximately 31 of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states us to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse changes in climate or extreme weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe 



cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

our trading company in switzerland performs all aspects of cocoa procurement including price risk management physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight the trading company optimizes the supply chain for our cocoa requirements with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence it also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii and iv dairy products peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain international markets we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service we have also experienced increased competition from other snack items and we are focused on expanding the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions 

working capital seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks the trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the united states and other key international markets where our products are sold we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names 



furthermore we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 



research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries including the us mexico brazil and india we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

we believe our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety various government agencies and thirdparty firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business operating results liquidity and financial condition while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business performance or financial condition in the future 

risk related to macroeconomic conditions 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by the failure to successfully manage a disruption in consumer and trade patterns as well as operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 global pandemic 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels impulse purchases the availability of our products at retail and our ability to manufacture store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact our overall business and financial results specific factors that may impact our operations some of which have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of covid19 include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our products or pantryloading activity if prolonged such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results 

• significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers common carriers or other shippers modifying restocking fulfillment and shipping practices 

• the inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or finished product components transportation resources workforce availability or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• the inability to effectively manage evolving health and welfare strategies including but not limited to ongoing or not yet fully known costs related to operational adjustments to ensure continued employee and consumer safety and adherence to health guidelines as they are modified and supplemented 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer viewing and shopping habits due to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting and entertainment events reduced instore visits travel restrictions and a shift in customer advertising priorities among other things 

• the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may negatively impact our operations or 

• significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently 



staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could negatively impact our results 

with respect to covid19 the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change the companys efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control including the duration and severity of any disease outbreak as well as thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects 

risks related to our business and operations 

our company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging human and workplace rights and other environmental social or governance matters which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers consumers suppliers vendors and employees among others issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation we have in the past and may in the future need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions in addition negative publicity related to our environmental social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers consumers suppliers and vendors 

we have in the past and in the future could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging human and workplace rights and other environmental social or governance matters which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions as well as the potential impact on our reputation or ability to sell our products could negatively affect our operating results 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately 72 of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 

• natural disaster 

• pandemic outbreak of disease 

• climate change and severity of extreme weather 

• fire or explosion 

• terrorism or other acts of violence 

• labor strikes or other labor activities 

• unavailability of raw or packaging materials 

• operational andor financial instability of key suppliers and other vendors or service providers and 

• suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to costeffectively meet product demand 

we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for mitigate or manage operational stability and business resiliency particularly within our international markets and snacks portfolio due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 



we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies 

our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to the industry in which we operate 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar corn products dairy products peanuts almonds natural gas and diesel fuel 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

• commodity market fluctuations 

• currency exchanges rates 

• imbalances between supply and demand 

• the effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality 

• speculative influences 

• trade agreements among producing and consuming nations 

• supplier compliance with commitments 

• importexport requirements for raw materials and finished goods 

• political unrest in producing countries 

• introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements and 

• changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies 

although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging freight direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 



market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 

• effective retail execution 

• appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs 

• our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations 

• our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories 

• changes in product category consumption 

• our response to consumer demographics and trends including but not limited to trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel and 

• consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients 

there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 31 of our total net sales in 2020 mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

risks related to strategic initiatives 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



in 2020 we successfully completed the divestitures of krave and the scharffen berger and dagoba brands as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities additionally over the last several years we have continued to invest in our snacks portfolio specifically with the acquisitions of one brands llc in september 2019 pirate brands in october 2018 and amplify snack brands inc in january 2018 respectively while we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage hersheys resources expertise capabilitybuilding distribution locations and customer base in addition these acquisitions are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key subsegment of the warehouse snack aisle if we are unable to successfully couple hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with one brands pirate brands and amplifys existing operations it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace 

our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we derived approximately 136 158 and 161 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally approximately 20 of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2020 as part of our strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly in canada malaysia mexico brazil and india as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

• the inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption supply constraints inflation deflation or decreased demand 

• the inability to establish develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets 

• difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

• political and economic instability including the possibility of civil unrest terrorism mass violence or armed conflict 

• nationalization of our properties by foreign governments 

• tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

• increased costs disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation 

• the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies 

• failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets and 

• failure to recruit retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce 

if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 



we may not fully realize the expected costs savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs which may have an adverse impact on our business 

we depend on our ability to evolve and grow and as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce to transform our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights if we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain longterm sustainable growth such as the international optimization program which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the margin for growth program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017 and subsequently completed in mid2020 these programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency to reduce our costs andor to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs or that the benefits even if achieved will be adequate to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations which could in turn adversely affect our business 

risks related to governmental and regulatory changes 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws importexport requirements and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions broad political instability rising unemployment pandemic outbreak of disease climate change weather natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 



risks related to digital transformation cybersecurity and data privacy 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industryaccepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business resiliency preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems 

while we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business this in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 

complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp system without experiencing further delays increased costs and other difficulties we selectively paused certain aspects of the erp system implementation due to resource constraints and challenges associated with the critical design phase during these uncertain times we expect this to delay our overall erp implementation by approximately one year if we are unable to successfully design and implement the new erp system as planned our financial positions results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the erp system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed

trends affecting our business 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization designated the novel coronavirus covid19 as a global pandemic covid19 was first detected in wuhan city hubei province china and continued to spread significantly impacting various markets around the world including the us various policies and initiatives have been implemented to reduce the global transmission of covid19 

local state and national governments continue to emphasize the importance of food supply during this pandemic and asked that food manufacturers and retailers remain open to meet the needs of our communities employee safety is our first priority and as a result we put preparedness plans in place at our manufacturing facilities our manufacturing facilities are currently open however we have adjusted shift schedules enforced social distancing increased sanitation and adjusted time and attendance policies for worker absenteeism our sales teams continue to support community food supplies while adhering to social distancing guidelines implementing flexible hours reducing persontoperson interaction and increasing safety measures at the onset of the pandemic the company temporarily closed all hersheys chocolate world stores in the us 3 locations niagara falls ontario and singapore however since july all locations were reopened on a limited capacity basis with increased safety measures and enforced social distancing 

in june we commenced a phased in approach to reopen our corporate headquarters in hershey pennsylvania and other select offices with increased safety protocols we have successfully onboarded several teams however occupancy levels remain low as we continue to monitor the latest covid19 related public health and government guidance as a result a majority of our officebased employees continue to work remotely where possible we have crisis management teams in place to monitor the continually evolving situation and recommending risk mitigation actions as deemed necessary to date there has been minimal disruption to our supply chain network including the supply of our ingredients packaging or other sourced materials though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if the covid19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world we are also working closely with our business units contract manufacturers distributors contractors and other external business partners to minimize the potential impact on our business 

we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs however we continue to evaluate and take action as necessary to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can continue to operate during these uncertain times our most recent liquidity measures include the 1 billion notes issuance in may 2020 with varying rates ranging from 0900 to 2650 and maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2050 additionally we continue to limit discretionary spending across the organization and reprioritize our capital projects amid the covid19 pandemic we plan to move forward with our new global erp system implementation and supply chain capacity projects as these investments are of strategic importance to our longterm growth however as previously announced we did selectively pause certain aspects of the erp system implementation due to resource constraints and challenges associated with the critical design phase during these uncertain times we expect this to delay our overall erp implementation by approximately one year 

in late may and early june many state governments began a phased reopening of their economies these phased approaches promoted limited food service offerings outdoor dining increased travel and the reopening of retailing establishments while imposing new guidelines and enhanced safety measures including social distancing and face mask protocols as a result we experienced an increase in our net sales and income during 2020 unfavorable impacts from covid19 were primarily limited to our international and other segment see segment results included in this mda we believe the financial impacts from covid19 are temporary in nature and do not significantly affect our business model and growth strategy 

while recent reopening approaches have made a shortterm positive impact on local and state economies and the us unemployment rate certain states have modified reopening plans as new cases of covid19 have led to new trends in outbreaks and hotspots based on the length and severity of covid19 including the distribution of vaccinations we may experience continued volatility in retail foot traffic consumer shopping and consumption behavior we will 



continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business consolidated results of operations segment results liquidity and capital resources

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial amounts of cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

cash provided by operating activities in 2020 decreased 643 million relative to 2019 this decrease was driven by the following factors 

• net working capital comprised of trade accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities consumed cash of 166 million in 2020 and generated cash of 60 million in 2019 this 226 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a higher yearoveryear build up of us inventories to satisfy product requirements and maintain sufficient levels to accommodate customer requirements as well as an increase in cash used by accounts receivable due to an increase in sales of us seasonal products 

• the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash inflows 

◦ net income adjusted for noncash charges to operations including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes longlived and intangible asset charges writedown of equity investments and other charges resulted in 207 million of higher cash flow in 2020 relative to 2019 



cash provided by operating activities in 2019 increased 1640 million relative to 2018 this increase was driven by the following factors 

• net working capital comprised of trade accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated cash of 60 million in 2019 and consumed cash of 104 million in 2018 this 164 million fluctuation was mainly driven by higher cash receipts prior to yearend 2019 the timing of vendor and supplier payments as well as higher accrued incentive compensation related to annual performance that was paid in the first quarter of 2020 

• prepaid expenses and other current assets generated cash of 14 million in 2019 compared to a use of cash of 40 million in 2018 this 54 million fluctuation was mainly driven by the timing of payments on commodity futures in addition in 2019 the volume of commodity futures held which require margin deposits was lower compared to 2018 we utilize commodity futures contracts to economically manage the risk of future price fluctuations associated with our purchase of raw materials 

• the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash outflows 

◦ income taxes used cash of 9 million in 2019 compared to cash generated of 76 million in 2018 this 85 million fluctuation was mainly due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2019 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments which resulted in a lower taxes payable position at the end of 2019 compared to 2018 

◦ net income adjusted for noncash charges to operations including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes longlived and intangible asset charges writedown of equity investments and other charges resulted in 2 million of lower cash flow in 2019 relative to 2018 

pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 345 million 414 million and 421 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 117 million 201 million and 259 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

• investments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits  we make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits we invested approximately 872 million in 2020 802 million in 2019 and 526 million in 2018 in projects qualifying for tax credits 

• other investing activities  in 2020 and 2019 we made minority investments in emerging snacking businesses that qualify as cost method investments 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options financing activities in 2020 used cash by 4992 million compared to cash used of 10814 million in 2019 we generated cash of 1161 million for financing activities in 2018 primarily to fund acquisition activity 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 

• shortterm borrowings net in addition to utilizing cash on hand we use shortterm borrowings commercial paper and bank borrowings to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs in 2020 we generated cash flow of 418 million due to an increase in shortterm foreign bank borrowings in 2019 we used 12 billion to reduce shortterm commercial paper borrowings and shortterm foreign borrowings we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in october 2019 to repay outstanding commercial paper used to fund the one brands acquisition in 2018 we generated cash flow of 6458 million through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper partially offset by a reduction in shortterm foreign bank borrowings we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the amplify acquisition and repay amplifys outstanding debt owed under its existing credit agreement a portion of the commercial paper borrowings used to fund the amplify acquisition were subsequently refinanced with the proceeds of new notes issued during the second quarter of 2018 as discussed below 

• longterm debt borrowings and repayments  in may 2020 we issued 300 million of 0900 notes due in 2025 350 million of 1700 notes due in 2030 and 350 million of 2650 notes due in 2050 the 2020 notes proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 notes net of discounts and issuance costs totaled 9899 million additionally in may 2020 and december 2020 we repaid 350 million of 2900 notes and 350 million of 4125 notes due upon their maturities in october 2019 we issued 300 million of 205 notes due in 2024 300 million of 245 notes due in 2029 and 400 million of 3125 notes due in 2049 the 2019 notes proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 notes net of discounts and issuance costs totaled 9903 million in may 2018 we issued 350 million of 290 notes due in 2020 350 million of 310 notes due in 2021 and 500 



million of 3375 notes due in 2023 the 2018 notes proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 notes net of discounts and issuance costs totaled 11938 million in 2018 we repaid 300 million of 160 notes due upon their maturity additionally in august 2018 we repaid a portion of the commercial paper borrowings that had been used to fund the amplify acquisition 

• tax receivable obligation  in connection with the amplify acquisition the company agreed to make payments to the counterparty of a tax receivable agreement in 2018 we paid 720 million to settle the tax receivable obligation 

• share repurchases  we repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans the value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price in addition we periodically repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to boardauthorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value in 2020 we used cash for total share repurchases of 2112 million that included purchases pursuant to authorized programs this included 1500 million to purchase 10 million shares in 2019 we used cash for total share repurchases of 5272 million that included purchases pursuant to authorized programs this included 1500 million to purchase 14 million shares in 2018 we used cash for total share repurchases of 2475 million which included a privately negotiated repurchase transaction with hershey trust company as trustee for the trust to purchase 450 thousand shares for 478 million in october 2017 our board of directors approved a 100 million share repurchase authorization this program was completed in the first quarter of 2019 in july 2018 our board of directors approved an additional 500 million share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2020 approximately 260 million remained available for repurchases of our common stock under this program the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date we expect 2021 share repurchases to return to a more traditional buyback strategy 

• dividend payments  total dividend payments to holders of our common stock and class b common stock were 6407 million in 2020 6103 million in 2019 and 5625 million in 2018 dividends per share of common stock increased 55 to 3154 per share in 2020 compared to 2990 per share in 2019 while dividends per share of class b common stock increased 55 in 2020 details regarding our 2020 cash dividends paid to stockholders are as follows 



• proceeds from the exercise of stock options including tax benefits we received 255 million from employee exercises of stock options net of employee taxes withheld from sharebased awards in 2020 we received 2408 million and 633 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant 



financial condition 

at december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 11 billion at december 31 2019 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 4933 million our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2020 increased 6507 million compared to the 2019 yearend balance this increase was predominantly due to our 1 billion 2020 notes issuance in may 2020 as we intend to mitigate any potential covid19 risks partially offset by the repayment of 350 million notes that matured in may 2020 and 350 million notes that matured in december 2020 additional detail regarding the net sources of cash are outlined in the following discussion 

approximately 35 of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states during 2020 previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested however the company had previously recognized a onetime us repatriation tax due under us tax reform and as a result only an immaterial amount of withholding tax was recognized for the remainder of the company’s cash held by international subsidiaries we intend to continue to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 46 billion at december 31 2020 and 43 billion at december 31 2019 our total debt increased in 2020 mainly due to our 1 billion 2020 notes issuance in may 2020 partially offset by the repayment of 350 million notes that matured in may 2020 and 350 million notes that matured in december 2020 

as a source of shortterm financing we maintain a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional 500 million with the consent of the lenders as of december 31 2020 the termination date of this agreement is july 2 2024 however we may extend the termination date for up to two additional oneyear periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions as of december 31 2020 we had 15 billion of available capacity under the agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2020 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2020 we had available capacity of 193 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 



equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the trust established by milton s and catherine s hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition three representatives of hershey trust company currently serve as members of the companys board in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the trust in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company the companys board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company as trustee for the trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with longterm notes 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments including imputed interest under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities 

3 includes the minimum rental commitments including imputed interest under noncancelable finance leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities as well as vehicles 

4 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic 



pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

5 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2020 the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2020 nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

• accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

• pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

• business acquisitions valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

• income taxes 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered 



historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant during 2020 2019 and 2018 actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 2 our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled 1956 million and 1810 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations our related accounting policies accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

• longterm rate of return on plan assets  the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis we consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the longterm rate of return including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the longterm rate of return and the actual return realized for 2020 we decreased the expected return on plan assets assumption to 48 from the 53 assumption used during 2019 the historical average return compounded annually over the 20 years prior to december 31 2020 was approximately 60 

as of december 31 2020 our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 281 million we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount which is the greater of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the expected longterm rate of investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the longterm rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 10 million 

• discount rate  prior to december 31 2017 the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost were determined utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations beginning in 2018 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve this change does not affect the measurement of our pension and 



other postretirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping which was the case in 2018 we accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly accounted for it on a prospective basis starting in 2018 

a 100 basis point decrease increase in the weightedaverage pension discount rate would increase decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 7 million and the december 31 2020 pension liability would increase by approximately 108 million or decrease by approximately 91 million respectively 

pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately 6 million in 2021 pension expense beyond 2021 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postemployment benefit plans 

changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

• discount rate  the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations of the opeb plans is discussed in the pension plans section above a 100 basis point decrease increase in the discount rate assumption for these plans would not be material to the opeb plans consolidated expense and the december 31 2020 benefit liability would increase by approximately 27 million or decrease by approximately 22 million respectively 

business acquisitions valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

we use the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions under the acquisition method the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and companyspecific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is indicated requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential up to the carrying value of goodwill we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount 



rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

results of impairment tests 

at december 31 2020 the net book value of our goodwill totaled 19882 million as it relates to our 2020 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter we tested one reporting unit using a quantitative assessment we tested our remaining reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary based on our testing all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the their respective carrying values there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist we had no goodwill impairment charges in 2020 2019 or 2018 

in 2019 sales and operating performance associated with our krave business were below expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of a strategic review initiated by our leadership team we updated our strategic forecast which projected underperformance related to the krave business primarily due to mainstream brands driving category volume and an increase in the overall competitive landscape we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our krave longlived asset group for impairment based on our assessment we determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value therefore as a result of this testing during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1001 million to write down the longlived asset group which predominantly consisted of customer relationship and trademark intangible assets 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us 



capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

in december 2020 our fixedtofloating interest rate swap matured in connection with the repayment of certain longterm debt upon its maturity therefore as of december 31 2020 we had no interest rate swap derivative instruments in a fair value hedging relationship the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2019 was 350 million the notional amount relates to fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2019 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variablerate debt through its december 2020 maturity would have increased interest expense by approximately 32 million for the year 2020 and 35 million for the full year 2019 

in addition the total amount of shortterm debt net of cash amounted to net cash of 11 billion and 461 million respectively at december 31 2020 and 2019 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variablerate shortterm debt as of december 31 2020 would have changed interest expense by approximately 86 million for the full year 2020 and 43 million for the full year 2019 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable rates with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 by approximately 357 million and 246 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 



foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value of these instruments was a liability of 31 million and an asset of 10 million respectively in addition assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 256 million and 554 million respectively generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities 



commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar corn products dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

• commodity market fluctuations 

• foreign currency exchange rates 

• imbalances between supply and demand 

• the effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality 

• speculative influences 

• trade agreements among producing and consuming nations 

• supplier compliance with commitments 

• importexport requirements for raw materials and finished goods 

• political unrest in producing countries 

• introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements and 

• changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies 

we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn products certain dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future raw material and energy price fluctuations by using derivatives and forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodity futures markets and therefore it can be difficult to hedge dairy costs for extended periods of time we use diesel fuel futures to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

cocoa products 

during 2020 average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2019 and traded in a range between 100 and 129 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract while global production declined slightly demand reduced to a greater extent leading to a modest global surplus and accompanying increase in overall stocks during the first half of the year prices declined amidst an expectation of strong future supply and concerns around the demand outlook strong west african production remains the consensus though the demand picture has been unclear given broadbased quarantine measures the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 



sugar 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market the us delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from 4400 to 4900 per pound during 2020 prices were historically high throughout 2020 due to poor beet and cane sugar production in 2019 for all of north america 

corn products

changes in the value of futures contracts 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 2798 million as of december 31 2020 and 5897 million as of december 31 2019 at the end of 2020 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2020 by 274 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 1 

products and brands 

our principal product offerings include chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery products gum and mint refreshment products snack items such as popcorn protein bars and cookies spreads bars and snack bitesmixes and meat snacks and pantry items such as baking ingredients toppings and beverages 

 principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2019  approximately 30 of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 2 

our trading company in switzerland performs all aspects of cocoa procurement including price risk management physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight the trading company was implemented to optimize the supply chain for our cocoa requirements with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence it also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii and iv dairy products peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service we have also experienced increased competition from other snack items which we are focused on expanding the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions 

working capital seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis

our company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging human and workplace rights and other environmental social or governance matters which in turn could negatively impact our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers consumers suppliers vendors and employees among others issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption and we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages in addition negative publicity related to our environmental social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers consumers suppliers and vendors costs associated with these potential actions as well as the potential impact on our ability to sell our products could negatively affect our operating results 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 6 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar corn products dairy products peanuts almonds natural gas and diesel fuel 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

 

although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging freight direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 

 

there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 30 of our total net sales in 2019  mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 7 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately 70 of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 

 

we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we completed the acquisitions of one brands llc in september 2019 pirate brands in october 2018 and amplify snack brands inc in january 2018 respectively while we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage hersheys resources expertise capabilitybuilding distribution locations and customer base in addition these acquisitions are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key subsegment of the warehouse snack aisle if we are unable to successfully couple hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with one brands pirate brands and amplifys existing operations it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 8 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws importexport requirements and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions broad political instability rising unemployment pandemic outbreak of disease weather natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively we derived approximately 16  16 and 17 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally approximately 20 of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2019  as part of our strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly in canada china malaysia mexico brazil and india as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 9 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business this in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 

we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies 

our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 10 

we may not fully realize the expected costs savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs which may have an adverse impact on our business 

we depend on our ability to evolve and grow and as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce to transform our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights if we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain longterm sustainable growth such as the margin for growth program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017 these programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency to reduce our costs andor to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs or that the benefits even if achieved will be adequate to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations which could in turn adversely affect our business 

complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp system without experiencing delays increased costs and other difficulties if we are unable to successfully design and implement the new erp system as planned our financial positions results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the erp system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed

at december 31 2019  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 4933 million at december 31 2018  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 5880 million our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2019 decreased 947 million compared to the 2018 yearend balance as a result of the uses of net cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately 60 of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states the company recognized the onetime us repatriation tax due under us tax reform and as a result repatriation of these amounts would not be subject to additional us federal income tax but would be subject to applicable withholding taxes in the relevant jurisdiction our intent is to reinvest funds earned outside of the united states to finance foreign operations and investments and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 43 billion at december 31 2019 and 45 billion at december 31 2018  our total debt decreased in 2019 mainly due to the repayment of commercial paper borrowings used to fund the one brands acquisition partially offset by additional notes issued in october 2019 

as a source of shortterm financing we maintain a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional 500 million with the consent of the lenders as of december 31 2019  the termination date of this agreement is july 2 2024 however we may extend the termination date for up to two additional oneyear periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility we may use these funds for 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 30 

general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions as of december 31 2019  we had 15 billion of available capacity under the agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2019  

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2019  we had available capacity of 358 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the trust established by milton s and catherine s hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition three representatives of hershey trust company currently serve as members of the companys board in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the trust in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company the companys board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company as trustee for the trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019  



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with longterm notes 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments including inputed interest under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities 

3 includes the minimum rental commitments including inputed interest under noncancelable finance leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities as well as vehicles 

4 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

5 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2019  the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2019  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 32 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant during 2019  2018  and 2017  actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3  our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled 1810 million and 1714 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations our related accounting policies accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 33 

pension plans 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

 

as of december 31 2019 our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 296 million we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount which is the greater of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the expected longterm rate of investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the longterm rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 9 million 

 

a 100 basis point decrease increase in the weightedaverage pension discount rate would increase decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 5 million and the december 31 2019 pension liability would increase by approximately 103 million or decrease by approximately 87 million respectively 

pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately 16 million in 2020 pension expense beyond 2020 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postemployment benefit plans 

changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations

business acquisitions valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

we use the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions under the acquisition method the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and companyspecific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is indicated requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential up to the carrying value of goodwill we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

results of impairment tests 

at december 31 2019  the net book value of our goodwill totaled 19860 million as it relates to our 2019 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter we tested all reporting units using a quantitative assessment based on our testing all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the their respective carrying values there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist we had no goodwill impairment charges in 2019 2018 or 2017 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 35 

in 2019 sales and operating performance associated with our krave pure foods inc “krave” business were below expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of a strategic review initiated by our leadership team we updated our strategic forecast which projected under performance related to the krave business primarily due to mainstream brands driving category volume and an increase in the overall competitive landscape we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our krave longlived asset group for impairment based on our assessment we determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value therefore as a result of this testing during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1001 million to write down the longlived asset group which predominantly consisted of customer relationship and trademark intangible assets 

in february 2017 we commenced the margin for growth program which includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china longlived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset groups longlived assets therefore as a result of this testing during the first quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1059 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 350 million the notional amount relates to fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2019 and 2018 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this now variablerate debt as of december 31 2019 would have increased interest expense by approximately 35 million for the full year 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in addition the total amount of shortterm debt net of cash amounted to net cash of 461 million and net shortterm debt of 610 million respectively at december 31 2019 and 2018  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variablerate shortterm debt as of december 31 2019 would have increased interest expense by approximately 43 million for the full year 2019 and 90 million for the full year 2018 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable rates with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 by approximately 246 million and 121 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 37 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2019 and 2018  the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of 10 million and an asset of 25 million respectively in addition assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 554 million and 45 million respectively generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar corn products dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn products certain dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future raw material and energy price fluctuations by using derivatives and forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodity futures markets and therefore it can be difficult to hedge dairy costs for extended periods of time we use diesel fuel futures to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

cocoa products 

during 2019 average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with 2018 and traded in a range between 090 and 114 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract cocoa production was higher during the 2018 to 2019 crop year but was slightly outpaced by the increase in global demand which led to a small reduction in global cocoa stocks over the past year at the beginning of the year cocoa prices declined due to higher production in west africa before rallying in the second half due to sustained consumption the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the hershey company  2019 form 10k  page 39 

sugar 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the united states are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market united states delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from 040 to 047 per pound during 2019 prices rallied in late 2019 due to a poor sugar beet harvest in the upper midwest and west 

corn products 

we uses corn futures to price our corn sweetener product requirements excessive spring rains caused late plantings which resulted in lower yields compared to a record crop in 2018 corn prices traded in a range from 352 to 473 per bushel during 2019 

dairy products 

during 2019 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 015 per pound to a high of 017 per pound on a class iv milk basis fluid dairy milk prices were higher than 2018 driven by declines in us milk production 

peanuts and almonds 

peanut prices in the united states ranged from a low of 045 per pound to a high of 055 per pound adverse weather conditions in the southeast us during the end of the growing season have resulted in lower quality and higher prices almond prices began the year at 299 per pound and closed the year at 339 per pound driven by strong shipments and lower than expected yields for the 2019 crop 

changes in the value of futures contracts 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 5897 million as of december 31 2019 and 6935 million as of december 31 2018 at the end of 2019 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2019 by 586 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of december 31 2019  based on that evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2019  

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system which will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years we have completed the implementation of certain processes including our consolidated financial reporting platform in the second quarter of 2018 as well as our trade promotions and direct marketing systems in the first quarter of 2019 these transitions did not result in significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting however as the next phases of the updated processes are rolled out in connection with the erp implementation we will give appropriate consideration to whether these process changes necessitate changes in the design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting 

design and evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 

disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

managements report on the companys internal control over financial reporting appears on the following page there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019  in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control–integrated framework 2013 edition  based on this assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2019  the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of one brands llc which was acquired on september 23 2019 and is included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted 51 of total assets as of december 31 2019 and 03 of net sales for the year then ended 

the company’s independent auditors have audited and reported on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019

reportable segments 

our organizational structure is designed to ensure continued focus on north america coupled with an emphasis on profitable growth in our focus international markets our business is organized around geographic regions which enables us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets as a result we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis as this aligns with how our chief operating decision maker “codm” manages our business including resource allocation and performance assessment our north america business which generates approximately 89 of our consolidated revenue is our only reportable segment none of our other operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments therefore these operating segments are combined and disclosed below as international and other 

 financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

business acquisitions 

in october 2018 we completed the acquisition of pirate brands which includes the pirates booty  smart puffs and original tings brands from bg foods inc pirate brands offers baked trans fat free and gluten free snacks and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the united states 

in january 2018 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of amplify snack brands inc amplify a publicly traded company based in austin texas that owns several popular betterforyou snack brands such as skinnypop  oatmega and paqui  the acquisition enables us to capture more consumer snacking occasions by creating a broader portfolio of brands 

in april 2016 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ripple brand collective llc a privately held company based in congers new york that owns the barkthins mass premium chocolate snacking brand the acquisition was undertaken in order to broaden our product offerings in the premium and portable snacking categories 

products and brands 

our principal product offerings include chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery products gum and mint refreshment products pantry items such as baking ingredients toppings and beverages and snack items such as spreads meat snacks bars and snack bites and mixes popcorn and protein bars and cookies 

 principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2018  approximately 28 of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

in 2016 we established a trading company in switzerland that performs all aspects of cocoa procurement including price risk management physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight the trading company was implemented to optimize the supply chain for our cocoa requirements with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence it also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii and iv dairy products peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service in recent years we have also experienced increased competition from other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth 

working capital seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks the trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the united states and other key international markets where our products are sold we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names 

furthermore we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 



research and development

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of commerce and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the united states 

we believe our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety various government agencies and thirdparty firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations 

beyond ordinary course operating and capital expenditures we make to comply with environmental laws and regulations we have made a number of commitments to protect and reduce our impact on the environment in recent years including efforts to protect forests and forested habitats and reduce emissions across our supply chain the annual operating and capital expenditures associated with these ordinary course payments and additional commitments are not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging freight direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 28 of our total net sales in 2018  mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately 71 of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 



we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we completed the acquisitions of amplify snack brands inc and pirate brands in january 2018 and october 2018 respectively while we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage hersheys resources expertise capabilitybuilding distribution locations and customer base in addition the acquisitions of amplify and pirate brands are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key subsegment of the warehouse snack aisle if we are unable to successfully couple hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with amplify and pirate brands existing operations it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions broad political instability rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively we derived approximately 16  17 and 17 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally approximately 22 of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2018  as part of our strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly in canada china malaysia mexico brazil and india as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business this in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 

we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies 

our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we may not fully realize the expected costs savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs which may have an adverse impact on our business 

we depend on our ability to evolve and grow and as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce to transform our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights if we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain longterm sustainable growth such as the margin for growth program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017 these programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency to reduce our costs andor to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business we cannot guarantee that we will 

be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs or that the benefits even if achieved will be adequate to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations which could in turn adversely affect our business 

complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp system without experiencing delays increased costs and other difficulties if we are unable to successfully design and implement the new erp system as planned our financial positions results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the erp system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed

nongaap information 

comparability of certain financial measures 

the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated marktomarket gains losses on commodity derivatives pension settlement charges relating to companydirected initiatives costs associated with business realignment activities costs relating to the integration of acquisitions impairment of longlived assets the onetime impact of us tax reform the gain realized on the sale of a trademark and the gain recorded upon settlement of a liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares of shanghai golden monkey food joint stock co ltd sgm 

to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance we use nongaap financial measures within mda that exclude the financial impact of these activities these nongaap financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures referenced in mda to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below 

explanatory note 

in conjunction with the adoption of asu 201707 compensationretirement benefits topic 715  in the first quarter of 2018 the company elected to discontinue its practice of excluding the nonservice related components of its net periodic benefit cost in deriving its nongaap financial measures with a minor exception historically the company excluded from its nongaap results the following components relating to its pension benefit plans interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of net loss gain and settlement and curtailment charges the company did not historically exclude from its nongaap results the nonservice related components relating to its other post retirement benefit plans starting with the first quarter of 2018 the company will continue to exclude from its nongaap results the portion of pension settlement andor curtailment charges relating to companydirected initiatives such as significant business realignment events and benefit plan terminations or amendments as a result of this change the nongaap reconciliations presented for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 that follow have been revised to conform to this updated presentation the revision in the company’s determination of nongaap earnings resulted in a reduction of 007 to adjusted earnings per sharediluted from 476 to 469 for 2017 and a reduction of 008 to adjusted earnings per sharediluted from 441 to 433 for 2016  





 the tax effect for each adjustment is determined by calculating the tax impact of the adjustment on the companys quarterly effective tax rate 

in the assessment of our results we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the reported and nongaap financial measures presented above 



 

details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the nongaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows 

marktomarket gains losses on commodity derivatives 

the marktomarket gains losses on commodity derivatives are recorded as unallocated and excluded from adjusted results until such time as the related inventory is sold at which time the corresponding gains losses are reclassified from unallocated to segment income since we often purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years we make this adjustment to facilitate the yearoveryear comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged for the period for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 the net adjustment recognized within unallocated was a gain of 1683 million  a gain of 353 million and a loss of 1632 million  respectively see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information

we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance longterm profitability for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we incurred 518 million  694 million and 939 million  respectively of pretax costs related to business realignment activities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

acquisitionrelated costs 

for the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred expenses totaling 448 million related to the acquisitions of amplify and pirate brands this primarily includes legal and consultant fees as well as severance and other costs relating to the integration of the businesses for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we incurred expenses totaling 03 million and 65 million  respectively related to integration of the 2016 acquisition of ripple brand collective llc as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and information systems 

pension settlement charges related to companydirected initiatives 

in 2018 settlement charges in our hourly defined benefit plan were triggered by lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company under a voluntary separation plan included within the operational optimization program as defined below in 2017 settlement charges were triggered in the pension plan benefiting our employees in puerto rico as a result of lump sum distributions and the purchase of annuity contracts relating to the termination of this plan in 2016 settlement charges in our hourly defined benefit plan were triggered by lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company under a voluntary separation plan included within the 2015 productivity initiative as defined below 

longlived and intangible asset impairment charges 

for the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred 577 million of pretax longlived asset impairment charges to adjust the longlived asset values of certain disposal groups including the sgm and tyrrells businesses the lotte shanghai foods co ltd joint venture and other assets these charges represent the excess of the disposal groups carrying values including the related currency translation adjustment amounts realized or to be realized upon completion of the sales over the sales values less costs to sell for the respective businesses the fair values of the disposal groups were supported by the sales prices paid by thirdparty buyers or estimated sales prices based on marketing of the disposal group when the sale has not yet been completed for the year ended december 31 2017 we incurred 2087 million of pretax longlived asset impairment charges related to certain business realignment activities this included a writedown of certain intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and a writedown of property plant and equipment for the year ended december 31 2016 in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing of other indefinite lived assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india 

impact of us tax reform 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded a net benefit of 78 million as a measurement period adjustment to the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of nonus subsidiaries recorded in connection with the enactment of us tax reform in december 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a net charge of 325 million which included the estimated impact of the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of nonus subsidiaries offset in part by the benefit from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate 

noncontrolling interest share of business realignment and impairment charges 

certain of the business realignment and impairment charges recorded in connection with the margin for growth program related to lotte shanghai foods co ltd a joint venture in which we own a 50 controlling interest therefore we have also adjusted for the portion of these charges included within the loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest 

settlement of sgm liability 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached an agreement with the sgm selling shareholders to reduce the originallyagreed purchase price for the remaining 20 of sgm and we completed the purchase on february 3 2016 in the first quarter of 2016 we recorded a 267 million gain relating to the settlement of the sgm liability representing the net carrying amount of the recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares 

gain on sale of licensing rights 

during the second quarter of 2018 we recorded a 27 million gain on the sale of licensing rights for a noncore trademark relating to a brand marketed outside of the us 

constant currency net sales growth 

we present certain percentage changes in net sales on a constant currency basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange this measure is used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

to present this information for historical periods current period net sales for entities reporting in other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rates in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 

the following tables set forth a reconciliation between reported and constant currency growth rates for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  





consolidated results of operations 



net sales 

2018 compared with 2017 

net sales increased 37 in 2018 compared with 2017  reflecting a benefit from the recent amplify and pirate brands acquisitions of 36 and a volume increase of 13 partially offset by unfavorable price realization of 10 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 02 excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates our net sales increased 39 consolidated volumes increased due to the acquisitions of amplify and pirate brands as well as solid performance in select international markets which more than offset the volume reduction resulting from the sale of sgm in july 2018 the net increase in volume was partially offset by unfavorable net price realization which was primarily attributed to incremental trade promotional expense in the north america segment in support of 2018 programming 

2017 compared with 2016 

net sales increased 10 in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting favorable price realization of 07 a benefit from acquisitions of 03 and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 02 partially offset by a volume decrease of 02 excluding foreign currency our net sales increased 08 in 2017 the favorable net price realization was attributed to lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the north america and international and other segments versus the prior year consolidated volume decreased as a result of lower sales volume in the international and other segment primarily attributed to our china business and the softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings these volume decreases were partially offset by 

higher sales volume in north america specifically from 2017 innovation and new launches including hersheys cookie layer crunch  hersheys gold and hersheys and reeses popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels 

key us marketplace metrics 

for the full year 2018 our total us retail takeaway including amplify increased 03 in the expanded multioutlet combined plus convenience store channels iri mulo  cstores which includes candy mint gum salty snacks snack bars meat snacks and grocery items our us candy mint and gum cmg consumer takeaway was in line with prior year resulting in a cmg market share loss of approximately 36 basis points due to the timing of innovation and promotional activity relative to our competitors 

the cmg consumer takeaway and market share information reflect measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution primarily include food drug mass merchandisers and convenience store channels plus walmart stores inc partial dollar club and military channels these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by information resources incorporated iri the companys market insights and analytics provider and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2018 compared with 2017 

cost of sales increased 38 in 2018 compared with 2017  the increase was driven by higher sales volume higher freight and logistics costs and additional plant costs these drivers were partially offset by an incremental 1251 million favorable impact from markingtomarket our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years commodity purchases and supply chain productivity 

gross margin decreased by 10 basis points in 2018 compared with 2017  the decrease was primarily due to the higher freight and logistics costs unfavorable product mix additional plant costs related to new production lines and incremental trade promotional expense these factors were partially offset by the favorable yearoveryear marktomarket impact from commodity derivative instruments and supply chain productivity 

2017 compared with 2016 

cost of sales decreased 49 in 2017 compared with 2016 the reduction was driven by lower commodity costs coupled with an incremental 1160 million favorable impact from markingtomarket our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years commodity purchases a 530 million decrease in business realignment costs and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives these benefits were offset in part by higher freight and warehousing costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances 

gross margin increased by 340 basis points in 2017 compared with 2016 lower commodity costs coupled with the favorable yearoveryear marktomarket impact from commodity derivative instruments lower business realignment costs and supply chain productivity contributed to the improvement in gross margin however higher supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix partially offset the increase in gross margin 

selling marketing and administrative 

2018 compared with 2017 

selling marketing and administrative “sma” expenses decreased 107 million or 06 in 2018  total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses declined 109 due mainly to spend optimization and shifts relating to our emerging brands as well as reductions in agency and production fees selling marketing and administrative expenses excluding advertising and related consumer marketing increased approximately 62 in 2018 due to incremental expenses from amplify and pirate brands and higher expenses related to the multiyear implementation of our enterprise resource planning system which more than offset reductions in our base spending from the margin for growth program 

2017 compared with 2016 

sma expenses decreased 58 million or 03 in 2017 advertising and related consumer marketing expense remaining consistent with 2016 levels as higher spending by the north america segment was offset by reduced spending by the international and other segment while 2017 sma benefited from costs savings and efficiency initiatives lower business realignment costs and lower acquisition integration costs these savings were offset in part by higher costs related to acquisition due diligence activities and the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system 

longlived and intangible asset impairment charges 

in 2018 we recorded impairment charges totaling 577 million to adjust the longlived asset values within certain disposal groups including the sgm and tyrrells businesses the lotte shanghai foods co ltd joint venture and other assets these charges represent the excess of the disposal groups carrying values including the related currency translation adjustment amounts realized or to be realized upon completion of the sales over the sales values less costs to sell for the respective businesses the fair values of the disposal groups were supported by the sales prices paid by thirdparty buyers or estimated sales prices based on marketing of the disposal group when the sale has not yet been completed the sales of sgm and tyrrells were both completed in july 2018 

in 2017 in connection with the margin for growth program and our initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business we tested our china longlived asset group for impairment our assessment indicated that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable and as a result the impairment loss was allocated to the asset groups longlived assets we recorded longlived asset impairment charges totaling 1060 million to writedown distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and wrotedown property plant and equipment by 1027 million 

in 2016 in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india 

the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

business realignment activities 

we are currently pursuing several business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind key growth strategies costs recorded for business realignment activities during 2018  2017 and 2016 are as follows 

costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our consolidated statements of income as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

margin for growth program 

in the first quarter 2017 the companys board of directors board unanimously approved several initiatives under a single program designed to drive continued net sales operating income and earnings pershare diluted growth over the next several years this program is focused on improving global efficiency and effectiveness optimizing the company’s supply chain streamlining the company’s operating model and reducing administrative expenses to generate longterm savings 

we originally estimated that the margin for growth program would result in total pretax charges of 375 million to 425 million  to be incurred from 2017 to 2019 the majority of the initiatives relating to the program have been executed with the final initiatives to be completed over approximately the next nine months to date we have incurred pretax charges to execute the program totaling 336 million  this includes longlived asset impairment charges of 209 million related to the operations supporting our china business as noted below as well as the 16 million incremental impairment charge resulting from the sale of sgm see note 7 in addition to the impairment charges we have incurred employee separation costs of 48 million and other business realignment costs of 63 million  we expect the remaining spending on this program to be minimal in 2019 bringing total estimated project costs to approximately 340 million to 355 million  the cash portion of the total program charges is estimated to be 97 million to 110 million  the company reduced its global workforce by approximately 15 as a result of this program with a majority of the reductions coming from hourly headcount positions outside of the united states 

during 2018 we recognized total costs associated with the margin for growth program of 55 million  these charges included employee severance largely relating to initiatives to improve the cost structure of our china business and to further streamline our corporate operating model as well as noncash assetrelated incremental depreciation expense as part of optimizing the global supply chain in addition we incurred other program costs which relate primarily to thirdparty charges in support of our initiative to improve global efficiency and effectiveness during 2017 we recognized total costs associated with the margin for growth program of 56 million  the 2017 charges are consistent in nature to the 2018 activity 

the program included an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business when the program was approved in 2017 we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china longlived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset groups longlived assets therefore as a result of this testing during the first quarter of 2017 we recorded impairment charges totaling 209 million  with 106 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and 103 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to property plant and equipment these impairment charges are recorded in the longlived asset impairment charges caption within the consolidated statements of operations 

operational optimization program 

in the second quarter of 2016 we commenced a program the “operational optimization program” to optimize our production and supply chain network which included select facility consolidations the program encompassed the transition of our china chocolate and sgm operations into a united golden hershey platform including the integration of the china sales force as well as workforce planning efforts and the consolidation of production within certain facilities in china and north america 

during 2018 we incurred pretax costs totaling 3 million  relating primarily to thirdparty charges in support of our initiative to optimize our production and supply chain network in addition we completed the sale of select china facilities in 2018 that had been taken out of service in connection with the operational optimization program resulting in a gain of 7 million  during 2017 and 2016 we incurred pretax costs totaling 14 million and 88 million respectively including noncash assetrelated incremental depreciation costs in 2016 employee related costs costs to consolidate and relocate production and third party costs incurred to execute these activities this program was completed in 2018 

2015 productivity initiative 

in mid2015 we initiated a productivity initiative the “2015 productivity initiative” intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer to enable a more enterprisewide approach to innovation to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda and to provide for a more efficient cost structure while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas overall the 2015 productivity initiative was undertaken to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the companys ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer 

the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2015 resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300 positions with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015 the 2015 productivity initiative was completed during the third quarter 2016 final costs incurred in 2016 relating to this program totaled 5609  

operating profit and operating profit margin 

2018 compared with 2017 

operating profit increased 236 in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to higher gross profit lower impairment charges and business realignment costs and lower sma in the 2018 period operating profit margin increased to 208 in 2018 from 175 in 2017 driven by these same factors 

2017 compared with 2016 

operating profit increased 46 in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to higher gross profit and slightly lower sma expenses as discussed previously operating profit margin increased to 175 in 2017 from 169 in 2016 driven by the improvement in gross margin 

interest expense net 

2018 compared with 2017 

net interest expense was 406 million higher in 2018 than in 2017  the increase was due to higher levels of commercial paper issued to fund the amplify acquisition and higher interest rates on our shortterm debt as well as incremental interest on 12 billion of notes issued in may 2018 

2017 compared with 2016 

net interest expense was 81 million higher in 2017 than in 2016 the increase was due to higher levels of longterm debt outstanding and higher interest rates on commercial paper during the 2017 period as well as a decreased benefit from the fixed to floating swaps 

other income expense net 

2018 compared with 2017 

other income expense net totaled expense of 748 million in 2018 versus expense of 1044 million 2017  the decrease in the net expense was primarily due to lower nonservice cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2018 as well as lower writedowns on equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits 

2017 compared with 2016 

other income expense net totaled expense of 1044 million in 2017 versus expense of 656 million in 2016 in 2017 we recognized a 662 million writedown on equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits compared to a 435 million write down in 2016 in 2017 the nonservice cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 388 million compared to 494 million in 2016 additionally 2016 was offset by an extinguishment gain of 267 million related to the settlement of the sgm liability

our effective income tax rate was 170 for 2018 compared with 319 for 2017  relative to the 21 statutory rate the 2018 effective tax rate was impacted by a favorable foreign rate differential and investment tax credits which were partially offset by the impact of state taxes the 2017 effective rate relative to the previous statutory rate of 35 benefited from a favorable foreign rate differential investment tax credits and the benefit of asu 201609 for the accounting of employee sharebased payments which were partially offset by the impact of us tax reform and nonbenefited costs resulting from the margin for growth program 

2017 compared with 2016 

our effective income tax rate was 319 for 2017 compared with 345 for 2016 relative to the statutory rate the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by a favorable foreign rate differential relating to foreign operations and cocoa procurement investment tax credits and the benefit of asu 201609 for the accounting of employee sharebased payments which were partially offset by the impact of us tax reform and nonbenefited costs resulting from the margin for growth program the 2016 effective rate benefited from the impact of nontaxable income related to the settlement of the sgm liability and investment tax credits 

net income attributable to the hershey company and earnings per sharediluted

net income increased 3946 million  or 504  while epsdiluted increased 192  or 525  in 2018 compared with 2017  the increase in both net income and epsdiluted was driven primarily by 2018 higher gross profit lower impairment charges and business realignment costs lower sma and lower income taxes which were partly offset by higher interest expense as noted above our 2018 epsdiluted also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases including both current year and prior year repurchases from the milton hershey school trust the trust as well as current year repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs

segment results 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments north america and international and other the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis for segment reporting purposes we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses unallocated marktomarket gains and losses on commodity derivatives business realignment and impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation segment income and segment income margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations for further information see the nongaap information section of this mda 

our segment results including a reconciliation to our consolidated results were as follows 





north america 

the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery market position as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions in the united states and canada this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery pantry food service and other snacking product lines north america accounted for 886  881 and 878 of our net sales in 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively north america results for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 were as follows

our north america segment income decreased 241 million or 12 in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher trade promotional expense higher logistics costs unfavorable sales mix and additional plant costs as well as incremental sma expense including amortization expense from the amplify and pirate brands acquisitions these higher expenses more than offset reductions in advertising and related consumer marketing expense which declined 112 versus the 2017 period with the reduction driven by spend optimization and shifts relating to our emerging brands as advertising and related consumer marketing on our core us brands increased during the year 

2017 compared with 2016 

net sales of our north america segment increased 882 million or 13 in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by increased volume of 05 due to a longer easter season as well as 2017 innovation specifically hersheys cookie layer crunch  and the launch of hersheys gold and hersheys and reeses popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels additionally the barkthins brand acquisition contributed 03 net price realization increased by 04 due to decreased levels of trade promotional spending excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 01 the net sales of our north america segment increased by approximately 12 

our north america segment income increased 37 million or 02 in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher gross profit partially offset by investments in greater levels of advertising expense and gotomarket capabilities as well as unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher freight and warehousing costs 

international and other 

the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture import market sell or distribute chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery and other products currently this includes our operations in china and other asia markets latin america europe africa and the middle east along with exports to these regions while a less significant component this segment also includes our global retail operations including hershey’s chocolate world stores in hershey pennsylvania new york city las vegas niagara falls ontario and singapore as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world international and other accounted for 114  119 and 122 of our net sales in 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively international and other results for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 were as follows 



2018 compared with 2017 

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 48 million or 05 in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting a 44 reduction in net sales from the divestiture of sgm and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 18 partially offset by volume increases of 47 and favorable price realization of 10 excluding the sale of sgm and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates our international and other segment net sales increased 57 

the volume increase was primarily attributed to solid marketplace growth in india brazil and mexico where constant currency net sales increased by 263  84  and 62  respectively the favorable net price realization was driven by decreased levels of trade promotional spending compared to the prior year 

our international and other segment generated income of 738 million in 2018 compared to 115 million in 2017 with the improvement primarily resulting from our efforts to drive sustainable gross margin improvements as we executed our margin for growth program and optimize the product portfolio across various international markets additionally segment income benefited from continued growth across mexico brazil india and regional markets 

2017 compared with 2016 

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 129 million or 14 in 2017 compared to 2016 reflecting volume declines of 47 partially offset by favorable price realization of 27 and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 06 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the net sales of our international and other segment decreased by approximately 20 

the volume decrease is primarily attributed to our china business driven by softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings the favorable net price realization was driven by higher prices in select markets as well as reduced levels of trade promotional spending which declined significantly compared to the prior year constant currency net sales in mexico and brazil increased by 108 and 105 respectively driven by solid chocolate marketplace performance india also experienced constant currency net sales growth of 138 

our international and other segment generated income of 115 million in 2017 compared to a loss of 291 million in 2016 due to benefits from reduced trade promotional spending and lower operating expenses in china as a result of our margin for growth program additionally segment income benefited from the improved combined income in latin america and export markets versus the prior year 

unallocated corporate expense 

unallocated corporate expense includes centrallymanaged a corporate functional costs relating to legal treasury finance and human resources b expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations including warehousing distribution and manufacturing information systems and global shared services c noncash stockbased compensation expense and d other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance 

unallocated corporate expense totaled 4868 million in 2018 as compared to 4992 million in 2017 primarily driven by savings from our productivity and cost savings initiatives partially offset by spending on the multiyear implementation of our enterprise resource planning system in 2017 unallocated corporate expense increased 109 million from 4883 million in 2016 while we realized savings in 2017 from our productivity and cost savings initiatives these savings were more than offset by higher costs related to the multiyear implementation of our enterprise resource planning system as well as higher due diligence costs related to merger and acquisition activity 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased 3504 million relative to 2017 this increase was driven by the following factors 



 cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased 2361 million relative to 2016 this increase was driven by the following factors 

 pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 421 million 597 million and 728 million in 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 259 million 564 million and 417 million in 2018  2017 and 2016  

respectively 

investing activities 

our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property plant and equipment and capitalized software as well as acquisitions of businesses partially offset by proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment we used cash of 15029 million for investing activities in 2018 compared to 3286 million in 2017  with the increase driven by two business acquisitions in 2018 compared to no business acquisition activity in 2017 we used cash of 5954 million for investing activities in 2016  with the increases versus 2017 primarily driven by a business acquisition in 2016 

primary investing activities include the following 

 financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options financing activities in 2018 increased cash by 1161 million  compared to cash used of 8438 million in 2017  we used cash of 4644 million for financing activities in 2016  primarily to fund dividend payments and share repurchases partially offset by incremental borrowings 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 



 liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2018  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 5880 million at december 31 2017  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3802 million our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2018 increased 2078 million compared to the 2017 yearend balance as a result of the sources of net cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately 75 of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states the company recognized the onetime us repatriation tax due under us tax reform and as a result repatriation of these amounts would not be subject to additional us federal income tax but would be subject to applicable withholding taxes in the relevant jurisdiction our intent is to reinvest funds earned outside of the united states to finance foreign operations and investments and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 45 billion at december 31 2018 and 29 billion at december 31 2017  our total debt increased in 2018 mainly due to the additional notes issued midyear which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings that had been used to fund the amplify acquisition and repay amplifys outstanding debt owed under its existing credit agreement 

as a source of shortterm financing we maintain a 14 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  the termination date of this agreement is november 2020 we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions as of december 31 2018  we had 315 million of available capacity under the agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains 

certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2018  

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2018  we had available capacity of 273 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the trust established by milton s and catherine s hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition three representatives of hershey trust company currently serve as members of the companys board in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the trust in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company the companys board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company as trustee for the trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018  



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with longterm notes 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities 

3 includes the minimum rental commitments including interest expense under noncancelable capital leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities as well as vehicles 

4 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

5 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2018  the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2018  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant during 2018  2017  and 2016  actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3 our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled 1714 million and 1737 million at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations our related accounting policies accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

 

as of december 31 2018 our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 348 million we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount which is the greater of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the expected longterm rate of investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the longterm rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 10 million 

 

a 100 basis point decrease increase in the weightedaverage pension discount rate would increase decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 5 million and the december 31 2018 pension liability would increase by approximately 87 million or decrease by approximately 75 million respectively 

pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately 30 million in 2019 pension expense beyond 2019 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postemployment benefit plans 

changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and companyspecific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is indicated requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential up to the carrying value of goodwill we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

at december 31 2018  the net book value of our goodwill totaled 18011 million and related to four reporting units based on our most recent quantitative testing all of our reporting units had a percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of 100 or more therefore as it relates to our 2018 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter we tested all four reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist 

in february 2017 we commenced the margin for growth program which includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china longlived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset groups longlived assets therefore as a result of this testing during the first quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1059 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition 

in 2016 in connection with our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2018 and 2017 was 350 million the notional amount relates to fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2018 and 2017 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this now variablerate debt as of december 31 2018 would have increased interest expense by approximately 35 million for the full year 2018 and 2017 respectively 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable rates with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall 

and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 by approximately 121 million and 134 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

in order to manage interest rate exposure in previous years we utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions these swaps which were settled upon issuance of the related debt were designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses that were deferred in other comprehensive income are being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings during 2016 we had one interest rate swap agreement in a cash flow hedging relationship with a notional amount of 500 million which was settled in connection with the issuance of debt in august 2016 resulting in a payment of approximately 87 million which is reflected as an operating cash flow within the consolidated statement of cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2018 and 2017  the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of 25 million and a liability of 10 million respectively assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 45 million and 197 million respectively 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it can be difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2018 average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2017 and traded in a range between 088 and 123 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract cocoa production was higher during the 2017 to 2018 crop year and slightly outpaced the increase in global demand which led to a small rebuild in global cocoa stocks over the past year at the beginning of the year cocoa prices rallied sharply before declining in the second half due to increased supply relative to demand the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

during 2018 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 013 per pound to a high of 015 per pound on a class iv milk basis fluid dairy milk prices were lower than 2017 driven by higher us inventories 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the united states are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market united states delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from 038 to 040 per pound during 2018 

peanut prices in the united states ranged from a from a low of 045 per pound to a high of 050 per pound lower planted acreage and unfavorable weather conditions during harvest in the key us peanut growing regions resulted in an estimated 26 smaller crop versus the 2017 crop almond prices began the year at 289 per pound and closed the year at 298 per pound driven by record shipments and lower than expected yields for the 2018 crop 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 6935 million as of december 31 2018 and 4053 million as of december 31 2017 at the end of 2018 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2018 by 716 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of december 31 2018  based on that evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2018  

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system which will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years the initial changes to our consolidated financial reporting took place in the second quarter of 2018 the transition to the new financial reporting platform did not result in significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting however as the next phases of the updated processes are rolled out in connection with the erp implementation we will give appropriate consideration to whether these process changes necessitate changes in the design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting

disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control–integrated framework 2013 edition  based on this assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2018  the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of amplify snack brands inc or pirate brands which were acquired on january 31 2018 and october 17 2018 respectively and are included in the 2018 consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted 282 of total assets as of december 31 2018 and 40 of net sales for the year then ended

business

hershey is a global confectionery leader known for bringing goodness to the world through chocolate sweets mints and other great tasting snacks we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america a leading snack maker in the united states and a global leader in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery we market sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 80 countries worldwide 

reportable segments 

our organizational structure is designed to ensure continued focus on north america coupled with an emphasis on profitable growth in our focus international markets our business is organized around geographic regions which enables us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets as a result we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis as this aligns with how our chief operating decision maker “codm” manages our business including resource allocation and performance assessment our north america business which generates approximately 88  of our consolidated revenue is our only reportable segment none of our other operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments therefore these operating segments are combined and disclosed below as international and other 

 financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

business acquisitions 

in january 2018 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of amplify snack brands inc amplify a publicly traded company based in austin texas that owns several popular betterforyou snack brands such as skinnypop  oatmega  paqui and tyrrells  the acquisition enables us to capture more consumer snacking occasions by creating a broader portfolio of brands 

in april 2016 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ripple brand collective llc a privately held company based in congers new york that owns the barkthins  mass premium chocolate snacking brand the acquisition was undertaken in order to broaden our product offerings in the premium and portable snacking categories 

in march 2015 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of krave pure foods inc “krave” the sonoma california based manufacturer of krave  a leading allnatural brand of premium meat snack products the transaction was undertaken to enable us to tap into the rapidly growing meat snacks category and further expand into the broader snacks space 

products and brands 

our principal product offerings include chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery products gum and mint refreshment products pantry items such as baking ingredients toppings and beverages and snack items such as spreads meat snacks bars and snack bites and mixes popcorn and protein bars and cookies 

 principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2017  approximately 29  of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

in 2016 we established a trading company in switzerland that performs all aspects of cocoa procurement including price risk management physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight the trading company was implemented to optimize the supply chain for our cocoa requirements with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence it also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii and iv dairy products peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service in recent years we have also experienced increased competition from other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth 

working capital seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks the trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the united states and other key international markets where our products are sold we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s  and reese’s  brand names 

furthermore we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows

we believe our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety various government agencies and thirdparty firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging freight direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 29  of our total net sales in 2017  mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately 70 of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 



we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in january 2018 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of amplify snack brands inc while we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with this acquisition achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage hersheys resources expertise and capabilitybuilding in addition the acquisition of amplify is an important step in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as it should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key subsegment of the warehouse snack aisle if we are unable to successfully couple hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with amplify’s existing operations it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we derived approximately 17  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally approximately 25  of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2017  as part of our strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly in china malaysia mexico brazil and india as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business this in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 

we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies 

our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we may not fully realize the expected costs savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs which may have an adverse impact on our business 

we depend on our ability to evolve and grow and as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain longterm sustainable growth such as the margin for growth program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017 these programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency to reduce our costs andor to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs or that the benefits even if achieved will be adequate to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations which could in turn adversely affect our business 

complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system will replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain the company’s financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the company’s management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp system without experiencing delays increased costs and other difficulties if we are unable to successfully design and implement the new erp system as planned our financial positions results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the erp system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed

business model and growth strategy

overview 

the overview presented below is an executivelevel summary highlighting the key trends and measures on which the company’s management focuses in evaluating its financial condition and operating performance certain earnings and performance measures within the overview include financial information determined on a nongaap basis which aligns with how management internally evaluates the companys results of operations determines incentive compensation and assesses the impact of known trends and uncertainties on the business a detailed reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures referenced herein to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures follows this summary for a detailed analysis of the companys operations prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap referred to as reported herein refer to the discussion and analysis in the consolidated results of operations 

in 2017 we made solid progress on our strategic initiatives including strengthening our core chocolate brands positioning our snacks business for success and generating operating profit margin expansion these initiatives will benefit the company over the long term and enable us to achieve our sales and earnings per sharediluted eps targets we continued to generate solid operating cash flow totaling approximately 12 billion in 2017 which affords the company significant financial flexibility the recent acquisition of amplify is an important step in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as it should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key subsegment of the warehouse snack aisle 

our full year 2017 net sales totaled 75154 million  an increase of 10  versus 74402 million  for the comparable period of 2016 excluding a 02 impact from favorable foreign exchange rates our net sales increased 08 net sales growth was driven by lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the north america and international and other segments as well as higher sales volume in north america primarily from 2017 innovation and new launches including hersheys cookie layer crunch  hersheys gold  and hersheys and reeses popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels 

our reported gross margin was 458 for the full year 2017 an increase of 340 basis points compared to the full year 2016 our 2017 nongaap gross margin of 456  was on par with the prior year margin as the benefits from supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as lower input costs were offset by higher freight rates and increased levels of manufacturing and distribution costs associated with an effort to maintain customer service targets at fast growing retail customers 

our full year 2017 reported net income and epsdiluted totaled 7830 million and 366  respectively compared to the full year 2016 reported net income and epsdiluted of 7200 million and 334  respectively from a nongaap perspective full year 2017 adjusted net income was 10169 million  an increase of 72 versus 9485 million in 2016 our adjusted epsdiluted for the full year 2017 was 476 compared to 441 for the same period of 2016 an increase of 79  

nongaap information 

the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated marktomarket gains losses on commodity derivatives costs associated with business realignment activities costs relating to the integration of acquisitions nonservice related components of our pension expense nsrpe impairment of goodwill indefinite and longlived assets settlement of the sgm liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares of sgm the gain realized on the sale of a trademark costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt and other nonrecurring gains and losses 

to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance we use nongaap financial measures within mda that exclude the financial impact of these activities these nongaap financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures referenced in mda to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below 





 the tax effect for each adjustment is determined by calculating the tax impact of the adjustment on the companys quarterly effective tax rate 

in the assessment of our results we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the reported and nongaap financial measures presented above 



 

details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the nongaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows 

marktomarket gains losses on commodity derivatives 

the marktomarket gains losses on commodity derivatives are recorded as unallocated and excluded from adjusted results until such time as the related inventory is sold at which time the corresponding gains losses are reclassified from unallocated to segment income since we often purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years we make this adjustment to facilitate the yearoveryear comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged for the period for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the net adjustment recognized within unallocated was a gain of 353 million  and a loss of 1632 million  respectively see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

business realignment activities 

we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance longterm profitability for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we incurred 694 million  1076 million  and 1210 million  respectively of pretax costs related to business realignment activities see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

acquisition integration costs 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we incurred expenses totaling 03 million  and 65 million  respectively related to integration of the 2016 acquisition of ripple brand collective llc as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and information systems for the year ended december 31 2015 we incurred costs related to the integration of the 2014 acquisitions of sgm and the allan candy company and the 2015 acquisition of krave totaling 225 million as we incorporated these businesses into our operating practices and information systems these 2015 expenses included charges incurred to writedown approximately 64 million of expired or nearexpiration workinprocess inventory at sgm in connection with the implementation of our global quality standards and practices in addition integration costs for 2015 were offset by a 68 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration paid to the krave shareholders 

nonservice related pension expense 

nsrpe includes interest costs the expected return on pension plan assets the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits nsrpe can fluctuate from year to year as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year to year therefore we exclude nsrpe from our internal performance measures our most significant defined benefit pension plans have been closed to new participants for a number of years resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable we recorded pretax nsrpe of 350 million  272 million  and 181 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

goodwill indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

for the year ended december 31 2017 we incurred 2087 million  of pretax longlived asset impairment charges related to certain business realignment activities this includes a writedown of certain intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and writedown of property plant and equipment for the year ended december 31 2016 in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing of other indefinite lived assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million  primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india in the second and third quarters of 2015 we recorded a total 2808 million  noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill resulting from the sgm acquisition including 144 million relating to the portion of goodwill that had been allocated to our china chocolate reporting unit based on synergies to be realized by this business 

impact of us tax reform 

in connection with the enactment of us tax reform in december 2017 we recorded a net charge of 325 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 which includes the estimated impact of the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of nonus subsidiaries offset in part by the benefit from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate 

noncontrolling interest share of business realignment and impairment charges 

certain of the business realignment and impairment charges recorded in connection with the margin for growth program related to lotte shanghai foods co ltd a joint venture in which we own a 50 controlling interest therefore we have also adjusted for the portion of these charges included within the loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest 

settlement of sgm liability 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached an agreement with the sgm selling shareholders to reduce the originallyagreed purchase price for the remaining 20 of sgm and we completed the purchase on february 3 2016 in the first quarter of 2016 we recorded a 267 million gain relating to the settlement of the sgm liability representing the net carrying amount of the recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during the third quarter of 2015 we recorded a 283 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt relating to a cash tender offer see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

gain on sale of trademark 

during the first quarter of 2015 we recorded a 99 million gain relating to the sale of a noncore trademark 

constant currency net sales growth 

we present certain percentage changes in net sales on a constant currency basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange this measure is used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

to present this information for historical periods current period net sales for entities reporting in other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rates in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 

the following tables set forth a reconciliation between reported and constant currency growth rates for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  





consolidated results of operations 



net sales 

2017  compared with 2016   

net sales increased   10  in 2017  compared with 2016  reflecting favorable price realization of 07 a benefit from acquisitions of 03 and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 02 partially offset by a volume decrease of 02 excluding foreign currency our net sales increased 08 in 2017 the favorable net price realization was attributed to lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the north america and international and other segments versus the prior year consolidated volume decreased as a result of lower sales volume in the international and other segment primarily attributed to our china business and the softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings these volume decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in north america specifically from 2017 innovation and new launches including hersheys cookie layer crunch  hersheys gold  and hersheys and reeses popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels 

2016  compared with 2015   

net sales increased 07 in 2016 compared with 2015 reflecting volume increases of 08 and a 06 benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 07 excluding foreign currency our net sales increased 14 in 2016 the volume improvement was primarily driven by new chocolate and snacking products in the united states including snack mix snack bites and hersheys cookie layer crunch  bars while the north america segment had unfavorable price realization due to increased levels of trade promotional spending this was essentially offset by favorable price realization in the international and other segment due to significantly lower levels of trade spending and returns discounts and allowances 

key us marketplace metrics 

for the full year 2017 our us candy mint and gum cmg consumer takeaway increased 16 which was in line with the category increase resulting in market share of 306 the cmg consumer takeaway and market share information reflect measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution primarily include food drug mass merchandisers and convenience store channels plus walmart stores inc partial dollar club and military channels these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by information resources incorporated iri the companys market insights and analytics provider and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category the amounts presented above are solely for the us cmg category which does not include revenue from our snack mixes and grocery items for the full year 2017 our us retail takeaway increased 12 in the expanded multioutlet combined plus convenience store channels iri mulo  cstores which includes candy mint gum salty snacks snack bars meat snacks and grocery items 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2017  compared with 2016   

cost of sales decreased   49  in 2017  compared with 2016  the reduction was driven by lower commodity costs coupled with an incremental 1160 million favorable impact from markingtomarket our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years commodity purchases a 530 million decrease in business realignment costs and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives these benefits were offset in part by higher freight and warehousing costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances 

gross margin increased  by 340  basis points in 2017  compared with 2016  lower commodity costs coupled with the favorable yearoveryear marktomarket impact from commodity derivative instruments lower business realignment costs and supply chain productivity contributed to the improvement in gross margin however higher supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix partially offset the increase in gross margin 

2016  compared with 2015   

cost of sales increased 70 in 2016 compared with 2015 incremental business realignment costs and marktomarket losses on commodity derivative instruments increased cost of sales by 53 while the remaining increase was primarily attributed to higher volume and higher supply chain costs in part due to higher manufacturing variances and some incremental fixed costs related to the commencement of manufacturing in the malaysia facility 

gross margin decreased by 340 basis points in 2016 compared with 2015 marktomarket losses on commodity derivative instruments and incremental depreciation expense related to business realignment activities drove a 300 basis point decline in gross margin higher trade promotional spending and supply chain costs also contributed to the decreased gross margin but were partially offset by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives 

selling marketing and administrative 

2017  compared with 2016   

selling marketing and administrative “sma” expenses decreased   20 million  or 01  in 2017  advertising and related consumer marketing expense remaining consistent with 2016 levels as higher spending by the north america segment was offset by reduced spending by the international and other segment while 2017 sma benefited from costs savings and efficiency initiatives lower business realignment costs and lower acquisition integration costs these savings were offset in part by higher pension settlement charges and higher costs related to acquisition due diligence activities and the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system 

2016  compared with 2015   

sma expenses decreased 539 million or 27 in 2016 advertising and related consumer marketing expense decreased 40 during this period we spent less on advertising and related consumer marketing in our international and other segment particularly in the china market and our spending in north america declined as our marketing mix models were weighted toward higher trade promotional spending excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs selling and administrative expenses for 2016 decreased by 20 as compared to 2015 as a result of our continued focus on reducing nonessential spending sma expenses in 2016 were also impacted by business realignment costs of 186 million nsrpe of 152 million and acquisition and integration costs of 65 million in 2015 sma expenses included business realignment costs of 174 million nsrpe of 156 million and acquisition and integration costs of 136 million 

goodwill indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

in 2017 we recorded longlived asset impairment charges totaling 1060 million to writedown distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and wrotedown property plant and equipment by 1027 million 

in 2016 in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india 

in 2015 we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling 2808 million resulting from our reassessment of the valuation of the sgm business coupled with the writedown of goodwill attributed to the china chocolate business in connection with the sgm acquisition from september 2014 

the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

business realignment activities 

we are currently pursuing several business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind key growth strategies costs recorded for business realignment activities during 2017  2016  and 2015  are as follows 

costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our consolidated statements of income as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

margin for growth program 

in february 2017 the companys board of directors unanimously approved several initiatives under a single program designed to drive continued net sales operating income and earnings pershare diluted growth over the next several years this program will focus on improving global efficiency and effectiveness optimizing the company’s supply chain streamlining the company’s operating model and reducing administrative expenses to generate longterm savings 

the company estimates that the “margin for growth” program will result in total pretax charges of 375 million  to 425 million  from 2017 to 2019 this estimate includes plant and office closure expenses of 100 million  to 115 million  net intangible asset impairment charges of 100 million  to 110 million  employee separation costs of 80 million  to 100 million  contract termination costs of approximately 25 million  and other business realignment costs of 70 million  to 75 million  the cash portion of the total charge is estimated to be 150 million  to 175 million  at the conclusion of the program in 2019 ongoing annual savings are expected to be approximately 150 million  to 175 million  the company expects that implementation of the program will reduce its global workforce by approximately 15  with a majority of the reductions coming from hourly headcount positions outside of the united states 

the program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china longlived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset groups longlived assets therefore as a result of this testing during the first quarter of 2017 we recorded impairment charges totaling 2087 million  with 1060 million  representing the 

portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and 1027 million  representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to property plant and equipment these impairment charges are recorded in the longlived asset impairment charges caption within the consolidated statements of operations 

during 2017 we recognized estimated employee severance totaling 326 million  these charges relate largely to our initiative to improve the cost structure of our china business as well as our initiative to further streamline our corporate operating model we also recognized noncash assetrelated incremental depreciation expense totaling 69 million  as part of optimizing the north america supply chain during 2017 we also recognized other program costs totaling 164 million  these charges relate primarily to thirdparty charges for our initiative of improving global efficiency and effectiveness 

operational optimization program 

in the second quarter of 2016 we commenced a program the “operational optimization program” to optimize our production and supply chain network which includes select facility consolidations the program encompasses the continued transition of our china chocolate and sgm operations into a united golden hershey  platform including the integration of the china sales force as well as workforce planning efforts and the consolidation of production within certain facilities in china and north america 

for the year ended december 31 2017  we incurred pretax costs totaling 135 million  primarily related to employee severance associated with the workforce planning efforts within north america we currently expect to incur additional cash costs of approximately 8 million  over the next twelve months  to complete this program 

2015 productivity initiative 

in mid2015 we initiated a productivity initiative the “2015 productivity initiative” intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer to enable a more enterprisewide approach to innovation to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda and to provide for a more efficient cost structure while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas overall the 2015 productivity initiative was undertaken to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the companys ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer 

the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2015 resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300  positions with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015 the 2015 productivity initiative was completed during the third quarter 2016 we incurred total costs of 125 million  relating to this program including pension settlement charges of 137 million  recorded in 2016 and 102 million  recorded in 2015 relating to lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company as a result of this program 

other international restructuring programs 

costs incurred for the year ended december 31 2015 related principally to accelerated depreciation and amortization and employee severance costs for minor programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain nonus manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our exit from the bauducco joint venture 

operating profit and operating profit margin 

2017  compared with 2016   

operating profit increased   57  in 2017  compared with 2016  due primarily to higher gross profit and slightly lower sma expenses as discussed previously operating profit margin increased  to 170  in 2017  from 162  in 2016  driven by the improvement in gross margin 

2016  compared with 2015   

operating profit increased 162 in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges lower sma costs and lower business realignment costs offset in part by the lower gross profit operating profit margin increased to 162 in 2016 from 140 in 2015 due primarily to these same factors 

interest expense net 

2017  compared with 2016   

net interest expense was 81 million   higher  in 2017  than in 2016  the increase was due to higher levels of longterm debt outstanding and higher interest rates on commercial paper during the 2017 period as well as a decreased benefit from the fixed to floating swaps 

2016  compared with 2015   

net interest expense was 156 million lower in 2016 than in 2015 as the 2015 amount included the premium paid to repurchase longterm debt as part of a cash tender offer this decrease was partially offset by lower capitalized interest expense and lower interest income 

other income expense net 

2017  compared with 2016   

other income expense net totaled expense of 657 million  in 2017  versus expense of 162 million   2016  in 2017 we recognized a 662 million writedown on equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits compared to a 435 million write down in 2016 additionally 2016 was offset by an extinguishment gain of 267 million related to the settlement of the sgm liability 

2016  compared with 2015   

other income expense net totaled expense of 162 million in 2016 versus expense of 301 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily due to the 267 million settlement of the sgm liability in 2016 partially offset by an increase in the writedown of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits 

income taxes and effective tax rate 

2017  compared with 2016   

our effective income tax rate was 319  for 2017  compared with 345  for 2016  relative to the statutory rate the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by a favorable foreign rate differential relating to foreign operations and cocoa procurement investment tax credits and the benefit of asu 201609 for the accounting of employee sharebased payments which were partially offset by the impact of us tax reform and nonbenefited costs resulting from the margin for growth program the 2016 effective rate benefited from the impact of nontaxable income related to the settlement of the sgm liability and investment tax credits 

2016  compared with 2015   

our effective income tax rate was 345 for 2016 compared with 431 for 2015 relative to the statutory rate the 2016 effective tax rate was impacted by greater benefits from manufacturing deductions research and development and investment tax credits and a favorable foreign rate differential relating to our cocoa procurement operations 

net income attributable to the hershey company and earnings per sharediluted 

2017  compared with 2016   

net income increased   629 million  or 87  while epsdiluted increased   032  or 96  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase in both net income and epsdiluted were driven by higher gross profit lower sma and lower income taxes partly offset by the longlived asset impairment charges and higher writedowns relating to tax credit investments as noted above our 2017 epsdiluted also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases including a current year repurchase from the milton hershey school trust and prior year repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

2016  compared with 2015   

net income increased 2070 million or 404 while epsdiluted increased 102 or 440 in 2016 compared with 2015 the increases in both net income and epsdiluted were driven by the lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges lower sma costs and lower business realignment costs as noted above our 2016 epsdiluted also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

segment results 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments north america and international and other the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis for segment reporting purposes we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses unallocated marktomarket gains and losses on commodity derivatives business realignment and impairment charges acquisition integration costs and nsrpe that are not part of our measurement of segment performance these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation segment income and segment income margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations for further information see the nongaap information section of this mda 

our segment results including a reconciliation to our consolidated results were as follows 





north america 

the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery market position as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions in the united states and canada this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery pantry food service and other snacking product lines north america accounted for 881  878  and 876  of our net sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively north america results for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 

2017  compared with 2016   

net sales of our north america segment increased 882 million or 13  in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by increased volume of 05 due to a longer easter season as well as 2017 innovation specifically hersheys cookie layer crunch  and the launch of hersheys gold  and hersheys and reeses popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels additionally the barkthins brand acquisition contributed 03 net price realization increased by 04 due to decreased levels of trade promotional spending excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 01 the net sales of our north america segment increased by approximately 12 

our north america segment income increased 46 million or 02  in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher gross profit partially offset by investments in greater levels of advertising expense and gotomarket capabilities as well as unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher freight and warehousing costs 

2016  compared with 2015   

net sales of our north america segment increased 649 million or 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting volume increases of 14 and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 07 partially offset by unfavorable net price realization of 09 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 02 our 2016 north america performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other cpg companies additionally the us cmg category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter easter season and merchandising and display strategies at select customers the segments volume increase was primarily attributable to new product introductions partially offset by lower everyday product sales the unfavorable net price realization resulted from increased levels of trade promotional spending necessary to support higher levels of instore merchandising and display activity our canada operations were impacted by the stronger us dollar which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact 

our north america segment income decreased 330 million or 16 in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by lower gross margin as higher trade promotional spending and higher supply chain costs were only partially offset by the benefit from supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives 

international and other 

the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture import market sell or distribute chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery and other products currently this includes our operations in china and other asia markets latin america europe africa and the middle east along with exports to these regions while a less significant component this segment also includes our global retail operations including hershey’s chocolate world stores in hershey pennsylvania new york city las vegas niagara falls ontario dubai and singapore as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world international and other accounted for 119  122  and 124  of our net sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively international and other results for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



2017  compared with 2016   

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 129 million or 14  in 2017 compared to 2016 reflecting volume declines of 47 partially offset by favorable price realization of 27 and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 06 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the net sales of our international and other segment decreased by approximately 20 

the volume decrease is primarily attributed to our china business driven by softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings the favorable net price realization was driven by higher prices in select markets as well as reduced levels of trade promotional spending which declined significantly compared to the prior year constant currency net sales in mexico and brazil increased by 108  and 105  respectively driven by solid chocolate marketplace performance india also experienced constant currency net sales growth of 138  

our international and other segment generated income of 115 million in 2017 compared to a loss of 291 million in 2016 due to benefits from reduced trade promotional spending and lower operating expenses in china as a result of our margin for growth program additionally segment income benefited from the improved combined income in latin america and export markets versus the prior year 

2016  compared with 2015   

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 113 million or 12 in 2016 compared to 2015   reflecting an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 44 volume declines of 37 and the unfavorable impact of net acquisitions and divestitures of 01 substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 70 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the net sales of our international and other segment increased by approximately 32 

the favorable net price realization was driven by lower direct trade expense as well as lower returns discounts and allowances in china which declined significantly compared to the prior year the volume decrease primarily related to lower sales in india due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business as well as lower sales in our global retail and licensing business partially offset by net sales increases in latin america and select export markets constant currency net sales in mexico and brazil increased on a combined basis by approximately 13 driven by solid chocolate marketplace performance 

our international and other segment loss decreased 690 million in 2016 compared to 2015 combined income in latin america and export markets improved versus the prior year and performance in china benefited from lower direct trade and returns discounts and allowances that were significantly lower than the prior year 

unallocated corporate expense 

unallocated corporate expense includes centrallymanaged a corporate functional costs relating to legal treasury finance and human resources b expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations including warehousing distribution and manufacturing information systems and global shared services c noncash stockbased compensation expense and d other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance 

unallocated corporate expense totaled 5043 million in 2017 as compared to 4974 million in 2016 while we realized savings in 2017 from our productivity and cost savings initiatives these savings were more than offset by higher costs related to the multiyear implementation of our enterprise resource planning system as well as higher due diligence costs related to merger and acquisition activity unallocated corporate expense in 2016 was consistent with 2015 levels as savings realized from our productivity and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employeerelated costs and an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased 2361 million  relative to 2016 this increase was driven by the following factors 



 cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased 2429 million  relative to 2015 this decrease was driven by the following factors 

 pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 597 million 728 million and 668 million in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 564 million 417 million and 533 million in 2017  2016  and 2015  

respectively 

investing activities 

our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property plant and equipment and capitalized software purchases of shortterm investments and acquisitions of businesses partially offset by proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment and shortterm investments we used cash of 3286 million  for investing activities in 2017  compared to 5954 million  in 2016  with the decrease driven by less business acquisition activity in 2017 compared to 2016 we used cash of 4772 million  for investing activities in 2015  which was primarily driven by lower business acquisition investment and sales of shortterm investments relative to 2017 and 2016 

primary investing activities include the following 

 financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options we used cash of 8438 million  for financing activities in 2017  compared to 4644 million  in 2016  we used cash of 7970 million  for financing activities in 2015  primarily to fund dividend payments and share repurchases 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 



approved an additional 100 million share repurchase authorization to commence after the existing 2016 authorization is completed 

 liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2017  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3802 million at december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 2970 million our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017 increased 832 million  compared to the 2016 yearend balance as a result of the sources of net cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately 75 of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017  was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states the company recognized the onetime us repatriation tax due under us tax reform and as a result repatriation of these amounts would not be subject to additional us federal income tax but would be subject to applicable withholding taxes in the relevant jurisdiction our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 29 billion at december 31 2017  and 30 billion at december 31 2016  our total debt decreased slightly in 2017 as we reduced our commercial paper and shortterm foreign borrowings 

as a source of shortterm financing we maintain a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase borrowings by an additional 400 million with the consent of the lenders as of december 31 2017  the termination date of this agreement is november 2020 we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions as of december 31 2017  we had 551 million of available capacity under the agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2017  

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2017  we had available capacity of 329 million under these lines of credit 

on january 8 2018 we entered into an additional credit facility under which the company may borrow up to 15 billion on an unsecured revolving basis funds borrowed may be used for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and acquisitions this facility is scheduled to expire on january 7 2019 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the trust established by milton s and catherine s hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school such trust the milton hershey school trust maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition a representative of hershey trust company currently serves as a member of the companys board in performing his responsibilities on the company’s board this representative may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the milton hershey school trust in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company the companys board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company as trustee for the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with longterm notes 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities 

3 includes the minimum rental commitments including interest expense under noncancelable capital leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities 

4 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

5 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2017  the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2017  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and 

actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past 

our trade promotional costs totaled 11332 million 11574 million and 11223 million in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant over the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than 3 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations our related accounting policies accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

 

as of december 31 2017 our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 345 million we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount which is the greater of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the expected longterm rate of investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other 

actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the longterm rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 10 million 

 

a 100 basis point decrease increase in the weightedaverage pension discount rate would increase decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 4 million and the december 31 2017 pension liability would increase by approximately 100 million or decrease by approximately 85 million respectively 

pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately 13 million in 2018 pension expense beyond 2018 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postemployment benefit plans 

changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate 

 goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and companyspecific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is indicated requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential up to the carrying value of goodwill we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to 

evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

at december 31 2017  the net book value of our goodwill totaled 8211 million and related to five reporting units based on our most recent quantitative testing all of our reporting units had a percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of at least 100 therefore as it relates to our 2017 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter we tested all five reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist 

in february 2017 we commenced the margin for growth program which includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china longlived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset groups longlived assets therefore as a result of this testing during the first quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1059 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition 

in 2016 in connection with our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india 

in 2015 we recorded a 2808 million impairment charge resulting from our interim reassessment of the valuation of the sgm business coupled with the writedown of goodwill attributed to the china chocolate business in connection with the sgm acquisition as a result of declining performance levels and our postacquisition assessment we determined that gaap required an interim impairment test of the sgm reporting unit we performed the first step of this test as of july 5 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business the results of this test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount as of the measurement date suggesting that a goodwill impairment was probable which required us to perform a second step analysis to confirm that an impairment existed and to determine the amount of the impairment based on our reassessed value of the reporting unit although preliminary as a result of this reassessment in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated 2498 million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5 2015 during the third quarter we increased the value of acquired goodwill by 166 million with the corresponding offset principally represented by the establishment of additional opening balance sheet liabilities for additional commitments and contingencies that were identified through our postacquisition assessment we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit which resulted in a writeoff of this additional goodwill in the third quarter for a total impairment of 2664 million as of the date of our original impairment test we also tested the other longlived assets of sgm for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and no impairment was indicated 

in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition we had assigned approximately 15 million of goodwill to our existing china chocolate business as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkeybranded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks as the net sales and earnings of our china business continued to be adversely impacted by macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior through the third quarter of 2015 we determined that an interim impairment test of the goodwill in this reporting unit was also required we performed the first step of this test in the third quarter of 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business the results of this test suggested that a goodwill impairment was probable and the conclusions of the second step analysis resulted in a writedown of 144 million representing the full value of goodwill attributed to this reporting unit as of october 4 2015 as of the date of our original impairment test we also tested the other longlived assets of the china asset group for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and no impairment was indicated 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  was 350 million the notional amount relates to fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2017 and 2016 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this now variablerate debt as of december 31 2017 would have increased interest expense by approximately 35 million and 36 million for the full year 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable rates with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 by approximately 134 million and 142 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

in order to manage interest rate exposure in previous years we utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions these swaps which were settled upon issuance of the related debt were designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses that were deferred in other comprehensive income are being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings during 2016 we had one interest rate swap agreement in a cash flow hedging relationship with a notional amount of 500 million which was settled in connection with the issuance of debt in august 2016 resulting in a payment of approximately 87 million which is reflected as an operating cash flow within the consolidated statement of cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2017  and 2016  the net fair value of these instruments was a liability of 10 million and an asset of 14 million respectively assuming an 

unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 197 million and 96 million respectively 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it can be difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2017 average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with 2016 and traded in a range between 087 and 099 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract cocoa production was higher during the 2016 to 2017 crop year and outpaced the increases in global demand which led to a rebuild in global cocoa stocks over the past year as a result cocoa prices declined in 2017 versus 2016 due to excess supply relative to demand the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

during 2017 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 014 per pound to a high of 016 per pound on a class iv milk basis dairy prices were higher than 2016 driven by a decline in milk production in europe and new zealand additionally in 2017 dairy butter prices reached record highs at 250 per pound as european union inventories were strained by a supply shortage and adverse weather 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the united states are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market united states delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from 038 to 040 per pound during 2017 

peanut prices in the united states began the year around 065 per pound and closed the year at 047 per pound higher planted acreage and optimal growing conditions throughout 2017 in the key us peanut growing regions resulted in an estimated 21 larger crop versus the 2016 crop and drove price decreases almond prices began the year at 284 per pound and closed the year at 284 per pound almond supply is ample to support us demand heading into 2018 as the 2017 crop is expected to be approximately 51 larger than the 2016 crop source almond board of california  

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 4053 million as of december 31 2017 and 7394 million as of december 31 2016 at the end of 2017 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2017 by 386 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

our organizational structure is designed to ensure continued focus on north america coupled with an emphasis on profitable growth in our focus international markets our business is organized around geographic regions which enables us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets as a result we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis as this aligns with how our chief operating decision maker “codm” manages our business including resource allocation and performance assessment our north america business which generates approximately 88  of our consolidated revenue is our only reportable segment none of our other operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments therefore these operating segments are combined and disclosed below as international and other 

 financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

business acquisitions and divestitures 

in april 2016 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ripple brand collective llc a privately held company based in congers new york that owns the barkthins  mass premium chocolate snacking brand the acquisition was undertaken in order to broaden our product offerings in the premium and portable snacking categories 

in march 2015 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of krave pure foods inc “krave” the sonoma california based manufacturer of krave  a leading allnatural brand of premium meat snack products the transaction was undertaken to enable us to tap into the rapidly growing meat snacks category and further expand into the broader snacks space

hypermarket channels we completed the purchase of the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares of sgm on february 3 2016 

products 

our principal product offerings include chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery products gum and mint refreshment products pantry items such as baking ingredients toppings and beverages and snack items such as spreads meat snacks bars and snack bites and mixes 

 principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2016  approximately 25  of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

in 2016 we established a trading company in switzerland that performs all aspects of cocoa procurement including price risk management physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight the trading company was implemented to optimize the supply chain for our cocoa requirements with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence it also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii and iv dairy products peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service in recent years we have also experienced increased competition from other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth 

working capital seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks the trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the united states and other key international markets where our products are sold we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s  and reese’s  brand names 

furthermore we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows

we believe our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety various government agencies and thirdparty firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 25  of our total net sales in 2016  mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which has pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately twothirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 



we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

during 2016 we successfully completed the sgm integration however additional challenges remain including challenges associated with the macroeconomic environment in china which could affect our strategy and could have a negative impact on the results of operations and cash flows of our international and other reportable segment 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2016  we derived approximately 17  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states compared to 17  in 2015  and 19  in 2014  additionally approximately 30  of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2016  as part of our strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly in china malaysia mexico and brazil as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies 

our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we may not fully realize the expected costs savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs which may have an adverse impact on our business 

we depend on our ability to evolve and grow and as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain longterm sustainable growth such as the production and supply chain network optimization program we commenced in the second quarter of 2016 these programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency to reduce our costs andor to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs or that the benefits even if achieved will be adequate to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations which could in turn adversely affect our business

the mda is organized in the following sections 



overview and outlook 

we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery we market sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide we report our operations through two segments north america and international and other 

in 2016 we made good progress against our strategic objectives including a focus on our consumer brand engagement and continued refinement of our mix of marketing investments these initiatives as well as improved analytics operating efficiencies and new information technology capabilities strengthened our business model and positioned the company for future growth we continued to generate solid operating cash flow totaling approximately 1 billion in 2016 which affords the company significant financial flexibility we are also in the process of conducting a strategic review of our global cost structure that we believe will result in solid gross and earnings before interest and taxes ebit margin expansion once executed 

our 2016 marketplace performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other consumer packaged goods cpg companies additionally the us candy mint and gum cmg category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter easter season and merchandising and display strategies at select customers for the full year us cmg retail takeaway increased 04 lower than the historical average our us cmg market share performance improved in the second half of 2016 resulting in full year market share of 312 including barkthins  which is approximately in line with the prior year for the full year 2016 our us market share including cmg salty snacks snack bars meat snacks grocery items and barkthins  increased approximately 10 basis points 

our full year 2016 net sales totaled 74402 million an increase of 07 versus 73866 million in 2015 excluding a 07 impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates our net sales increased 14 the increase was driven by higher north america volumes largely in products supported by increased promotional programming such as ncaa march madness the summer olympics and ncaa football college game day as well as new product innovation such as snack mix snack bites and hersheys cookie layer crunch  bars additionally our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 included approximately 356 million attributed to barkthins  our full year 2016 net income and earnings per sharediluted eps increased 404 and 440 respectively compared to 2015 results which were impacted by significant goodwill impairment charges excluding these goodwill impairment charges in 2015 and other items impacting comparability in both periods as defined in the nongaap information section of this mda 2016 adjusted net income increased 43 reflecting the benefits from continued productivity and cost savings initiatives and a lower effective income tax rate while adjusted epsdiluted also benefited from recent share buybacks increasing a total of 70 

for 2017 we expect net sales growth of approximately 2 to 3 which includes a 05 net benefit from acquisitions and a 025 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates excluding the unfavorable impact from 

foreign currency exchange rates our net sales are expected to increase approximately 225 to 325 our focus is on the continued rollout of hersheys cookie layer crunch  bars barkthins  chocolate distribution gains and other new products such as reeses  crunchers candy and krave  meat bars and sticks we anticipate that these investments and related consumer marketing plans will accelerate our north america sales growth versus 2016 performance which should enable us to outpace the broader food group in this challenging operating environment our previously discussed productivity and cost savings programs are on track and we will continue to focus on reducing nonessential spending going into 2017 additionally our effective tax rate is expected to be favorable versus 2016 driven by a favorable international tax mix tax credits and other incentives and the adoption of accounting standards update 201609 compensation—stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  as a result we expect full year 2017 reported epsdiluted prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap to improve and be in the 454 to 465 range from a nongaap perspective we currently expect 2017 adjusted epsdiluted to increase approximately 7 to 9 and to be in the 472 to 481 range a reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2017 are reflected in the nongaap reconciliations that follow 

nongaap information 

the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated marktomarket losses on commodity derivatives costs associated with business realignment activities costs relating to the integration of acquisitions nonservice related components of our pension expense income nsrpei goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges settlement of the sgm liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares of sgm the gain realized on the sale of a trademark costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt and other nonrecurring gains and losses 

to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance we use nongaap financial measures within mda that exclude the financial impact of these activities these nongaap financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures referenced in mda to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below 



 the tax impact is determined by multiplying each pretax reconciling adjustment by the applicable statutory income tax rates taking into consideration the impact of valuation allowances as applicable 

in the assessment of our results we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the reported and nongaap financial measures presented above 



 

details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the nongaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows 

marktomarket losses on commodity derivatives 

commensurate with our discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment for commodity derivatives we are adjusting the marktomarket losses on such commodity derivatives until such time as the related inventory is sold since we often purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years we make this adjustment to facilitate the yearoveryear comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged for the period for the year ended december 31 2016 unallocated marktomarket losses on commodity derivatives totaled 1632 million 

business realignment activities 

we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance longterm profitability for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred 1076 million 1210 million and 343 million respectively of pretax costs related to business realignment activities see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

acquisition integration costs 

for the year ended december 31 2016 we incurred expenses totaling 65 million related to integration of the 2016 acquisition of ripple brand collective llc as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and information systems for the year ended december 31 2015 we incurred costs related to the integration of the 2014 acquisitions of sgm and the allan candy company and the 2015 acquisition of krave totaling 225 million as we incorporated these businesses into our operating practices and information systems these 2015 expenses included charges incurred to writedown approximately 64 million of expired or nearexpiration workinprocess inventory at sgm in connection with the implementation of our global quality standards and practices in addition integration costs for 2015 were offset by a 68 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration paid to the krave shareholders for the year ended december 31 2014 we incurred costs of 133 million largely related to the acquisition of sgm offset by a 46 million gain relating to the acquisition of a controlling interest in lotte shanghai foods co ltd 

nonservice related pension expense income 

nsrpei includes interest costs the expected return on pension plan assets the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits nsrpei can fluctuate from year to year as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year to year therefore we exclude nsrpei from our internal performance measures our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants in 2007 resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable we recorded pretax nsrpei of 272 million 181 million and 18 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

settlement of sgm liability 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached an agreement with the sgm selling shareholders to reduce the originallyagreed purchase price for the remaining 20 of sgm and we completed the purchase on february 3 2016 in the first quarter of 2016 we recorded a 267 million gain relating to the settlement of the sgm liability representing the net carrying amount of the recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares 

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing of other indefinite lived assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india in the second and third quarters of 2015 we recorded a total 2808 million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill resulting from the sgm acquisition including 144 million relating to the portion of goodwill that had been allocated to our china chocolate reporting unit based on synergies to be realized by this business for the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges totaling 159 million associated with our business in india 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during the third quarter of 2015 we recorded a 283 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt relating to a cash tender offer see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

gain on sale of trademark 

during the first quarter of 2015 we recorded a 99 million gain relating to the sale of a noncore trademark 

constant currency net sales growth 

we present certain percentage changes in net sales on a constant currency basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange this measure is used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

to present this information for historical periods current period net sales for entities reporting in other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rates in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 

a reconciliation between reported and constant currency growth rates is provided below 



2017  outlook 

the following table provides a reconciliation of projected 2017  epsdiluted prepared in accordance with gaap to projected nongaap epsdiluted for 2017  prepared on a nongaap basis with adjustments consistent to those discussed previously the reconciliation of 2016  and 2015  epsdiluted prepared in accordance with gaap to 2016  and 2015  nongaap epsdiluted is provided below for comparison 



our 2017  projected epsdiluted as presented above does not include the impact of marktomarket gains and losses on our commodity derivative contracts due to the volatility of commodity market prices it is not possible to forecast this marktomarket impact pursuant to our revised accounting policy for commodity derivatives as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we currently reflect changes in the fair value of our commodity derivatives as incurred within cost of goods sold with an adjustment within our corporate unallocated expenses to enable us to present the gains and losses on commodity derivatives within our segment income at the time the related inventory is sold 

consolidated results of operations 



net sales 

2016  compared with 2015   

net sales increased   07  in 2016  compared with 2015  reflecting volume increases of 08 and a 06 benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 07 excluding foreign currency our net sales increased 14 in 2016 the volume improvement was primarily driven by new chocolate and snacking products in the united states including snack mix snack bites and hersheys cookie layer crunch  bars while the north america segment had unfavorable price realization due to increased levels of trade promotional spending this was essentially offset by favorable price realization in the international and other segment due to significantly lower levels of trade spending and returns discounts and allowances 

2015  compared with 2014   

net sales decreased 05 in 2015 compared with 2014 reflecting volume declines of 34 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 16 substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 35 as well as a 10 benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures the favorable net price realization primarily in the united states was attributed to the price increase announced in mid2014 the volume declines were attributed to volume elasticity relating to the pricing action in the united states as well as lower everyday product sales given the challenging shopper environment in north america coupled with lower sales in china excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates our net sales increased 11 in 2015 

key us cmg marketplace metrics 



the consumer takeaway and market share information provided above are for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution primarily include food drug mass merchandisers and convenience store channels plus walmart stores inc partial dollar club and military channels these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category 

the amounts presented above are solely for the us cmg category which does not include revenue from our snack mixes and grocery items for the full year 2016 our cmg market share including barkthins  was 312 about the same as 2015 including barkthins  cmg salty snacks snack bars meat snacks and grocery items our full year us market share increased approximately 10 basis points 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2016  compared with 2015   

cost of sales increased   70  in 2016  compared with 2015  incremental business realignment costs and marktomarket losses on commodity derivative instruments increased cost of sales by 53 while the remaining increase was primarily attributed to higher volume and higher supply chain costs in part due to higher manufacturing variances and some incremental fixed costs related to the commencement of manufacturing in the malaysia facility as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements our commodity derivative instruments are no longer designated for hedge accounting treatment and as a result the changes in fair market value are recognized currently in cost of sales 

gross margin decreased  by 340  basis points in 2016  compared with 2015  marktomarket losses on commodity derivative instruments and incremental depreciation expense related to business realignment activities drove a 300 basis point decline in gross margin higher trade promotional spending and supply chain costs also contributed to the decreased gross margin but were partially offset by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives on a nongaap basis excluding the losses on commodity derivative instruments as well as business realignment costs 2016 adjusted gross margin decreased by 40 basis points 

2015  compared with 2014   

cost of sales decreased 20 in 2015 compared with 2014 supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced cost of sales by approximately 66 these declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 41 in addition cost of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of 73 million business realignment costs of 88 million and nsrpe of 25 million which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 05 in comparison cost of sales benefited by 11 million in 2014 primarily due to nsrpi 

gross margin increased by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014 favorable net price realization as well as supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points however these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable sales mix which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points on a nongaap basis excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis points 

selling marketing and administrative 

2016  compared with 2015   

selling marketing and administrative “sma” expenses decreased   539 million  or 27  in 2016  advertising and related consumer marketing expense decreased 40 during this period we spent less on advertising and related consumer marketing in our international and other segment particularly in the china market and our spending in north america declined as our marketing mix models were weighted toward higher trade promotional spending excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs selling and administrative expenses for 2016 decreased by 20 as compared to 2015 as a result of our continued focus on reducing nonessential spending sma expenses in 2016 were also impacted by business realignment costs of 186 million nsrpe of 152 million and acquisition and integration costs of 65 million in 2015 sma expenses included business realignment costs of 174 million nsrpe of 156 million and acquisition and integration costs of 136 million 

2015  compared with 2014   

sma expenses increased 709 million or 37 in 2015 advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 10 during this period excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs selling and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 67 compared to 2014 driven by incremental increases from acquired businesses excluding the impact of acquisition costs sma expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued focus on reducing nonessential spending sma expenses in 2015 were also impacted by charges of 136 million attributed to the productivity initiative we announced in june 2015 acquisition and integration costs of 136 million nsrpe of 156 million and other business realignment costs of 37 million in 2014 sma expenses included acquisition and integration costs of 124 million other business realignment costs of 29 million and nsrpe of 09 million 

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

in 2016 in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets we recognized a trademark impairment charge of 42 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india 

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the sgm business performed below expectations throughout 2015 with net sales and earnings levels well below preacquisition levels as of result of this declining performance in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of 2498 million relating to the sgm reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015 we updated our estimates of the acquisitiondate fair values of the net assets acquired which increased the value of acquired goodwill by 166 million we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit which resulted in an additional 166 million writeoff of this increase to goodwill during the third quarter of 2015 we also wrote off 144 million of goodwill that resulted from the sgm acquisition and was assigned to our existing china chocolate business as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkeybranded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks this goodwill impairment was driven by the continued declining performance in our china chocolate business through the third quarter of 2015 as a result of the macroeconomic challenges mentioned previously as well as changing consumer shopping behavior in china 

in 2014 the annual impairment testing of our india reporting unit resulted in a 114 million goodwill impairment charge and a 45 million writedown of a trademark associated with the india business these impairment charges were largely a result of our decision at the time to exit the oils portion of the india business and realign our approach to regional marketing and distribution in india 

the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

business realignment activities 

we are currently pursuing several business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind key growth strategies costs recorded for business realignment activities during 2016  2015  and 2014  and their classification within the statements of income are as follows 

operational optimization program 

in the second quarter of 2016 we commenced a program the “operational optimization program” to optimize our production and supply chain network which includes select facility consolidations the program encompasses the continued transition of our china chocolate and sgm operations into a united golden hershey  platform including the integration of the china sales force as well as workforce planning efforts and the consolidation of production within certain facilities in china and north america 

we have incurred pretax costs of 88 million to date including noncash assetrelated incremental depreciation costs severance and employee benefit costs costs to consolidate and relocate production and thirdparty costs incurred to execute these activities we currently expect to incur additional cash costs of approximately 37 million over the next two years to complete this program the operational optimization program is expected to drive annual savings of approximately 52 million by 2018 

2015 productivity initiative 

in mid2015 we initiated a productivity initiative the “2015 productivity initiative” intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer to enable a more enterprisewide approach to innovation to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda and to provide for a more efficient cost structure while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas overall the 2015 productivity initiative was undertaken to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the companys ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer 

the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2015 resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300 positions with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015 for the year ended december 31 2016  we incurred charges totaling 193 million consisting of pension settlement charges adjustments to estimated severance benefits and incremental thirdparty costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure the 2015 productivity initiative was completed during the third quarter of 2016 we incurred total costs of 1250 million relating to this initiative including pension settlement charges of 137 million recorded in 2016 and 102 million recorded in 2015 relating to lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring 

or leaving the company as a result of this initiative we have realized approximately 82 million in savings since inception of the 2015 productivity initiative 

other international restructuring programs 

other costs incurred in connection with business realignment activities for the year ended december 31 2015 related principally to accelerated depreciation and amortization and employee severance costs for multiple programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain nonus manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 49 interest in hershey do brasil ltda under a cooperative agreement with pandurata netherlands bv bauducco 

mauna loa divestiture 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell the mauna loa macadamia nut corporation “mauna loa” as a result of the expected sale in 2014 we recorded an estimated loss on the anticipated sale of 223  million to reflect the disposal entity at fair value less an estimate of the selling costs the sale completed in the first quarter of 2015 resulted in an additional loss on sale of 27  million based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits 

project next century 

the 2014 costs shown relate primarily to the demolition of the company’s former manufacturing facility representing the final phase of the project next century program as of december 31 2014 we have concluded project next century 

segment operating results do not include business realignment and related costs as these initiatives are generally centrally managed and are not included within our internal measures of segment performance 

operating profit and operating profit margin 

2016  compared with 2015   

operating profit increased   162  in 2016  compared with 2015  due primarily to lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges lower sma costs and lower business realignment costs offset in part by the lower gross profit operating profit margin increased to 162 in 2016 from 140 in 2015 due primarily to these same factors 

on a nongaap basis 2016 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 24 and 40 basis points respectively reflecting the reduction in total sma costs including advertising and related consumer marketing offset in part by higher trade promotional spending 

2015  compared with 2014   

operating profit decreased 255 in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the goodwill impairment charges higher sma costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment costs offset in part by the higher gross profit operating profit margin decreased to 140 in 2015 from 188 in 2014 due to the goodwill impairment charges higher sma expenses as a percent of sales and higher business realignment costs 

on a nongaap basis 2015 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 18 and 40 basis points respectively 

interest expense net 

2016  compared with 2015   

net interest expense was 156 million   lower  in 2016  than in 2015  as the 2015 amount included the premium paid to repurchase longterm debt as part of a cash tender offer this decrease was partially offset by lower capitalized interest expense and lower interest income 

2015  compared with 2014   

net interest expense was 223 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 due primarily to the premium paid to repurchase longterm debt as part of a cash tender offer this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense coupled with savings resulting from fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements put in place toward the end of 2014 

other income expense net 

2016  compared with 2015   

other income expense net was 139 million lower in 2016 than 2015 due primarily to the 267 million settlement of the sgm liability in 2016 partially offset by an increase in the writedown of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits 

2015  compared with 2014   

other income expense net was 274 million higher in 2015 than 2014 due primarily to the writedown of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits partially offset by the gain on the sale of a noncore trademark 

income taxes and effective tax rate 

2016  compared with 2015   

our effective income tax rate was 345  for 2016  compared with 431  for 2015  the 2015 tax rate was significantly impacted by the nondeductible goodwill impairment charges excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other nongaap charges the 2016 effective income tax rate was 190 basis points lower than the 2015 rate the 2016 nongaap rate reflects greater benefit from manufacturing deductions research and development and investment tax credits and a favorable foreign rate differential relating to our cocoa procurement operations 

2015  compared with 2014   

our effective income tax rate was 431 for 2015 compared with 352 for 2014 the 2015 tax rate was significantly impacted by the nondeductible goodwill impairment charges excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other nongaap charges the 2015 effective income tax rate was 130 basis points lower than the 2014 rate the 2015 rate benefited from tax credits realized from the investment tax strategy initiated in the second quarter of 2015 which was partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the sgm net operating loss carryforwards 

net income and net income per share 

2016  compared with 2015   

net income increased  2070 million or 404  while epsdiluted increased   102  or 440  in 2016  compared with 2015  the increases in both net income and epsdiluted were driven by the lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges lower sma costs and lower business realignment costs as noted above our 2016 epsdiluted also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

on a nongaap basis net income increased 388 million in 2016  or 43 and epsdiluted increased 029 or 70 as compared with 2015  the increases in 2016 nongaap net income and nongaap epsdiluted were primarily driven by the lower sma expense as well as the lower tax rate 

2015  compared with 2014   

net income decreased 3339 million or 394 while epsdiluted decreased 145 or 385 in 2015 compared with 2014 the decreases in both net income and epsdiluted were driven by the goodwill impairment charges higher sma costs related to acquisitions and higher business realignment costs as noted above our 2015 epsdiluted benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

on a nongaap basis net income increased 138 million in 2015 or 15 and epsdiluted increased 014 or 35 as compared with 2014 the increases in 2015 nongaap net income and nongaap epsdiluted were primarily driven by gross margin expansion and lower net interest expense 

segment results 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments north america and international and other the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis for segment reporting purposes we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses unallocated marktomarket gains and losses on commodity derivatives business realignment and impairment charges acquisition integration costs nsrpei and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation segment income and segment income margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors as they exclude the activities that are not integral to our ongoing operations for further information see the nongaap information section of this mda 

our segment results including a reconciliation to our consolidated results were as follows 



 north america 

the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery market position as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions in the united states and canada this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery pantry food service and other snacking product lines north america accounted for 878  876  and 856  of our net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively north america results for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 

2016  compared with 2015   

net sales of our north america segment increased 649 million or 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting volume increases of 14 and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 07 partially offset by unfavorable net price realization of 09 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by 

approximately 02 our 2016 north america performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other cpg companies additionally the us cmg category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter easter season and merchandising and display strategies at select customers the segments volume increase was primarily attributable to new product introductions partially offset by lower everyday product sales the unfavorable net price realization resulted from increased levels of trade promotional spending necessary to support higher levels of instore merchandising and display activity our canada operations were impacted by the stronger us dollar which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact 

our north america segment income decreased 330 million or 16 in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by lower gross margin as higher trade promotional spending and higher supply chain costs were only partially offset by the benefit from supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives 

2015  compared with 2014   

net sales of our north america segment increased 1154 million or 18 in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting net price realization of 48 and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 03 substantially offset by volume declines of 25 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 08 the volume decline was due to elasticity related to the 2014 pricing action as well as lower everyday product sales which were impacted by changing consumer shopping habits such as channel shifting and ecommerce an increase in competitive activity and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace our canada operations were impacted by the stronger us dollar which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact 

our north america segment income increased 1578 million or 82 in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by gross margin expansion primarily due to favorable price realization and supply chain productivity which offset volume declines and input cost increases 

international and other 

the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture import market sell or distribute chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery and other products currently this includes our operations in china and other asia markets latin america europe africa and the middle east along with exports to these regions while a less significant component this segment also includes our global retail operations including hershey’s chocolate world stores in hershey pennsylvania new york city las vegas shanghai niagara falls ontario dubai and singapore as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world international and other accounted for 122  124  and 144  of our net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively international and other results for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



2016  compared with 2015   

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 113 million or 12 in 2016 compared to 2015   reflecting an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 44 volume declines of 37 and the unfavorable impact of net acquisitions and divestitures of 01 substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 70 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the net sales of our international and other segment increased by approximately 32 

the favorable net price realization was driven by lower direct trade expense as well as lower returns discounts and allowances in china which declined significantly compared to the prior year the volume decrease primarily related to lower sales in india due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business as well as lower sales in our global retail and licensing business partially offset by net sales increases in latin america and select export markets constant 

currency net sales in mexico and brazil increased on a combined basis by approximately 13 driven by solid chocolate marketplace performance 

our international and other segment loss decreased 690 million in 2016 compared to 2015 combined income in latin america and export markets improved versus the prior year and performance in china benefited from lower direct trade and returns discounts and allowances that were significantly lower than the prior year 

2015  compared with 2014   

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 1506 million or 141 in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting volume declines of 90 an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 62 and unfavorable net price realization of 40 partially offset by incremental revenue from the acquisition of sgm representing an increase of 51 to 2015 net sales excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the net sales of our international and other segment declined approximately 79 

the net sales decline was driven by volume declines in our china chocolate business in 2015 chocolate category growth in china was flat relative to the prior year however our 2015 chocolate retail takeaway in china declined by 11 resulting in a market share decline in china of 11 

performance in our focus markets of mexico and brazil improved and on a constant currency basis net sales in 2015 in these countries increased by approximately 6 and 3 respectively versus 2014 constant currency net sales in india declined in 2015 primarily due to the planned discontinuance of edible oil products 

our international and other segment loss was 981 million in 2015 compared to segment income of 400 million in 2014 the decline was primarily attributable to lower net sales of chocolate products in china coupled with losses at sgm as that business was also impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic conditions in china as well as incremental integrationrelated costs 

unallocated corporate expense 

unallocated corporate expense includes centrallymanaged a corporate functional costs relating to legal treasury finance and human resources b expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations including warehousing distribution and manufacturing information systems and global shared services c noncash stockbased compensation expense and d other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance 

unallocated corporate expense totaled 4974 million in both 2016 and 2015 savings realized in 2016 from our productivity and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employeerelated costs and an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization as compared to 2014 unallocated corporate expense of 5032 million the reduction in 2015 expense was driven primarily by the implementation of the 2015 productivity initiative discussed previously 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased 2310 million  relative to 2015 this decrease was driven by the following factors 

 cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased 3701 million  relative to 2014 this increase was driven by the following factors 

 pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 728 million 668 million and 373 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and 

other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 417 million 533 million and 531 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  

respectively 

investing activities 

our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property plant and equipment and capitalized software purchases of shortterm investments and acquisitions of businesses partially offset by proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment and shortterm investments we used cash of 5955 million  for investing activities in 2016  compared to 4772 million  in 2015  with the increase driven by additional business acquisition activity we used cash of 8626 million  for investing activities in 2014  which was primarily driven by additional business acquisition activity and purchases of shortterm investments 

primary investing activities include the following 

 financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options we used cash of 4344 million  for financing activities in 2016  compared to 7552 million  in 2015  with the decrease due mainly to higher proceeds from the issuance of longterm borrowings partially offset by the purchase of the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares of sgm and higher dividend payments in 2016 we used cash of 7193 million  for financing activities in 2014  primarily to fund dividend payments and share repurchases 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 



2016 we generated cash flow of 2756 million through shortterm commercial paper borrowings partially offset by payments in shortterm foreign borrowings in 2015 we generated cash flow of 107 million as a result of higher borrowings at certain of our international businesses in 2014 we generated additional cash flow from the issuance of 550 million in commercial paper as well as incremental borrowings at certain international locations in support of sales growth 

 liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 2970 million at december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3465 million our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016 declined 495 million compared to the 2015 yearend balance as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately twothirds of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016  was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states if these amounts held outside of the united states were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 30 billion at december 31 2016  and 24 billion at december 31 2015  our total debt increased in 2016 mainly due to the additional debt issued midyear to repay commercial paper that had been used to fund the ripple brand collective llc acquisition in april 2016 

as a source of shortterm financing we maintain a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase borrowings by an additional 400 million with the consent of the lenders as of december 31 2016  the termination date of this agreement is november 2020 we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions as of december 31 2016  we had 526 million of available capacity under the agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2016  

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2016  we had available capacity of 3454 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the trust established by milton s and catherine s hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school such trust the milton hershey school trust maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition a representative of hershey trust company currently serves as a member of the companys board in performing his responsibilities on the company’s board this representative may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the milton hershey school trust in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company the companys board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company as trustee for the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary 

obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps interest associated with variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward curve as of december 31 2016  

2 includes the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities 

3 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

4 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2016  the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2016  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information on recently issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past 

our trade promotional costs totaled 11574 million 11223 million and 11255 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant over the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than 3 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations our related accounting policies accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations 

 

as of december 31 2016 our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 418 million we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount which is the greater of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the expected longterm rate of investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the longterm rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 10 million 

 

pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 35 million in 2017 pension expense beyond 2017 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postemployment benefit plans 

changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

we test goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or using a twostep quantitative process if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and companyspecific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the twostep process is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for those reporting units tested using the twostep process we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash   flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

at december 31 2016  the net book value of our goodwill totaled 8123 million and related to five reporting units as it relates to our annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter no additional goodwill impairment was indicated and the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value was at least 100 for each of our tested reporting units 

in 2015 we recorded a 2808  million impairment charge resulting from our interim reassessment of the valuation of the sgm business coupled with the writedown of goodwill attributed to the china chocolate business in connection with the sgm acquisition as a result of declining performance levels and our postacquisition assessment we determined that gaap required an interim impairment test of the sgm reporting unit we performed the first step of this test as of july 5 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business the results of this test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount as of the measurement date suggesting that a goodwill impairment was probable which required us to perform a second step analysis to confirm that an impairment existed and to determine the amount of the impairment based on our reassessed value of the reporting unit although preliminary as a result of this reassessment in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated 2498 million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5 2015 during the third quarter we increased the value 

of acquired goodwill by 166 million with the corresponding offset principally represented by the establishment of additional opening balance sheet liabilities for additional commitments and contingencies that were identified through our postacquisition assessment we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit which resulted in a writeoff of this additional goodwill in the third quarter for a total impairment of 2664 million we also tested the other longlived assets of sgm for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and no impairment was indicated 

in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition we had assigned approximately 15 million of goodwill to our existing china chocolate business as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkeybranded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks as the net sales and earnings of our china business continued to be adversely impacted by macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior through the third quarter of 2015 we determined that an interim impairment test of the goodwill in this reporting unit was also required we performed the first step of this test in the third quarter of 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business the results of this test suggested that a goodwill impairment was probable and the conclusions of the second step analysis resulted in a writedown of 144 million representing the full value of goodwill attributed to this reporting unit as of october 4 2015 we also tested the other longlived assets of the china asset group for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and no impairment was indicated 

during our 2014 annual testing the fair value of our india reporting unit approximated its carrying value as a result and given the sensitivity of the india impairment analysis to changes in the underlying assumptions we performed a step two analysis which indicated a goodwill impairment of 114 million in addition our 2014 annual test of indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in a 45 million pretax writedown of a trademark also associated with the india business also in 2014 in connection with the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 we recorded estimated impairment charges totaling 185 million to writedown goodwill and an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset based on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreedupon sales price 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

in order to manage interest rate exposure we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements including fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions and forward starting interest rate swap agreements to reduce interest volatility associated with certain anticipated debt issues when utilized the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of these swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  was 350 million and 850 million respectively we had one forward starting interest rate swap agreement in a cash flow hedging relationship with a notional amount of 500 million at december 31 2015 this interest rate swap agreement was settled in connection with the issuance of debt in august 2016 resulting in a payment of approximately 87 million which is reflected within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows the notional amount at december 31 2016 and 2015 includes 350 million of fixedtofloating interest rate swaps that convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this now variablerate debt as of december 31 2016 would have increased interest expense by approximately 36 million for the full year 2016 and 2015 respectively 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable rates with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 by approximately 142 million and 76 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2016  and 2015  the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of 14 million and a liability of 01 million respectively assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 96 million and 32 million respectively 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it can be difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2016 average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with 2015 and traded in a range between 103 and 138 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract cocoa production was lower during the 2015 to 2016 crop year and global demand was slightly higher which produced a small reduction in global cocoa stocks over the past year despite the slight decrease in global cocoa inventories prices started to decline in 

response to expectations that future cocoa supply increases were going to outpace demand and rebuild global stocks during the subsequent crop year 

the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

during 2016 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 013 per pound to a high of 015 per pound on a class iv milk basis dairy prices were lower than 2015 driven by increased production in europe and the united states as well as larger dairy product inventories globally 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the united states are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market united states delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from 033 to 039 per pound during 2016 

peanut prices in the united states began the year around 046 per pound and closed the year at 065 per pound drought conditions throughout 2016 in the key southeast peanut growing region resulted in an estimated 5 smaller crop versus the 2015 crop and drove price increases almond prices began the year at 353 per pound and decreased to 284 per pound during 2016 almond supply is ample to support us demand heading into 2017 as the 2016 crop is expected to be approximately 11 larger than the 2015 crop source almond board of california  

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 7394 million as of december 31 2016 and 3748 million as of december 31 2015 at the end of 2016 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2016 by 739 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery we market sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide 

reportable segments 

our organizational structure is designed to ensure continued focus on north america coupled with an emphasis on accelerating growth in our focus international markets as we continue to transform into a more global company our business is organized around geographic regions which enables us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets the presidents of our geographic regions along with the senior vice president responsible for our global retail and licensing business are accountable for delivering our annual financial plans and report into our ceo who serves as our chief operating decision maker “codm” so we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis our north america business currently generates over 87 of our consolidated revenue and none of our other geographic regions is individually significant therefore we currently define our reportable segments as follows 

 financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

business acquisitions and divestitures 

in march 2015 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of krave pure foods inc “krave” manufacturer of krave jerky a leading allnatural snack brand of premium jerky products the transaction was undertaken to enable us to tap into the rapidly growing meat snacks category and further expand into the broader snacks space 

in september 2015 we acquired the noncontrolling 49 interest in hershey do brasil giving us 100 ownership of this business 

in september 2014 we completed the acquisition of 80 of the outstanding shares of shanghai golden monkey food joint stock co ltd “sgm” a confectionery company based in shanghai china whose product line is primarily sold through traditional trade channels the acquisition was undertaken in order to leverage these traditional trade channels which complement our traditional china chocolate business which is primarily distributed through tier 1 or hypermarket channels as discussed throughout 2015 sgm’s declining performance levels and the results of our assessment of the quality of sgm’s accounts receivables and existing distributor networks indicated the need to test the goodwill arising from the sgm acquisition for impairment and ultimately resulted in the recording of a 2808 

million impairment charge as of the end of the third quarter 2015 we are directing our efforts currently on developing an integration plan that is focused on the optimal structure for topline growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 we entered into an agreement redefining the terms of acquisition for the remaining 20 of sgm which remained subject to regulatory approval as of yearend we completed the purchase of the remaining 20 on february 3 2016 

in 2014 we also acquired all of the outstanding shares of the allan candy company limited “allan” headquartered in ontario canada and a controlling interest in lotte shanghai food company a joint venture established in 2007 in china for the purpose of manufacturing and selling product to the joint venture partners these acquisitions provide us with additional manufacturing and distribution capacity to serve primarily the north america and asia markets respectively 

in march 2015 we completed the sale of mauna loa macadamia nut corporation “mauna loa” 

products 

our principal confectionery offerings include chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery products gum and mint refreshment products pantry items such as baking ingredients toppings and beverages and snack items such as spreads meat snacks bars and snack bites and mixes 

 principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2015  approximately 26  of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african central and south american regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii fluid dairy milk peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation costs and employee benefits when we implement price increases there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service 

seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks the trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the us and other key international markets where our products are sold we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s  and reese’s  brand names 

furthermore we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 



research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries including the united states mexico brazil india and china we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of commerce and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the united states 

we believe our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate the supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety various government agencies and thirdparty firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations 

we make routine operating and capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations these annual expenditures are not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 19060 fulltime and 1650 parttime employees worldwide collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 5930 employees during 2016  agreements will be negotiated for certain employees at four facilities outside of the united states comprising approximately 73 of total employees under collective bargaining agreements we believe that our employee relations are generally good 

financial information by geographic area 

our principal operations and markets are located in the united states the percentage of total consolidated net sales for our businesses outside of the united states was 172  for 2015  192  for 2014  and 184  for 2013  the percentage of total longlived assets outside of the united states was 318  as of december 31 2015  and 313  as of december 31 2014

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if 

we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 26  of our total net sales in 2015  mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations we continue to experience increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately twothirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 



we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

during 2015 we faced a number of challenges in connection with the ongoing integration of sgm since its acquisition in 2014 the sgm business has performed below expectations with net sales and earnings well below preacquisition levels in addition issues with the quality of sgm’s accounts receivables and existing distributor networks have affected our ability to fully realize many of the acquisition benefits that we believe will help accelerate our growth in china and enhance our ability to serve chinese consumers as a result of sgms poor performance and these other contributing factors in the second and third quarters of 2015 we recorded a goodwill writedown of approximately 266 million representing all of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit while we believe we have appropriate strategies in place that will allow us to accelerate the sgm integration in 2016 additional challenges that impede further integration could jeopardize our growth strategy in china and could have a negative impact on the results of operations and cash flows of our international and other reportable segment 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained 

global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

our expanding international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2015  we derived approximately 17  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states versus 19  in 2014 and 18  in 2013 additionally approximately 32  of our total longlived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2015  as part of our global growth strategy we have made investments outside of the united states particularly china and asia mexico and brazil as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards 

we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

we might not be able to hire engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies 

our people continue to be our most important asset and our future success depends upon our ability to identify hire develop engage and retain talented personnel across the globe competition for global talent is intense and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business in particular if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill the new senior management positions created as a result of the productivity initiative we announced in june 2015 our business performance may be impacted 

activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 

in addition to hiring new employees we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets channels and categories this may require significant investments in training coaching and other career development and retention activities if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected which may impact our financial condition and results of operations

the mda is organized in the following sections 

 overview and outlook 

we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery we market sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide we report our operations through two segments north america and international and other 

we continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives in 2015 including margin expansion in our north america segment which fuels our earnings per share and enables us to make investments in other parts of the business a demonstrated commitment to transparency and simple ingredients to satisfy evolving consumer preferences additional investments in our snacks business and a continued focus on insights and knowledge to identify and respond to changing consumer and retail trends and practices 

our 2015 financial performance was impacted by a continued slowdown in us retail takeaway an increase in competitive activity and poor performance in china for the full year 2015 our us cmg retail takeaway increased 24 which was largely in line with the category growth rate but continues to be down from longterm historical average of 34 we believe the category is being impacted by changing consumer shopping habits like channel shifting and ecommerce increased competitive activity and higher levels of merchandising and display and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace which appears to be adversely impacting purchases of nonseasonal candy products 

our shanghai golden monkey “sgm” business has performed below expectations since its initial acquisition in 2014 with net sales and earnings levels well below preacquisition levels in addition as part of our ongoing integration process we assessed the quality of sgm’s accounts receivable and existing distributor networks based on the declining performance levels and the results of our integration assessments we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 5 2015 which resulted in a preliminary 2498 million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5 2015 during the third quarter we updated our estimates of the acquisitiondate fair values of the net assets acquired which increased the value of acquired goodwill by 166 million we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit which resulted in a writeoff of this additional goodwill for a total impairment of 2664 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached an agreement with the selling sgm shareholders to reduce the originallyagreed purchase price for the remaining 20  of sgm and we completed the purchase on february 3 2016 we are directing our efforts currently on developing an integration plan that is focused on the optimal structure for topline growth 

macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior adversely impacted our china chocolate business during 2015 the china chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical compound annual growth rate of 1112 as marketplace trends continue to slow across all channels as a result of the declining 

performance in our china chocolate business during the third quarter we also wroteoff 144 million of goodwill that resulted from the sgm acquisition and was assigned to our existing china chocolate business as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkeybranded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks in light of the declining results in our china business and challenges impacting the overall retail landscape in asia we will continue to assess the impact of potential excess capacity on the carrying value of our longlived assets in the asia region 

in june we announced a new productivity initiative intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance our ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer in 2015 we incurred charges totaling 1058 million representing employee severance and related separation benefits pension settlement charges and incremental thirdparty costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure excluding pension settlement charges we currently estimate total pretax charges and costs for the program to be approximately 120 million the majority of which are cash the remaining costs for this program are expected to be incurred within the first three quarters of 2016 

giving consideration to the aforementioned impacts our 2015 net sales decreased 05 to 73866 million in 2015 from 74218 million in 2014 while our net income and earnings per sharediluted declined by 394 and 385 respectively excluding a 16 impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates our net sales increased 11 on a nongaap basis our net income increased by 15 driven by positive us gross margin expansion while our nongaap eps also benefited from recent share buybacks increasing a total of 35 

entering 2016 we expect changing shopping habits in the us and volatile international markets to remain a headwind despite these issues we will continue to invest in our core brands in the us and key international markets and build on the strategies we have established as they will benefit the company over the long term we also plan to make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform to drive additional growth these initiatives should enable us to achieve net sales and earnings growth we expect to achieve longterm net sales growth of 35 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and given the scale advantages of our north america business and a balanced approach to international investments we expect to generate longterm nongaap earnings per sharediluted growth of 68 

for 2016 we expect net sales growth of approximately 3 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which is estimated to be approximately 10 unfavorable north america net sales are expected to be driven by confectionery and snacks growth including  krave meat snacks distribution gains we have many exciting new products that will bring variety news and excitement to the category including reese’s  snack mix and hershey’s  snack bites canisters cadbury  chocolates in a standup pouch targeting the mass premium market and the introduction of allan candy sugar confectionery peg bag items and some other yet to be announced new candy and snacking products we expect gross margin to approximate the 2015 level and are focused on managing nonessential selling marketing and administrative as we continue to leverage existing resources additionally implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in june is on track and we will continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing including a greater shift to digital and mobile communication as a result we expect 2016 fullyear reported earnings per sharediluted to improve significantly on the basis of lower unusual charges and adjusted earnings per sharediluted to increase approximately 6 as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2016 that follows 

our 2016 outlook reflects information currently available to us however it is subject to risks and uncertainties particularly pertaining to the macroeconomic uncertainties and evolving consumer dynamics in china while further volatility could evolve in that market we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated cash flows or financial position 

nongaap information 

the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by business realignment charges including the 2015 productivity initiative asset impairment charges costs relating to business and asset acquisitions and disposals loss on early extinguishment of debt and nonservice related components of our pension expense income 

to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance we use nongaap financial measures within mda that exclude the financial impact of these activities these nongaap financial measures are used by management in evaluating results of operations internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures referenced in mda to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below 



in the assessment of our results we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the reported and nongaap financial measures presented above 



 

details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the nongaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows 

2015 productivity initiative 

in june 2015 we announced a new productivity initiative which is intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer to enable a more enterprisewide approach to innovation to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda and to provide for a more efficient cost structure while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas the project is intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the companys ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer we recorded pretax charges related to this program of 1057 million for the year ended december 31 2015 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

other business realignment activities 

we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance longterm profitability for the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded pretax charges of 126 million relating to programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain nonus manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our purchase of the noncontrolling interest from our joint venture partner for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we incurred pretax charges of 120 million and 191 million respectively primarily relating to the demolition of the companys former manufacturing facility representing the final phase of the project next century program this program was substantially complete as of december 31 2014 

  

acquisition and integration costs 

for the year ended december 31 2015 we incurred costs related to integration of the 2014 acquisitions of sgm and allan candy and the 2015 acquisition of krave totaling 225 million as we incorporate these businesses into our operating practices and information systems this includes charges incurred to writedown approximately 64 million of expired or nearexpiration workinprocess inventory at sgm in connection with the implementation of our global quality standards and practices in addition integration costs for the year were benefited by a 68 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration paid to the krave shareholders for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we incurred pretax acquisition and integration costs of 133 million and charges of 41 million respectively the 2014 and 2013 charges were largely related to sgm acquisition and integration costs the 2014 charges were also offset by a 46 million gain relating to the acquisition of a controlling interest in lotte shanghai food company 

nonservice related pension expense income 

nonservicerelated pension expense income includes interest costs the expected return on pension plan assets the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits the nonservicerelated pension expense income can fluctuate from yeartoyear as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from yeartoyear therefore we exclude the nonservicerelated pension expense income from our internal performance measures our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants in 2007 resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable we recorded pretax nonservice related pension expense income of 181 million 18 million and 109 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2015 expense adjustment includes approximately 96 million in settlement charges relating to lumpsum distributions to participants that did not separate in connection with the 2015 productivity initiative settlement charges relating to individuals separating in connection with the 2015 productivity initiative are included within the “2015 productivity initiative” costs noted above 

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 

as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the second and third quarters of 2015 we recorded a total 2808 million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill resulting from the sgm acquisition including 144 million relating to the portion of goodwill that had been allocated to our china chocolate reporting unit based on synergies to be realized by this business for the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges totaling 159 million associated with our business in india 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

in 2015 we recorded within interest expense a pretax loss on early extinguishment of debt of 283 million relating to a cash tender offer see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

loss on mauna loa divestiture 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell mauna loa at which time the entity was recorded as held for sale and we recorded an estimated loss of 223 million to reflect the disposal entity at its fair value less an estimate of the selling costs the transaction closed in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in the recording of an additional loss on sale of 27 million based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits 

gain on sale of trademark 

in 2015 we recorded a 99 million gain relating to the sale of a noncore trademark 

2016 outlook 

the following table provides a reconciliation of projected 2016 earnings per sharediluted prepared in accordance with gaap to projected nongaap earnings per sharediluted for 2016 prepared on a nongaap basis with adjustments consistent to those discussed previously the reconciliation of 2015 and 2014 earnings per sharediluted prepared in accordance with gaap to 2015 and 2015 nongaap earnings per sharediluted is provided below for comparison 



our 2016 projected earnings per sharediluted as presented above does not include the impact of marktomarket gains and losses on our commodity derivative contracts that will be reflected within corporate unallocated expenses in our segment results until the related inventory is sold pursuant to our revised accounting policy for commodity derivatives as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

consolidated results of operations 



net sales 

2015  compared with 2014   

net sales decreased   05  in 2015  compared with 2014  reflecting volume declines of 34 and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 16 substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 35 as well as a 10 benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures the favorable net price realization primarily in the us was attributed to the price increase announced in mid2014 the volume declines were attributed to volume elasticity relating to the pricing action in the us as well as lower everyday product sales given the challenging shopper environment in north america coupled with lower sales in china excluding foreign currency our net sales increased 11 in 2015 

2014  compared with 2013   

net sales increased 39 in 2014 compared with 2013 reflecting volume growth of 44 and favorable net price realization of 02 offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 07 the volume growth was driven by incremental sales of new products in our north america and international and other segments coupled with almost 1 of growth from the recent sgm acquisition the pricing benefit from the 2014 midyear price increase was largely offset by higher trade promotions and lower core volumes associated with nearterm volume elasticity related to the price increase 

key us marketplace metrics 



consumer takeaway and the change in market share are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution primarily include food drug mass merchandisers and convenience store channels plus walmart stores inc partial dollar club and military channels 

these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category in 2015 the category and hershey growth rates continue to be impacted by changing consumer shopping habits and increased levels of distribution and instore activity of items such as salty bakery and meat snacks by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers which has been driving broader snacking category growth in 2014 and 2015 despite these market dynamics for the full year 2015 our us cmg retail takeaway increased 24 which was in line with category growth our market share decreased by 10 basis points however we maintained an industry leading 313 us market share 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2015  compared with 2014   

cost of sales decreased   20  in 2015  compared with 2014  supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced cost of sales by approximately 66 these declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 41 in addition cost of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of 73 million business realignment charges of 88 million and nonservice related pension expense of 25 million which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 05 in comparison cost of sales benefited by 11 million in 2014 primarily due to nonservice related pension income 

gross margin increased  by 80  basis points in 2015  compared with 2014  favorable net price realization as well as supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points however these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable sales mix which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points on a nongaap basis excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis points 

2014  compared with 2013   

cost of sales increased 57 in 2014 compared with 2013 higher costs associated with sales volume increases higher commodity and other incremental supply chain costs and unfavorable sales mix increased total cost of sales by approximately 78 the higher commodity costs were largely driven by higher dairy ingredient costs which cannot be effectively hedged while the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a greater proportion of seasonal sales volumes which are typically at lower margins than nonseasonal products these cost increases were offset in part by supply chain productivity improvements and lower pension costs which together reduced cost of sales by approximately 21 

gross margin decreased by 90 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013 supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives favorable net price realization and operating leverage from the higher sales volumes collectively improved gross margin by 150 basis points the impact of lower pension expenses in 2014 in comparison with 2013 benefited 2014 gross margin by 20 basis points however these benefits were more than offset by higher commodity and other input costs and unfavorable sales mix which together reduced gross profit margin by approximately 260 basis points 

selling marketing and administrative 

2015  compared with 2014   

selling marketing and administrative “sma” expenses increased   709 million  or 37  in 2015  advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 10 during this period excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs selling and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 67 as compared to 2014 driven by incremental increases from acquired businesses excluding the impact of acquisition costs sma expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued focus on nonessential spending sma expenses in 2015 were also 

impacted by charges of 136 million attributed to the 2015 productivity initiative acquisition and integration costs of 136 million nonservice related pension expense of 156 million and other business realignment charges of 37 million in 2014 sma expenses included acquisition and integration costs of 124 million other business realignment charges of 29 million and nonservice related pension expense of 09 million 

2014  compared with 2013   

sma expenses decreased 257 million or 13 in 2014 this includes a 31 reduction in advertising and related consumer marketing expenses due to the timing of new product launches a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas excluding advertising and related consumer marketing expenses selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat compared to 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs and discretionary cost containment efforts offset in part by higher employeerelated costs including additional headcount in our china business and additional focused selling resources as well as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of sgm selling and administrative expenses in 2014 also benefited from the 56 million in foreign currency gains realized on forward contracts related to the manufacturing facility under construction in johor malaysia 

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

as discussed in the overview and outlook section as well as note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the sgm business performed below expectations throughout 2015 with net sales and earnings levels well below preacquisition levels as of result of this declining performance in the second quarter we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of 2498 million relating to the sgm reporting unit during the third quarter we updated our estimates of the acquisitiondate fair values of the net assets acquired which increased the value of acquired goodwill by 166 million we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit which resulted in an additional 166 million writeoff of this increase to goodwill during the third quarter we also wrote off 144 million of goodwill that resulted from the sgm acquisition and was assigned to our existing china chocolate business as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkeybranded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks this goodwill impairment was driven by the continued declining performance in our china chocolate business through the third quarter as a result of macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior mentioned previously 

in 2014 the annual impairment testing of our india reporting unit resulted in a 114 million goodwill impairment charge and a 45 million pretax writedown of a trademark associated with the india business these impairment charges were largely a result of our decision to exit the oils portion of the india business and realign our approach to regional marketing and distribution in india 

the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

business realignment charges 

expenses recorded for business realignment activities during 2015  2014  and 2013  and their classification within the statements of income are as follows 



2015 productivity initiative 

on june 19 2015 we announced a new productivity initiative the “2015 productivity initiative” intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer to enable a more enterprisewide approach to innovation to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda and to provide for a more efficient cost structure while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas overall the 2015 initiative is intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the companys ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer 

the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300  positions with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015 for the year  ended december 31 2015  we incurred charges totaling 1057 million representing employee severance and related separation benefits as well as incremental thirdparty costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure this also includes a pension settlement cost of 102 million relating to lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company as a result of the 2015 productivity initiative 

total pretax charges and costs for this program are expected to be approximately 120 million  the majority of which are cash this excludes the 2015 pension settlement costs and any additional pension settlement costs that could be triggered by additional lump sum withdrawals in 2016 the remaining costs are expected to be incurred within the first three quarters of 2016 

other international restructuring programs 

other 2015 charges for business realignment activities relate principally to accelerated depreciation and amortization and employee severance costs for programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain nonus manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our purchase of the noncontrolling interest from our joint venture partner remaining costs relating to these programs are not expected to be significant 

divestiture of mauna loa 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell the mauna loa macadamia nut corporation “mauna loa” 

as a result of the expected sale in 2014 we recorded an estimated loss on the anticipated sale of 223  million to reflect the disposal entity at fair value less an estimate of the selling costs the sale was completed in the first quarter of 2015 resulted in an additional loss on sale of 27  million based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits 

next century program 

the 2014 and 2013 charges shown above relate primarily to the demolition of the companys former manufacturing facility representing the final phase of the project next century program “next century program” this program was substantially complete as of december 31 2014 

the restructuring charges discussed above for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 relate predominantly to initiatives undertaken by the north america segment with the exception of the international programs which relate to the international and other segment segment operating results do not include business realignment and related charges as these initiatives are generally centrally managed and are not included within our internal measures of segment performance 

operating profit and operating profit margin 

2015  compared with 2014   

operating profit decreased   255  in 2015  compared with 2014  due primarily to the goodwill impairment charges higher selling marketing and administrative costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment charges offset in part by the higher gross profit 

operating profit margin decreased to 140 in 2015 from 188 in 2014 due to the goodwill impairment charges higher selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percent of sales and higher business realignment charges 

on a nongaap basis 2015 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 18 and 40 basis points respectively 

2014  compared with 2013   

operating profit increased 41 in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the higher level of gross profit and lower overall selling marketing and administrative costs offset in part by higher business realignment and impairment charges in 2014 

operating profit margin increased to 188 in 2014 from 187 in 2013 due to lower sma expenses as a percent of sales partially offset by higher business realignment and impairment charges 

interest expense net 

2015  compared with 2014   

net interest expense was 223 million   higher  in 2015  than in 2014  due primarily to the premium paid to repurchase longterm debt as part of a cash tender offer this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense coupled with savings resulting from fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements put in place towards the end of 2014 

2014  compared with 2013   

net interest expense was 49 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 due primarily to a greater level of capitalized interest in 2014 as well as higher interest income earned on shortterm investments 

other income expense net 

2015  compared with 2014   

other income expense net was 274 million higher in 2015 than 2014 due primarily to the writedown of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits partially offset by the gain on the sale of a noncore trademark 

2014  compared with 2013   

other income expense net reflected a net expense of 27 million in 2014 compared to a net gain of 16 million in 2013 due primarily to the foreign exchange loss related to our strategy to cap the us denominated acquisition price of sgm offset in part by the gain realized on the acquisition of a controlling interest in lotte shanghai food company 

income taxes and effective tax rate 

2015  compared with 2014   

our effective income tax rate was 431  for 2015  compared with 352  for 2014  the 2015 tax rate was significantly impacted by the nondeductible goodwill impairment charges excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other nongaap charges the 2015 effective income tax rate was 130 basis points lower than the 2014 rate the 2015 rate benefited from tax credits realized from the investment tax strategy initiated in the second quarter of 2015 which was partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the sgm net operating loss carryforwards 

2014  compared with 2013   

our effective income tax rate was 352 for 2014 compared with 344 for 2013 the 2014 effective income tax rate was higher due to unfavorable tax return trueup adjustments unfavorable shifts of taxable income to higher tax jurisdictions and the impact of business realignment and impairment charges with minimal tax benefit partly offset by favorable settlement of canadian assessments and favorable settlement of us audits 

net income and net income per share 

2015  compared with 2014   

net income decreased   3339 million  or 394  while earnings per sharediluted “eps” decreased   145  or 385  in 2015  compared with 2014  the decreases in both net income and eps were driven by the goodwill impairment charges higher selling marketing and administrative costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment charges as noted above our 2015 eps also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

on a nongaap basis net income increased 138 million in 2015 or 15 and eps increased 014 or 35 as compared with 2014 the increases in 2015 nongaap net income and eps were primarily driven by gross margin expansion and lower net interest expense 

2014  compared with 2013   

net income increased 264 million or 32 while epsdiluted increased 016 or 44 in 2014 compared with 2013 the increases in both net income and eps were driven by higher sales offset by higher commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix as noted above our 2014 eps also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

on a nongaap basis net income increased 516 million in 2015 or 61 and eps increased 026 or 70 as compared with 2013 the increases in 2014 nongaap net income and eps were primarily driven by lower selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 

segment results 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments north america and international and other the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis for segment reporting purposes we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses as well as business realignment initiatives goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs the nonservice related portion of pension expense and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance these items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for internal management reporting and performance evaluation segment income and segment income margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors as they exclude the activities that are not integral to our ongoing operations for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the beginning of this item 7 

our segment results including a reconciliation to our consolidated results were as follows 



 29 

north america 

the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery market position as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions in the united states and canada this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery pantry food service and other snacking product lines north america accounted for 876 856 and 868 of our net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively north america results for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were as follows 

2015  compared with 2014   

net sales of our north america segment increased 1154 million or 18 in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting net price realization of 48 and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 03 substantially offset by volume declines of 25 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 08 the volume decline was due to elasticity related to the 2014 pricing action as well as lower everyday product sales which have been impacted by changing consumer shopping habits such as channel shifting and ecommerce an increase in competitive activity and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace our canada operations were impacted by the stronger us dollar which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact 

our north america segment income increased 1578 million or 82 in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by gross margin expansion primarily due to favorable price realization and supply chain productivity which offset volume declines and input cost increases 

2014  compared with 2013   

net sales of our north america segment increased 1526 million or 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting volume growth of 24 net price realization of 05 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 04 2014 new product introductions including york and kit kat  minis nutrageous relaunch brookside  crunchy clusters lancaster  soft cremes and hersheys  spreads drove the volume growth as sales volumes for core everyday products were unfavorably impacted by increased levels of distribution and instore activity from confection and other snacking categories higher levels of trade promotion reduced the benefit from the 2014 midyear pricing action our canada operations were impacted by the stronger us dollar which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact 

our north america segment income increased 536 million or 29 in 2014 compared to 2013 principally due to higher sales volumes and supply chain productivity improvements which offset input cost increases and unfavorable sales mix our core product mix in 2014 was more heavily weighted toward seasonal offerings which typically generate lower margins than our core everyday instant consumable products additionally advertising consumer promotions and marketing expenses decreased 28 in 2014 due to the timing of new product launches a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas 

international and other 

the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture import market sell or distribute chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery and other products currently this includes our operations in china and other asia markets latin america europe africa and the middle east along with exports to these regions while a less significant component this segment also includes our global retail operations including hershey’s chocolate world stores in hershey pennsylvania new york city chicago las vegas shanghai niagara falls ontario dubai and singapore as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world international and other accounted for 124 144 and 132 of our net 

sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively international and other results for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were as follows 



2015  compared with 2014   

net sales of our international and other segment decreased 1506 million or 141 in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting volume declines of 90 the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 62 and unfavorable net price realization of 40 partially offset by incremental revenue from the acquisition of sgm representing an increase of 51 to 2015 net sales excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the net sales of our international and other segment declined approximately 79 

the net sales decline was driven by volume declines in our china chocolate business in 2015 chocolate category growth in china was flat relative to the prior year however our 2015 chocolate retail takeaway in china declined by 11 resulting in a market share decline in china of 11 we believe that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior as accelerated ecommerce and online purchases of broader consumer staples are leading to lower trips to tier 1 hypermarkets where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived adversely impacting the impulseoriented chocolate category 

performance in our focus markets of mexico and brazil improved and on a constant currency basis net sales in 2015 in these countries increased by approximately 6 and 3 respectively versus 2014 constant currency net sales in india declined in 2015 primarily due to the planned discontinuance of edible oil products 

our international and other segment loss was 981 million in 2015 compared to segment income of 400 million in 2014 the decline was primarily attributable to lower net sales of chocolate products in china coupled with losses at sgm as that business has also been impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic conditions in china as well as incremental integrationrelated costs 

2014  compared with 2013   

net sales of our international and other segment increased 1231 million or 130 in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting volume growth of 170 unfavorable net price realization of 17 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 23 the sales volume increase was primarily due to increased demand for new and existing products in china as well as 54 million of incremental sales from the newly acquired sgm business excluding sgm our 2014 chocolate net sales grew 35 in china and we increased our market share to almost 10 of the chocolate category our 2014 sales in mexico were unfavorably impacted by the challenging economic environment while our brazil performance improved sequentially as the year progressed finishing 2014 up approximately 7 from the prior year excluding the impact of unfavorable currency the unfavorable price realization reflects increased trade promotions and allowances particularly in china and mexico where we have made additional investments to drive sales volume growth 

our international and other segment income decreased 46 million or 103 in 2014 compared to 2013 as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher trade promotions and a 59 higher investment in advertising to support core brands and the introduction of new products in our international markets the most significant portion of this investment was focused on our china and mexico markets we also increased headcount particularly in china in support of sales growth 

unallocated corporate items 

unallocated corporate administration includes centrallymanaged a corporate functional costs relating to legal treasury finance and human resources b expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations including warehousing distribution and manufacturing information systems and global shared services c noncash stockbased compensation expense and d other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance 

in 2015 unallocated corporate items totaled 4974 million compared to 5032 million in 2014 with the reduction driven primarily by the implementation of the 2015 productivity initiative discussed previously 

in 2014 unallocated corporate items totaled 5032 million compared to 5351 million in 2013 with the reduction driven by lower incentive compensation expense as well as discretionary cost containment measures intended to mitigate the higher commodity and other input costs in 2014 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased 3700 million relative to 2014 this increase was driven by the following factors 

 cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased 3470 million as compared to 2013 primarily due to a 140 million incremental investment in working capital to support the high sales volumes partially offset by increased net earnings in 2014 derivative activities had a 78 million unfavorable impact on 2014 operating cash flow and 101 million favorable impact on 2013 operating cash flow 

pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 668 million 373 million and 550 million 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses the 2015 costs also include net settlement and curtailment charges of 224 million that were triggered by the 2015 productivity initiative 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 533 million 531 million and 572 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 

respectively 

investing activities 

our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property plant and equipment and capitalized software purchases of shortterm investments and acquisitions of businesses partially offset by proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment and shortterm investments we used cash of 4772 million for investing activities in 2015 compared to 8626 million in 2014 with the decrease driven by less business acquisition activity and proceeds from the sale of short term investments we used cash of 3516 million for investing activities in 2013 which was primarily driven by capital expenditures relating to the malaysia facility and the next century program 

primary investing activities include the following 

 financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options we used cash of 7552 million for financing activities in 2015 compared to 7193 million in 2014 with the increase due mainly to higher dividend payments and repayments of long term debt and short term borrowings offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of long term borrowings our cash used in 2014 exceeded our cash used for financing activities in 2013 by 2727 million primarily due to higher dividend payments and share repurchases 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 

 34 

2014 this includes purchases pursuant to authorized programs of 4025 million to purchase 42 million shares in 2015 and 2023 million to purchase 21 million shares in 2014 we had no share repurchases under these programs in 2013 as of december 31 2015 approximately 20 million remained available under the 250 million share repurchase authorization approved by the board in february 2015 in january 2016 our board of directors approved an additional 500 million share repurchase authorization to commence after the existing 2015 authorization is completed 

 liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2015 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3465 million at december 31 2014 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3749 million and we held shortterm investments in the form of term deposits with original maturities of oneyear totaling 971 million in total our cash and shortterm investment holdings at the end of 2015 declined 1255 million compared to the 2014 yearend balance as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately half of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states if these amounts held outside of the united states were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 24 billion at december 31 2015 and 22 billion at december 31 2014 our total debt increased in 2015 mainly due to the additional debt issued midyear to repay commercial paper that had been used to fund the krave acquisition in the first quarter of 2015 

in october 2011 we entered into a fiveyear agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to 11 billion with an option to increase borrowings by an additional 400 million with the consent of the lenders in november 2013 this agreement was amended to reduce the amount of borrowings available under the unsecured revolving credit facility to 10 billion maintain the option to increase borrowings by an additional 400 million with the consent of the lenders and extend the termination date to november 2018 as of december 31 2015 the termination date of this agreement has been extended to november 2020 as of december 31 2015 10 billion was available to borrow under the agreement and no borrowings were outstanding the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2015 we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2015 we had available capacity of 2034 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b common stock “class b stock” holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition hershey trust company currently has three representatives who are members of the companys board one of whom is the lead independent director these representatives from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and that the company board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015 



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps interest associated with variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward curve as of december 31 2015 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities and certain equipment we do not have material capital lease obligations 

3 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

4 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2015 the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2015 nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded primarily in 2012 and included in business realignment and impairment charges the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material with regard to other facilities we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past 

our trade promotional costs totaled 11223 million 11255 million and 9957 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant over the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than approximately 3 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations 

the net periodic benefit costs relating to our pension and opeb plans were as follows 



1 we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after 2007 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2016  is 352 million the 2015  recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 305 million 

the weightedaverage assumptions for our pension and opeb plans were as follows 



to determine the expected return on our pension plan assets we consider the current asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical average return over the 28 years prior to december 31 2015 was approximately 83 the actual return on assets was 23 84 and 167 for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our investment policies specify target allocation percentages for each asset class the current estimated asset return is based upon the following targeted asset allocation for our domestic pension plans as of december 31 2015 



sensitivity of assumptions 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses the discount rate used for our pension and opeb plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans a 100 basis point decline in the weighted average pension discount rate would increase net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 47 million a decrease in the opeb discount rate by 100 basis points would decrease annual opeb expense by approximately 05 million for the opeb plans a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the postretirement benefit obligation 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since certain of our defined benefit pension plans are partially funded for 2016 we reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 61 from the 63 assumption used in 2015 to reflect lower expected longterm returns due to slowing growth in developed and emerging markets the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the rate of return for pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 110 million 

for yearend 2015 we adopted the society of actuaries updated rp2014 mortality tables with mp2015 generational projection scales however adoption of these tables did not have a significant impact on our pension obligations or net period benefit cost since our primary plans are cash balance plans and most participants take lumpsum settlements upon retirement 

funding 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by erisa federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans the annual minimum cash funding requirements for our plans are not material however we made contributions of 329 million in 2015  and 294 million in 2014  including 229 million in 2015 and 220 million in 2014  to maintain the funded status of our domestic plans as well as contributions to pay benefits under our nonqualified pension plans in both years these contributions were fully tax deductible we expect to make additional contributions of approximately 185 million to our domestic plans in 2016 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

we use a twostep process to quantitatively evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for 

similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

as discussed in note 2 based on the declining performance levels and the results of our postacquisition assessment we determined that an interim impairment test of the sgm reporting unit was required by us generally accepted accounting principles we performed the first step of this test as of july 5 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business the results of this test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount as of the measurement date suggesting that a goodwill impairment was probable which required us to perform a second step analysis to confirm that an impairment existed and to determine the amount of the impairment based on our reassessed value of the reporting unit although preliminary as a result of this reassessment in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated 2498 million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing a writedown of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5 2015 during the third quarter we increased the value of acquired goodwill by 166 million with the corresponding offset principally represented by the establishment of additional opening balance sheet liabilities for additional commitments and contingencies that were identified through our postacquisition assessment we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit which resulted in a writeoff of this additional goodwill in the third quarter for a total impairment of 2664 million we also tested the other longlived assets of sgm for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and no impairment was indicated 

in connection with the sgm acquisition we assigned approximately 15 million of goodwill to our existing china chocolate business as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkeybranded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks as the net sales and earnings of our china business continued to be adversely impacted by macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior through the third quarter we determined that an interim impairment test of the goodwill in this reporting unit was also required we performed the first step of this test in the third quarter of 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business the results of this test suggested that a goodwill impairment was probable and the conclusions of the second step analysis resulted in a writedown of 144 million representing the full value of goodwill attributed to this reporting unit as of october 4 2015 we also tested the other longlived assets of the china asset group for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and no impairment was indicated 

at december 31 2015  after considering the impairments noted above the remaining net book value of our goodwill totaled 6843 million and related to seven reporting units as it relates to our annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter no additional goodwill impairment was indicated and the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value was at least 50 for each of our tested reporting units with the exception of our krave reporting unit which includes goodwill of 1471 million this reporting unit comprises a recently acquired business whose estimated fair value approximates its carrying value 

during our 2014 annual testing the fair value of our india reporting unit approximated its carrying value as a result and given the sensitivity of the india impairment analysis to changes in the underlying assumptions we performed a step two analysis which indicated a goodwill impairment of 114 million in addition our 2014 annual test of indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in a 45 million pretax writedown of a trademark also associated with the india business also in 2014 in connection with the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 we recorded estimated impairment charges totaling 185 million to writedown goodwill and an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset based on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreedupon sales price 

commodities futures and options contracts 

as discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to manage a number of our market risks specifically we use commodities futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities to manage our commodity price risk which represents a significant market risk exposure for us 

we have historically applied hedge accounting to our commodity derivative instruments in order to qualify for hedge accounting a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period we must formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness we must also maintain certain operational processes and controls that support the conduct of our commodities hedging program additionally since these are typically hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions must be specifically identified and it must be probable that the forecasted transactions will occur if it is no longer probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings 

because we generally have designated these commodity future and option contracts as derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships our marktomarket gains losses were deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” the amounts deferred and reclassified from aoci were as follows 



as discussed in item 9a controls and procedures our cocoa commodity derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2015 therefore changes in the fair value of cocoa commodity derivatives for the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were recorded as incurred within cost of sales in the income statement 

effective january 1 2016 we are no longer electing to designate any of our existing or new cocoa or other commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment additionally we have revised our definition of segment income and redefined nongaap income and earnings per share measures to exclude gains and losses on commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold this change to our definition of segment income and nongaap income and nongaap earnings per share will continue to reflect the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the marktomarket volatility within our reported segment income as well as nongaap income and nongaap earnings per share 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final 

outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances our valuation allowances are primarily related to us capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

in order to manage interest rate exposure we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements we are currently using forward starting interest rate swap agreements to reduce interest volatility associated with certain anticipated debt issues and fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of these swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2015  and 2014 was 850 million and 12 billion respectively the notional amount at december 31 2015 includes 350 million of fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this now variable rate debt as of december 31 2015 would have increased interest expense by approximately 36 million for the full year 2015 and 46 million for the full year 2014 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 by approximately 76 million and 57 million respectively however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2015 and 2014 the net fair value of these instruments was a liability of 01 million and an asset of 15 million respectively assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 32 million and 70 million respectively 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time 

we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2015 average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2014 and traded in a range between 128 and 153 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract cocoa production was higher in 2015 and global demand was slightly higher which produced a small surplus in cocoa supplies over the past year despite the small increase in global cocoa inventories prices remained elevated in response to concerns over the future balance of global cocoa supply and demand 

the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

during 2015 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 015 per pound to a high of 018 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis dairy prices were lower than 2014 driven by increased production and larger inventories globally 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the united states are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2015 as part of an antidumping case against mexican sugar producers the us government determined that mexico was dumping sugar into the us market as a result of the case the us and mexican governments signed a suspension agreement which will limit sugar exports from mexico to the us and cause us sugar prices to trade 003 to 005 per pound higher than prior to the case us refined sugar prices traded in a range from 036 to 040 per pound during 2015 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 052 per pound and closed the year at 046 per pound peanut supply is ample to support us demand heading into 2016 almond prices began the year at 434 per pound and decreased to 404 per pound during 2015 the fourth consecutive year of drought in california had a negative impact on yields with the 2015 crop estimated to be approximately 5 lower than 2014 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity sensitivity analysis 

our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 3748 million as of december 31 2015 and 3475 million as of december 31 2014 at the end of 2015 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2015 by 375 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases

controls and procedures   

tableend we have established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2015 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2015 solely due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to hedge accounting compliance for cocoa commodity derivatives as described in the management report on internal control over financial reporting that follows 

 the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and 15d15f the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission’s 2013 framework because of the deficiency described below management concluded that as of december 31 2015 there was a material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting and therefore the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 

management has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting that existed as of december 31 2015 solely related to its accounting for cocoa derivative financial instruments pursuant to the provisions of fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  asc 815 this material weakness arose in the quarter ended october 4 2015 and was the result of changes the company made in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to its hedging program and related controls specifically the control designed to monitor compliance with the company’s hedge documentation did not operate as designed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 as a result instances of noncompliance with our hedging program related to cocoa derivatives occurred and were not detected timely and therefore we did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment under asc 815 

this material weakness resulted in an immaterial error in cost of goods sold and accumulated other comprehensive income in the company’s financial statements as of and for the quarter ended october 4 2015 for details of the quarterly impact please refer to note 16 quarterly data  in light of this material weakness prior to filing this annual report on form 10k we completed additional procedures and analysis designed to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting based on such procedures and analysis we concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with us gaap 

the companys independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has audited the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 which report is included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 the company previously announced its intention effective january 1 2016 to no longer designate its existing or future purchases of commodity derivatives including cocoa derivatives as cash flow hedges and will not elect to qualify for hedge accounting treatment as a result the controls associated with monitoring compliance with asc 815 to qualify for hedge accounting are no longer relevant for our commodity hedges therefore there is no need for remediation of the material weakness 

 except for the matters noted in c above there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and sugar confectionery we market sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide 

reportable segments 

we operate under a matrix reporting structure designed to ensure continued focus on north america coupled with an emphasis on accelerating growth in our international markets as we continue to transform into a more global company our business is organized around geographic regions and strategic business units it is designed to enable us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets the presidents of our geographic regions along with the senior vice president responsible for our global retail and licensing business are accountable for delivering our annual financial plans and report into our ceo who serves as our chief operating decision maker “codm” so we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis because our north america business currently generates over 85 of our consolidated revenue and none of our other geographic regions are individually significant we have historically presented our business as one reportable segment however given the recent growth in our international business combined with the september 2014 acquisition of shanghai golden monkey we have elected to begin reporting our operations within two segments north america and international and other to provide additional transparency into our operations outside of north america we have defined our reportable segments as follows 

 across our business we also focus on growth within our three strategic business units  chocolate sweets and refreshments and snacks and adjacencies these strategic business units focus on specific components of our product line and are responsible for building and leveraging the company’s global brands and disseminating best demonstrated practices around the world all of our products are marketed and distributed through our existing geographic gotomarket platforms 

financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our management’s discussion and analysis and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

business acquisitions 

in september 2014 we completed the acquisition of 80 of the outstanding shares of shanghai golden monkey food joint stock co ltd “sgm” a confectionery company based in shanghai china sgm operates through six production facilities located in china and the golden monkey product line is primarily sold through traditional trade channels 

in 2014 we also acquired all of the outstanding shares of the allan candy company limited “allan” headquartered in ontario canada and a controlling interest in lotte shanghai food company a joint venture established in 2007 in china for the purpose of manufacturing and selling product to the joint venture partners these acquisitions provide us with additional manufacturing and distribution capacity to serve primarily the north america and asia markets respectively 

in january 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of brookside foods ltd “brookside” a privately held confectionery company based in abbottsford british columbia canada as part of this transaction we acquired two production facilities located in british columbia and quebec and expanded our product line to include brookside’s chocolate covered fruitflavored confectionery products 

products 

our principal confectionery offerings include chocolate and sugar confectionery products gum and mint refreshment products pantry items such as baking ingredients toppings and beverages and snack items such as spreads 

 principal customers and marketing strategy 

our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires and department stores the majority of our customers with the exception of wholesale distributors resell our products to endconsumers in retail outlets in north america and other locations worldwide 

in 2014  approximately 25 of our consolidated net sales were made to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

raw materials and pricing 

cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products these cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 72 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii fluid dairy milk peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits when we implement price increases as we did in july 2014 in north america there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales in part because we honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service 

seasonality and backlog 

our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns we manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt therefore the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks the trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the us and other key international markets where our products are sold we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s  and reese’s  brand names 

furthermore we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 



research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries including the united states mexico brazil india and china we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of commerce and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the united states 

we believe our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate the supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety various government agencies and thirdparty firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations 

we made routine operating and capital expenditures during 2014  to comply with environmental laws and regulations these expenditures were not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we employed approximately 20800 fulltime and 1650 parttime employees worldwide our employee headcount has increased compared to prior years due mainly to recent acquisitions most notably sgm collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 5750 employees during 2015  agreements are expected to be negotiated for certain employees at four facilities outside of the united states comprising approximately 64 of total employees under collective bargaining agreements we believe that our employee relations are good 

financial information by geographic area 

our principal operations and markets are located in the united states the percentage of total consolidated net sales for our businesses outside of the united states was 175 for 2014  166 for 2013  and 162 for 2012  the percentage of total consolidated assets outside of the united states was 354 as of december 31 2014  and 194 as of december 31 2013

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if 

we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently or in a timely manner to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

in north america we announced a weighted average price increase in july 2014 of approximately 8 across our instant consumable multipack packaged candy and grocery lines to help offset part of the significant increases in our input costs including raw materials packaging fuel utilities and transportation which we expect to incur in the future while the increase was effective immediately direct buying customers were given an opportunity to purchase transitional amounts of product at price points prior to the increase during the immediately following fourweek period and the increase is not expected to benefit seasonal sales until halloween 2015 accordingly we expect that the majority of the financial benefit from this pricing action will impact earnings in 2015 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures in these markets as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 25 of our total net sales in 2014  mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations in 2014 we also experienced increased levels of instore activity for other snack items which pressured confectionery category growth in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and must continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately twothirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 



we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service 

providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

our expanding international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2014  we derived approximately 18 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states versus 17 in 2013 and 16 in 2012 additionally 35 of our total consolidated assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2014  as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in mexico brazil india and china as a result we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible 

and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

future developments related to civil antitrust lawsuits and the possible investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in the united states could negatively impact our reputation and our operating results   

we are a defendant in a number of civil antitrust lawsuits in the united states including individual class and putative class actions brought against us by purchasers of our products the us department of justice also notified the company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry into certain alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry but has not requested any information or documents additional information about these proceedings is contained in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violators are subject to civil andor criminal fines and other sanctions class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments including in some cases payment of treble damages andor attorneys fees to the successful plaintiff additionally negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our companys brands and reputation possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products these possible consequences in our opinion currently are not expected to materially impact our financial position or liquidity but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which any fines settlements or judgments are accrued or paid respectively

the mda is organized in the following sections 

 overview and outlook 

we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and sugar confectionery we market sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide as of december 31 2014 we began reporting our operations through two segments north america and international and other 

in 2014 we continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives 

 however 2014 also presented some challenges in our us markets we believe lower retail store traffic and changes in consumer spending patterns impacted how consumers shopped for snacks while a number of our international markets continued to experience macroeconomic headwinds despite these challenges our 2014 net sales and net income growth of 39 and 32 respectively reflects solid performance 

for the full year 2014 our us cmg retail takeaway increase of 27 was about one full percentage point greater than the category growth rate however throughout the year retail store traffic and consumer trips were irregular additionally increased levels of distribution and instore activity of items such as salty bakery and meat snacks by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers were prevalent throughout the year and drove broader snacking category growth in 2014 which we believe adversely impacted purchases of nonseasonal candy products 

our 2014 international net sales increased nearly 15 including a 27 unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and net sales contribution of approximately 7 or 54 million from shanghai golden monkey food joint stock co ltd “sgm” excluding sgm and the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact our international net sales increased approximately 10 

our 2014 results were also impacted by increasing commodity and other input costs in north america we announced a weighted average price increase in july 2014 of approximately 8 across our instant consumable multipack packaged candy and grocery lines to help offset part of the significant increases in our input costs including raw 

materials packaging fuel utilities and transportation which we expect to incur in the future while the increase was effective immediately direct buying customers were given an opportunity to purchase transitional amounts of product at price points prior to the increase during the immediately following fourweek period and the increase is not expected to benefit seasonal sales until halloween 2015 therefore this action did not materially benefit our 2014 results but should be beneficial to our 2015 earnings 

entering 2015 we are focused on accelerating growth and we have a solid lineup of new products that will bring variety news and excitement to the category in addition to the fourth quarter carryover benefit from brookside  crunchy clusters and reese’s  spreads take home jar we are also launching kit kat  white minis hershey’s  caramels ice breakers   cool blasts  chews reese’s  spreads snacksters  graham dippers and some other yettobeannounced new candy and snacking products these launches will be supported with higher levels of advertising and instore merchandising and programming that should enable us to mitigate the impact of volume elasticity related to the 2014 price increase and compete effectively across the cmg and broader snack categories additionally we expect advertising including a greater shift to digital and mobile communication to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth 

we currently estimate full year 2015 net sales growth of 55 to 75 including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 25 this reflects our expectation for continued macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and slowly improving us nonseasonal trends in addition we now anticipate foreign currency exchange impacts to be greater than our previous estimate and to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 on full year net sales growth 

we continue to focus on growth initiatives and marginenhancing opportunities in addition to normal productivity gains with the conclusion of the project next century “pnc” program in 2015 we will begin to focus on the opportunities that exist for future incremental increases in productivity and costs savings a portion of any potential savings from this assessment would be reinvested in initiatives to accelerate revenue growth we continue to have good visibility into our cost structure with the exception of dairy products which cannot be effectively hedged we currently expect 2015 gross margin to increase approximately 135 to 145 basis points driven by the 2014 pricing action and productivity therefore we expect 2015 growth in earnings per sharediluted in a range of 10 to 13 including net dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of 003 to 005 per share we expect growth in adjusted earnings per sharediluted of 8 to 10 as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2015 provided below 

nongaap information 

the following table provides a reconciliation of projected 2015 earnings per sharediluted and 2014 and 2013 earnings per sharediluted each prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” to nongaap projected adjusted earnings per sharediluted for 2015 and adjusted earnings per sharediluted for 2014 and 2013 



for the nongaap adjusted earnings per sharediluted measure presented above we have provided 1 the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure 3 an explanation of why our management believes this nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and 4 additional purposes for which we use this nongaap measure 

we believe that the disclosure of adjusted earnings per sharediluted provides investors with a better comparison of our yeartoyear operating results we exclude the effects of certain items from earnings per sharediluted when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 

adjusted earnings per sharediluted excludes the impacts of acquisition integration and transaction costs charges and noncash impairments associated with our business realignment initiatives the noncash goodwill impairment charge relating to our india business the estimated loss on the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business and nonservicerelated pension expense income 

nonservicerelated pension expense income includes interest costs the expected return on pension plan assets the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits the nonservicerelated pension expense income may be quite volatile from yeartoyear as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets therefore we have excluded nonservicerelated pension expense income from our internal performance measures and we believe that adjusted earnings per sharediluted excluding nonservicerelated pension expense income will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our ongoing business we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from yeartoyear our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants in 2007 resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable 

consolidated results of operations 



net sales 

2014  compared with 2013   

net sales increased 39 in 2014 compared with 2013 reflecting volume growth of 44 and favorable net price realization of 02 offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 07 the volume growth was driven by incremental sales of new products in our north america and international and other segments coupled with almost 1 of growth from the recent sgm acquisition the pricing benefit from the midyear price increase was largely offset by higher trade promotions and lower core volumes associated with nearterm volume elasticity related to the price increase as discussed previously we expect the 2014 pricing action to be more impactful to our 2015 results 

2013  compared with 2012   

net sales increased 76 in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting volume increases of 78 and nominal price realization of 01 offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 03 higher sales of brookside  products contributed approximately 13 to the net sales increase 

key us marketplace metrics 



consumer takeaway and the change in market share are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution primarily include food drug mass merchandisers and convenience store channels plus walmart stores inc partial dollar club and military channels hersheys  spreads the jar and instant consumable pack types is not captured in the us cmg database referenced herein as nielsen captures this within grocery items 

these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category in 2014 the category and hershey growth rates were below historical levels as retail store traffic and consumer trips were irregular during the year additionally increased levels of distribution and instore activity of items such as salty bakery and meat snacks by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers were prevalent throughout the year and drove broader snacking category growth in 2014 despite these market dynamics for the full year 2014 our us cmg retail takeaway increased 27 which exceeded the category growth rate of 18 and our market share increased by 30 basis points 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2014  compared with 2013   

cost of sales increased 57 in 2014 compared with 2013 higher costs associated with sales volume increases higher commodity and other incremental supply chain costs and unfavorable sales mix increased total cost of sales by approximately 78 the higher commodity costs were largely driven by higher dairy ingredient costs which cannot be effectively hedged while the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a greater proportion of seasonal sales volumes which are typically at lower margins than nonseasonal products these cost increases were offset in part by supply chain productivity improvements and lower pension costs which together reduced cost of sales by approximately 21 

gross margin decreased by 90 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013 supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives favorable net price realization and operating leverage from the higher sales volumes collectively improved gross margin by 150 basis points the impact of lower pension expenses in 2014 in comparison with 2013 benefited 2014 gross margin by 20 basis points however these benefits were more than offset by higher commodity and other input costs and unfavorable sales mix which together reduced gross profit margin by approximately 260 basis points 

2013  compared with 2012   

cost of sales increased 21 in 2013 compared with 2012 the impact of sales volume increases and supply chain cost inflation together increased cost of sales by approximately 94 lower input costs supply chain productivity improvements and a favorable sales mix reduced cost of sales by approximately 63 business realignment and impairment charges of 04 million were included in cost of sales in 2013 compared with 364 million in the prior year benefiting 2013 cost of sales by 10 

gross margin increased by 290 basis points in 2013 compared with 2012 reduced input costs supply chain productivity improvements a favorable sales mix and lower fixed costs as a percent of sales together improved gross margin by 390 basis points these improvements were partially offset by supply chain cost inflation which reduced gross margin by 160 basis points the impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2013 compared with 2012 benefited 2013 gross margin by 60 basis points 

selling marketing and administrative 

2014  compared with 2013   

selling marketing and administrative “sma” expenses decreased 215 million or 11 in 2014 this includes a 31 reduction in advertising and related consumer marketing expenses due to the timing of new product launches a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas excluding advertising and related consumer marketing expenses selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat compared to 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs and discretionary cost containment efforts offset in part by higher employeerelated costs including additional headcount in our china business and additional focused selling resources as well as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of sgm selling and administrative expenses in 2014 also benefited from the 46 million gain recorded in the first quarter on the lotte shanghai food company “lsfc” acquisition and the 56 million in foreign currency gains realized on forward contracts related to the manufacturing facility under construction in johor malaysia 

2013  compared with 2012   

sma expenses increased 2187 million or 128 in 2013 contributing to the overall increase was a 197 increase in advertising consumer promotions and other marketing expenses to support core brands and the introduction of new products in the us and international markets excluding the advertising and related consumer marketing costs selling and administrative expenses increased 88 primarily as a result of higher employeerelated expenses increased incentive compensation costs legal fees and increased marketing research expenses along with the writeoff of certain assets associated with the remodeling of increased office space there were minimal business realignment charges included in sma in 2013 compared with 25 million in 2012

business realignment and impairment charges recorded during 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



next century program 

in june 2010 we announced project next century the “next century program” as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure as part of the program production was transitioned from the companys centuryold facility at 19 east chocolate avenue in hershey pennsylvania to an expanded west hershey facility which was built in 1992 the next century program is essentially complete as of december 31 2014 projecttodate costs totaled 1979 million through december 31 2014 in line with our estimates of total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs of 190 million to 200 million 

in 2014 and 2013 plant closure expenses were primarily related to costs associated with the demolition of the former manufacturing facility 

in 2012 charges relating to the next century program included the following 364 million recorded in cost of sales related primarily to startup costs and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over the reduced estimated remaining useful lives 24 million recorded in selling marketing and administrative expense for project administration business realignment charges of 158 million relating to a noncash pension settlement loss resulting from lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company primarily in connection with the next century program and 208 million primarily related to costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility and the relocation of production lines 

planned divestiture of mauna loa 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell the mauna loa macadamia nut corporation in connection with the anticipated sale we have recorded an estimated loss of 223 million to reflect the disposal entity at fair value less an estimate of the selling costs see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

india impairment 

in connection with our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing in december 2014 we recorded noncash goodwill and trademark impairment charges totaling 159 million associated with our business in india see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other international restructuring programs 

during 2014 we implemented restructuring programs at several nonus entities to rationalize select manufacturing and distribution activities resulting in severance and accelerated depreciation costs of 45 million these costs are recorded within cost of sales and selling marketing and administrative costs we expect to incur approximately 37 million of additional accelerated depreciation in 2015 other remaining costs relating to these programs are not expected to be significant 

trius inc impairment charges 

in december 2012 the board of directors of trius inc a company that manufactured marketed and sold nutritional beverages in which we held a controlling ownership interest decided to cease operations as a result of operational difficulties quality issues and competitive constraints it was determined that investments necessary to continue the business would not generate sufficient return accordingly in december 2012 the company recorded noncash impairment charges of approximately 75 million primarily associated with the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets these charges excluded the portion of the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests 

income before interest and income taxes ebit and ebit margin 

2014  compared with 2013   

ebit increased 37 in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the higher level of gross profit and lower overall selling marketing and administrative costs offset in part by the higher business realignment and impairment charges in 2014 as discussed above 

ebit margin was 187 in 2014 and 2013 respectively while gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2014 this was offset by a lower level of sma expense as a percent of sales which was favorable by 130 basis points in 2014 

2013  compared with 2012   

ebit increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as a result of higher gross profit and lower business realignment charges partially offset by higher selling marketing and administrative expenses pretax net business realignment and impairment charges of 191 million were recorded in 2013 compared with 838 million recorded in 2012 

ebit margin increased from 167 in 2012 to 187 in 2013 as a result of higher gross margin and lower business realignment charges partially offset by higher sma expenses as a percent of sales the net impact of business realignment impairment and acquisition charges recorded in 2013 reduced ebit margin by 30 basis points while business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2012 reduced ebit margin by 130 basis point 

interest expense net 

2014  compared with 2013   

net interest expense was 48 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 due primarily to a greater level of capitalized interest in 2014 as well as higher interest income earned on shortterm investments 

2013  compared with 2012   

net interest expense in 2013 was 72 million lower than in 2012 primarily as a result of lower shortterm borrowings partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest and higher interest expense on longterm debt 

income taxes and effective tax rate 

2014  compared with 2013   

our effective income tax rate was 352 for 2014 compared with 344 for 2013 the 2014 effective income tax rate was higher due to unfavorable tax return trueup adjustments unfavorable shifts of taxable income to higher tax jurisdictions and the impact of business realignment and impairment charges with minimal tax benefit partly offset by favorable settlement of canadian assessments and favorable settlement of us audits 

2013  compared with 2012   

our effective income tax rate was 344 for 2013 compared with 349 for 2012 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2013 reflected lower state income taxes which were higher in 2012 as a result of the impact of certain state tax legislation and an increase in deductions associated with certain foreign tax jurisdictions partly offset by a higher benefit in 2012 resulting from the completion of tax audits 

net income and net income per share 

2014  compared with 2013   

net income increased 264 million or 32 while earnings per sharediluted “eps” increased 016 or 44 in 2014 compared with 2013 the increases in both net income and eps were driven by higher sales offset by higher commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix as noted above our 2014 eps also benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our boardapproved repurchase programs 

2013  compared with 2012   

net income increased 1596 million or 241 while epsdiluted increased 072 or 249 in 2013 compared with 2012 the increases in both net income and eps were driven by higher sales lower input costs favorable sales mix and lower business realignment and impairment charges 

segment results 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments north america and international and other the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis for segment reporting purposes we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses as well as business realignment and impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs the nonservice related portion of pension expense and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance these items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for internal management reporting and performance evaluation segment income and segment income margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors as they exclude the activities that are not integral to our ongoing operations for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the beginning of this item 7 

our segment results including a reconciliation to our consolidated results were as follows 



 25 

north america 

the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and sugar confectionery market position in the united states and canada this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate sugar confectionery refreshment snack pantry and food service product lines north america accounted for 856 868 and 875 of our net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively north america results for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows 

2014  compared with 2013   

net sales of our north america segment increased 1526 million or 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting volume growth of 24 net price realization of 05 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 04 2014 new product introductions including york and kit kat  minis nutrageous relaunch brookside  crunchy clusters lancaster  soft cremes and hersheys  spreads drove the volume growth as sales volumes for core everyday products were unfavorably impacted by increased levels of distribution and instore activity from confection and other snacking categories higher levels of trade promotion reduced the benefit from the midyear pricing action our canada operations were impacted by the stronger us dollar which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact 

our north america segment income increased 536 million or 29 in 2014 compared to 2013 principally due to higher sales volumes and supply chain productivity improvements which offset input cost increases and unfavorable sales mix our core product mix in 2014 was more heavily weighted toward seasonal offerings which typically generate lower margins than our core everyday instant consumable products additionally advertising consumer promotions and marketing expenses decreased 28 in 2014 due to the timing of new product launches a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas 

2013  compared with 2012   

net sales of our north america segment increased 3874 million or 67 in 2013 compared to 2012 reflecting volume growth of 64 positive net price realization of 05 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 02 higher sales of brookside  products contributed 14 to the 2013 net sales increase for the segment 

our north america segment income increased 2065 million or 125 in 2013 compared to 2012 principally due to higher sales volumes positive sales mix and lower commodity input costs however advertising consumer promotions and marketing expenses increased 150 to support core brands and the introduction of new products which offset some of the increase additionally segment expenses were higher as a result of increased employeerelated incentive compensation and marketing research expenses 

international and other 

the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture import market sell or distribute chocolate sugar confectionery and other products currently this includes our operations in asia latin america europe africa and the middle east along with exports to these regions while a minor component this segment also includes our global retail operations including hershey’s chocolate world stores in hershey pennsylvania new york city chicago las vegas shanghai niagara falls ontario dubai and singapore as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world international and other accounted for 144 132 and 125 of our net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively international and other results for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows 



2014  compared with 2013   

net sales of our international and other segment increased 1231 million or 130 in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting volume growth of 170 unfavorable net price realization of 17 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 23 the sales volume increase was primarily due to increased demand for new and existing products in china as well as 54 million of incremental sales from the newly acquired sgm business excluding sgm our 2014 chocolate net sales grew 35 in china and we increased our market share to almost 10 of the chocolate category our 2014 sales in mexico were unfavorably impacted by the challenging economic environment while our brazil performance improved sequentially as the year progressed finishing 2014 up approximately 7 from the prior year excluding the impact of unfavorable currency the unfavorable price realization reflects increased trade promotions and allowances particularly in china and mexico where we have made additional investments to drive sales volume growth 

our international and other segment income decreased 46 million or 103 in 2014 compared to 2013 as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher trade promotions and a 59 higher investment in advertising to support core brands and the introduction of new products in our international markets the most significant portion of this investment was focused on our china and mexico markets we also increased headcount particularly in china in support of sales growth 

2013  compared with 2012   

net sales of our international and other segment increased 1144 million or 138 in 2013 compared to 2012 reflecting volume growth of 170 unfavorable net price realization of 24 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 09 the sales volume increase was primarily due to sales growth in china mexico and brazil while the unfavorable price realization reflects increased trade promotions and allowances particularly in china and mexico where we have made additional investments to drive sales volume growth 

our international and other segment income decreased 68 million or 132 in 2013 compared to 2012 as the benefit from higher sales volume and improved gross margins was more than offset by a 448 higher investment in advertising consumer promotions and marketing expenses to support core brands and the introduction of new products in our international markets the most significant portion of this investment was focused on our china and mexico markets 

unallocated corporate items 

unallocated corporate administration includes centrallymanaged a corporate functional costs relating to legal treasury finance and human resources b expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations including warehousing distribution and manufacturing information systems and global shared services c noncash stockbased compensation expense and d other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance 

in 2014 unallocated corporate items totaled 5034 million compared to 5335 million in 2013 with the reduction driven by lower incentive compensation expense as well as discretionary cost containment measures intended to mitigate the higher commodity and other input costs in 2014 

in 2013 unallocated corporate items totaled 5335 million compared to 4786 million in 2012 with the increase primarily a result of higher salaries benefits and incentive compensation higher spending on outside services and consulting and higher legal fees and accruals 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased 3502 million relative to 2013 this decline was driven by the following factors 

 partially offsetting these declines were higher net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes impairments and loss on disposal of business resulting from higher sales volumes during the year 

cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased 936 million as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased net earnings in 2013 partly offset by a 27 million incrementally higher investment in working capital to support the higher sales volumes derivative activities had a similar impact on 2013 and 2012 operating cash flow 

pension and postretirement activity we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 382 million 558 million and 

835 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses as well as a 20 million settlement loss in 2012 relating largely to the next century program 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled 531 million 572 million and 442 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 

respectively 

investing activities 

our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property plant and equipment and capitalized software purchases of shortterm investments and acquisitions of businesses partially offset by proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment we used cash of 8626 million for investing activities in 2014 compared to 3516 million in 2013 with the increase driven by 2014 business acquisitions and the purchase of short term investments we used cash of 4734 million for investing activities in 2012 which exceeded the use in 2013 due mainly to the 2012 brookside acquisition 

primary investing activities include the following 

 financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options we used cash of 7193 million for financing activities in 2014 compared to 4466 million in 2013 with the increase due mainly to higher dividend payments and share repurchases offset in part by higher short term borrowings we used cash of 5869 million for financing activities in 2012 which exceeded the use in 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases offset in part by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and lower dividend payments 

the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following 

 29 

remained available under the 250 million share repurchase authorization approved by the board in february 2014 

 liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2014 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3749 million and we held shortterm investments in the form of term deposits with original maturities of oneyear totaling 971 million in total our cash and shortterm investments declined 6465 million compared to the 2013 yearend balance of 11 billion as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion 

approximately half of the balance of our cash cash equivalents and short term investments at december 31 2014 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states if these amounts held outside of the united states were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity our total debt was 22 billion at december 31 2014 and 20 billion at december 31 2013 our total debt increased in 2014 mainly due to the increase in commercial paper outstanding additional debt assumed in the sgm acquisition and additional shortterm borrowings used to fund growth in our existing china operations 

in october 2011 we entered into a fiveyear agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to 11 billion with an option to increase borrowings by an additional 400 million with the consent of the lenders in november 2013 this agreement was amended to reduce the amount of borrowings available under the unsecured revolving credit facility to 10 billion maintain the option to increase borrowings by an additional 400 million with the consent of the lenders and extend the termination date to november 2018 in november 2014 the termination date of this agreement was extended an additional year to november 2019 as of december 31 2014 10 billion was available to borrow under the agreement and no borrowings were outstanding the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants customary representations warranties and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2014 we may use these funds for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks as of december 31 2014 we had available capacity of 1179 million under these lines of credit 

furthermore we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate 

requirements including reducing existing borrowings financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

equity structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding – common stock and class b common stock “class b stock” holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition hershey trust company currently has three representatives who are members of the companys board one of whom is the chairman of the board these representatives from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school in its role as controlling stockholder of the company has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and that the company board and not the hershey trust company board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements   

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2014 



1 includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps interest associated with variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward curve as of december 31 2014 

2 includes the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouses and distribution facilities and certain equipment we do not have material capital lease obligations 

3 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans for more information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

4 purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2014 the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at yearend 2014 nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 

5 represents liability to purchase the remaining 20 of the outstanding shares of sgm see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

plant construction obligations 

in december 2013 we entered into an agreement for the construction of a new confectionery manufacturing plant in malaysia the total cost of construction is expected to be approximately 265 to 275 million the plant is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2015 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded primarily in 2012 and included in business realignment and impairment charges the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material with regard to other facilities we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not 

available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities 

we promote our products with advertising trade promotions and consumer incentives these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past 

our trade promotional costs totaled 11255 million 9957 million and 9493 million in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant over the threeyear period ended december 31 2014  actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than approximately 3 

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most us employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary other postemployment benefit “opeb” plans consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations 

the net periodic benefit costs relating to our pension and opeb plans were as follows 



1 we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after 2007 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2015  is 323 million the 2014  recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 234 million projections beyond 2014  are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

the weightedaverage assumptions for our pension and opeb plans were as follows 



to determine the expected return on our pension plan assets we consider the current asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical average return over the 27 years prior to december 31 2014 was approximately 87 the actual return on assets was 84 167 and 132 for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class the current estimated asset return is based upon the following targeted asset allocation for our domestic pension plans 



our expected return on plan assets has been reduced to reflect the lower proportion of plan assets allocated to equity securities 

sensitivity of assumptions 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses the discount rate used for our pension and opeb plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans a 100 basis point decline in the weighted average pension discount rate would increase net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 45 million a decrease in the opeb discount rate by 100 basis points would decrease annual opeb expense by approximately 13 million for the opeb plans a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the postretirement benefit obligation 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since certain of our defined benefit pension plans are partially funded for 2015 we reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 63 from the 70 assumption used in 2014 to reflect the revised target equity allocation of 50 the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the rate of return for pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately 106 million 

for yearend 2014 we adopted the society of actuaries updated rp2014 mortality tables with mp2014 generational projection scales however adoption of these tables did not have a significant impact on our pension obligations or net period benefit cost since our primary plans are cash balance plans and most participants take lumpsum settlements upon retirement 

funding

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter our 2014 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the sgm acquisition that was completed on september 26 2014 just prior to our annual testing date 

we use a twostep process to quantitatively evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value with the book values of each asset 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets using an income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates estimated 

discount rates which may be riskadjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

at december 31 2014  the book value of our goodwill totaled 793 million and related to six reporting units including sgm which was excluded from 2014 testing as noted above the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value was at least 50 for each of our tested reporting units with the exception of our india reporting unit whose estimated fair value approximated its carrying value as a result and given the sensitivity of the india impairment analysis to changes in the underlying assumptions we performed a step two analysis which indicated a goodwill impairment of 114 million our 2014 annual test of indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in a 45 million pretax writedown of a trademark also associated with the india business these impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter 

we also have intangible assets consisting primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions that are expected to have determinable useful lives the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finitelived assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

no additional impairments were indicated by the results of our annual testing in 2014 or 2013 however in connection with the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 we recorded estimated impairment charges totaling 185 million to writedown goodwill and an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset based on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreedupon sales price 

commodities futures and options contracts 

as discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to manage a number of our market risks specifically we use commodities futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities to manage our commodity price risk which represents a significant market risk exposure for us because commodity costs comprise a significant portion of our cost of sales we typically apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative instruments to enable us to reduce the effect of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs 

in order to qualify for hedge accounting a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period we must formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness we must also maintain certain operational processes and controls that support the conduct of our commodities hedging program additionally since these are typically hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions must be specifically identified and it must be probable that the forecasted transactions will occur if it is no longer probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings 

because we generally designate these commodity future and option contracts as derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships our marktomarket gains losses deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and reclassified from aoci were as follows 



income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances valuation allowances are recorded for deferred income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized valuation allowances are primarily associated with temporary differences related to advertising and promotions as well as tax loss carryforwards from operations in various foreign tax jurisdictions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

refer to note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies 

interest rate risk 

in order to manage interest rate exposure we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements we are currently using forward starting interest rate swap agreements to reduce interest volatility associated with certain anticipated debt issues and fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of these swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31 2014  and 2013 was 12 billion and 250 million respectively the notional amount at december 31 2014 includes 450 million of fixedtofloating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixedrate debt to variable rate debt a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this now variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 would have increased interest expense by approximately 46 million for the full year 2014 we had minimal variable rate interest exposure as of december 31 2013 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio excluding fixedrate debt converted to variable with fixedtofloating instruments to be minimal since this debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2014 yearend fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 83 million however since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the us dollar we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

a summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



in 2013 foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purchase of malaysian ringgits and certain other currencies were associated with the construction of the manufacturing facility in malaysia 

the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences at december 31 2014 and 2013 the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of 15 million and 32 million respectively assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these instruments would have declined by 70 million and 129 million respectively our risk related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2014 average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2013 and traded in a range between 125 and 145 per pound based on the intercontinental exchange futures contract cocoa production was higher in 2014 and global demand was slightly higher which produced a small surplus in cocoa supplies over the past year despite the small increase in global cocoa inventories prices remained elevated in response to concerns over the future balance of global cocoa supply and demand 

the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinental exchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

during 2014 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 022 per pound to a high of 026 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis dairy prices reached historically high levels during 2014 driven by increased imports by china and supply challenges due to the 2013 drought in new zealand 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the united states are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2014 us sugar producers filed an antidumping suit against mexico which reduced sugar imports from mexico as a result refined sugar prices increased compared to 2013 trading higher in a range from 031 to 042 per pound 

peanut prices in the united states began the year around 049 per pound and closed the year at 053 per pound peanut supply is ample to support us demand heading into 2015 almond prices began the year at 369 per pound and increased to 439 per pound during 2014 the third consecutive year of droughts in california had a negative impact on yields with the 2014 crop estimated to be 10 lower than 2013 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinental exchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity position sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10 based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities our “requirements” inventories fixedprice forward contracts and anticipated purchases not yet under contract are not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period the market risk noted below reflects the potential loss in future earnings resulting from the hypothetical adverse market price movement 



the negative positions primarily resulted as our requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years

marketing strategy and seasonality 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we use our promotional programs to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time seeking to maintain consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

usually there is a time lag between the effective date of list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales the impact of price increases is often delayed because we honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales   

in march 2011 we announced a weightedaverage increase in wholesale prices of approximately 97 across the majority of our us puerto rico and export portfolio effective immediately the price increase applied to our instant consumable multipack packaged candy and grocery lines direct buying customers were able to purchase transitional amounts of product into may 2011 and seasonal net price realization did not occur until easter 2012 

raw materials 

cocoa products are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are used to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers these thirdparty suppliers source cocoa beans which are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions to produce the cocoa products we purchase west africa accounts for approximately 72 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

we also use substantial quantities of sugar class ii fluid dairy milk peanuts almonds and energy in our production process most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states for our international operations inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries 

we enter into futures contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to manage price risks for cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commoditiesprice risk management and futures contracts on page 39 

product sourcing 

we manufacture or contract to our specifications for the manufacture of the products we sell we enter into manufacturing contracts with third parties to improve our strategic competitive position and achieve cost effective production and sourcing of our products 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america and certain markets in latin america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are much larger companies that have greater resources and more substantial international operations competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences as well as convenience and service

risk factors 

tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements or could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations are the risk factors described below 

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures in these markets as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 255 of our total net sales in 2013 mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are much larger companies that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

approximately threequarters of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from among other factors the following 



we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage such events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or find that it is not financially feasible to effectively plan for or mitigate potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations 

in 2013 we derived approximately 166 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally 194 of our total consolidated assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2013 as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in mexico brazil india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is critically important to our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction 

errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

future developments related to civil antitrust lawsuits and the possible investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in the united states could negatively impact our reputation and our operating results   

we are a defendant in a number of civil antitrust lawsuits in the united states including individual class and putative class actions brought against us by purchasers of our products the us department of justice also notified the company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry into certain alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry but has not requested any information or documents additional information about these proceedings is contained in item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k 

competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violators are subject to civil andor criminal fines and other sanctions class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments including in some cases payment of treble damages andor attorneys fees to the successful plaintiff additionally negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our companys brands and reputation possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products these possible consequences in our opinion currently are not expected to materially impact our financial position or liquidity but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which any fines settlements or judgments are accrued or paid respectively

legal proceedings   

tableend in 2007 the competition bureau of canada began an inquiry into alleged violations of the canadian competition act  in the sale and supply of chocolate products sold in canada between 2002 and 2008 by members of the confectionery industry including hershey canada inc the us department of justice also notified the company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry but has not requested any information or documents 

subsequently 13 civil lawsuits were filed in canada and 91 civil lawsuits were filed in the united states against the company the lawsuits were instituted on behalf of direct purchasers of our products as well as indirect purchasers that purchase our products for use or for resale several other chocolate and confectionery companies were named as defendants in these lawsuits as they also were the subject of investigations andor inquiries by the government entities referenced above the cases seek recovery for losses suffered as a result of alleged conspiracies in restraint of trade in connection with the pricing practices of the defendants the canadian civil cases were settled in 2012 hershey canada inc reached a settlement agreement with the competition bureau of canada through their leniency program with regard to an inquiry into alleged violations of the canadian competition act  in the sale and supply of chocolate products sold in canada by members of the confectionery industry on june 21 2013 hershey canada inc pleaded guilty to one count of price fixing related to communications with competitors in canada in 2007 and paid a fine of approximately 40 million hershey canada inc had promptly reported the conduct to the competition bureau cooperated fully with its investigation and did not implement the planned price increase that was the subject of the 2007 communications 

with regard to the us lawsuits the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation assigned the cases to the us district court for the middle district of pennsylvania plaintiffs are seeking actual and treble damages against the company and other defendants based on an alleged overcharge for certain or in some cases all chocolate products sold in the us between december 2002 and december 2007 and certain plaintiff groups have alleged damages that extend beyond the alleged conspiracy period the lawsuits have been proceeding on different scheduling tracks for different groups of plaintiffs 

defendants have briefed summary judgment against the direct purchaser plaintiffs that have not sought class certification the “optout plaintiffs” and those that have the “direct purchaser class plaintiffs” the direct purchaser class plaintiffs were granted class certification in december 2012 liability fact and expert discovery in the optout plaintiffs’ and direct purchaser class plaintiffs’ cases has been completed the hearing on summary judgment for the direct purchaser class plaintiffs combined with the summary judgment hearing for the optout plaintiffs was held on october 7 2013 a decision is expected in the near term putative class plaintiffs that purchased product indirectly for resale the “indirect purchasers for resale” have moved for class certification a briefing schedule has not been finalized putative class plaintiffs that purchased product indirectly for use the “indirect end users” may seek class certification after summary judgment against the direct purchaser class plaintiffs and the optout plaintiffs has been resolved no trial date has been set for any group of plaintiffs the company will continue to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 

competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violations are subject to civil andor criminal fines and other sanctions class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments including in some cases payment of treble damages andor attorneys fees to the successful plaintiff additionally negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our companys brands and reputation possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products these possible consequences in our opinion are currently not expected to materially impact our financial position or liquidity but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which any fines settlements or judgments are accrued or paid respectively

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend executive overview 

results for the year ended december 31 2013 were strong with increases in net sales earnings per share and profitability despite continued macroeconomic challenges net sales increased 76 compared with 2012 due to sales volume increases in the united states and key international markets as we continued our focus on core brands and innovation advertising expense increased 213 for the year supporting core brands along with new product launches net income and earnings per sharediluted also increased at greater rates than our longterm growth targets the investments we have made in both productivity and cost savings resulted in a business model that is more efficient and effective enabling us to deliver predictable consistent and achievable marketplace and financial performance we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid 

adjusted nongaap financial measures 

our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below 1 the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure 3 an explanation of why our management believes these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors and 4 additional purposes for which we use these nongaap measures 

we believe that the disclosure of these nongaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our yeartoyear operating results we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes “ebit” ebit margin net income and income per sharedilutedcommon stock “eps” when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 

adjusted nongaap financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits recorded during the last four years associated with our business realignment initiatives and impairment charges nonservicerelated pension expenses also are excluded for each of the last four years along with acquisition closing integration and transaction costs and a gain on the sale of certain noncore trademark licensing rights in 2011 

nonservicerelated pension expenses include interest costs the expected return on pension plan assets the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits nonservicerelated pension expenses may be very volatile from yeartoyear as a result of changes in interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets therefore we have excluded nonservicerelated pension expense from our results in accordance with gaap we believe that nongaap financial results excluding nonservicerelated pension expenses will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our ongoing business we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from yeartoyear our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants after 2007 resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable 







summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our gaap income statement 



net sales 

2013 compared with 2012

our effective income tax rate was 344 for 2013 compared with 349 for 2012 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2013 reflected lower state income taxes which were higher in 2012 as a result of the impact of certain state tax legislation and an increase in deductions associated with certain foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by a higher benefit in 2012 resulting from the completion of tax audits 

2012 compared with 2011 

our effective income tax rate was 349 for 2012 compared with 347 for 2011 the effective income tax rate was slightly higher in 2012 primarily reflecting the impact of tax rates associated with business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2012 compared with 2011 and the mix of the companys income among various tax jurisdictions

financial condition 

our financial condition remained strong during 2013 reflecting strong cash flow from operations 

business acquisitions 

acquisitions of businesses are accounted for as purchases and accordingly their results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions the purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

in january 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of brookside foods ltd “brookside” a privately held confectionery company based in abbottsford british columbia canada as part of this transaction we acquired two production facilities located in british columbia and quebec the brookside product line is primarily sold in the us and canada in a takehome resealable pack type 

our financial statements reflect the final accounting for the brookside acquisition the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately 1729 million the purchase price allocation of the brookside acquisition is as follows 



 the excess purchase price over the estimated value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded to goodwill the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 

we included results subsequent to the acquisition date in the consolidated financial statements if we had included the results of the acquisition in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented the effect would not have been material 

assets 

a summary of our assets is as follows 





liabilities 

a summary of our liabilities is as follows 





capital structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board of directors with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in this section we refer to hershey trust company in its capacity as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school as the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” in addition the milton hershey school trust currently has three representatives who are members of the board of directors of the company one of whom is the chairman of the board these representatives from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management the trust has indicated that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and that the company board and not the trust board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 

in may 2007 we entered into an agreement with godrej beverages and foods ltd a consumer goods confectionery and food company to manufacture and distribute confectionery products snacks and beverages across india under the agreement we owned a 51 controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd were included in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets in september 2012 we acquired the remaining 49 interest in godrej hershey ltd for approximately 158 million since the company had a controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd the difference between the amount paid and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest of 103 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital and the noncontrolling interest in godrej hershey ltd was eliminated as of september 30 2012

the decrease in noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries from 116 million as of december 31 2012 to 112 million as of december 31 2013 reflected the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share of losses of these entities and currency translation adjustments partially offset by the impact of the cash contributed by bauducco the share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries was 17 million for the year ended december 31 2013 96 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and 74 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this was reflected in selling marketing and administrative expenses 

liquidity and capital resources

registration statements 



offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2013 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 



in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices 

are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2013 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

lease obligations 

lease obligations include the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices retail stores warehouse and distribution facilities and certain equipment 

in september 2013 we entered into an agreement to lease land for the construction of the new confectionery manufacturing plant in johor malaysia the lease term is 99 years and obligations under the terms of the lease require a payment of approximately 240 million in 2014 which is included in lease obligations in the contractual obligations table

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded primarily in 2012 and included in business realignment and impairment charges the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material with regard to other facilities we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments for more information see income taxes beginning on page 47 under use of estimates and other critical accounting policies the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 34 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments to manage risks these include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 

we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by entering into exchangetraded contracts with collateral posting requirements andor by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2013 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments as cash flow hedges except for out of the money options contracts on certain commodities these included interest rate swap agreements foreign exchange forward contracts and options commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2013 note 1 note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2013 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 



we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2013 

interest rate swaps 

in order to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in april 2012 the company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2013 to repay 250 million of 50 notes maturing in april 2013 the weightedaverage fixed rate on these forward starting swap agreements was 24 in may 2012 the company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2015 to repay 250 million of 485 notes maturing in august 2015 the weightedaverage fixed rate on these forward starting swap agreements is 27 

the forward starting swap agreements entered into in april 2012 matured in march 2013 resulting in a realized loss of approximately 95 million also in march 2013 we entered into forward starting swap agreements to continue to hedge interest rate exposure related to the term financing expected to be executed in 2013 the weightedaverage fixed rate on the forward starting swap agreements was 21 

in may 2013 we terminated the forward starting swap agreements which were entered into in march 2013 to 

hedge the anticipated execution of term financing the swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 2625 notes due may 1 2023 resulting in cash payments of 02 million in may 2013 losses on these swap agreements are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the notes 

the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was an asset of 227 million as of december 31 2013 our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates as of december 31 2013 the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately 80 million 

in march 2009 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 in september 2011 the forward starting interest rate swap agreements which were entered into in march 2009 matured resulting in cash payments by the company of approximately 268 million also in september 2011 we entered into forward starting swap agreements to continue to hedge interest rate exposure related to the term financing these swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 15 notes due november 1 2016 resulting in cash payments by the company of 23 million in november 2011 the losses on these swap agreements are being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the notes 

for more information see note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases associated with the construction of a manufacturing facility equipment raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments or forecasted transactions we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



foreign exchange forward contracts for the purchase of malaysian ringgits and certain other currencies are associated with the construction of the manufacturing facility in malaysia 

the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 



our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds for more information on our major raw material requirements see raw materials on page 5 the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2013 the average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with 2012 and traded in a range between 097 and 126 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract cocoa production was moderately lower in 2013 and global demand was slightly higher which produced a small deficit in cocoa supplies over the past year despite the small reduction in global cocoa inventories the global stocks to use ratio remains above 40 and is considered normal 

the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendars years indicated the prices are the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinentalexchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the food conservation and energy act of 2008 impacted the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products in 2013 because it set price support levels for these commodities 

during 2013 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 018 to a high of 022 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis drought in new zealand in early 2013 created a global shortfall in dairy production 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market ideal weather in the north american sugargrowing regions caused prices to trade lower during 2013 as a result refined sugar prices have decreased compared to 2012 trading lower in a range from 036 to 030 per pound 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 046 per pound and increased during the year to 055 per pound price increases were driven by a reduced crop of 195 million tons down 42 from 2012 which was a record crop year in addition the prices were buoyed by the entrance of the chinese into the us peanut market in the first quarter of 2013 almond prices began the year at 295 per pound and increased to 339 per pound during the year driven by a decrease in almond production of approximately 2 versus 2012 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity position sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10 based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories fixedprice forward contracts and anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 



decreases or increases in fair values from 2012 to 2013 primarily reflected changes in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions we discuss our significant accounting policies in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 

liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs 

we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition

pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary 

postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by erisa federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits we review the discount rate assumptions and revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows   



net periodic pension benefit costs 

we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after 2007 

the decrease in net periodic pension benefit cost from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the lower interest cost in the current year our service cost and prior service cost amortization is expected to be approximately 48 million lower in 2014 interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss is expected to decrease in 2014 by 138 million due primarily to the 2013 actual return on plan assets which exceeded the expected longterm return on plan assets assumption and the higher discount rate for more information see note 14 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2014 is 230 million the 2013 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 404 million projections beyond 2013 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit cost 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2011 to 2013 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the towers watson ratelink 4090 discount curve 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 



average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above we increased our 2013 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 



asset return assumptions 

for 2014 we reduced the expected return on plan assets assumption to 70 from the 775 assumption used during 2013 reflecting lower expected future returns on plan assets resulting from a reduction of the pension asset allocation to equity securities we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 26 years prior to december 31 2013 was approximately 87 the actual return on assets was as follows   



the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 



our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 



as of december 31 2013 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index or the us long governmentcredit index 

for 2013 and 2012 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 323 million in 2013 and 214 million in 2012 including 250 million in 2013 to improve the funded status of our domestic plans in addition to contributions to pay benefits under our nonqualified pension plans in both years these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2013 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans for 2014 minimum funding requirements for our pension plans are approximately 36 million and we expect to make additional contributions of approximately 220 million to improve the funded status of our domestic plans 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows   



the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 



for the postretirement benefit plans a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the postretirement benefit obligation 

other postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows   





goodwill and other intangible assets 

we classify intangible assets into 3 categories 1 intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill 

our intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions we are amortizing trademarks with finite lives over their estimated useful lives of approximately 25 years we are amortizing customerrelated intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of approximately 15 years we are amortizing patents over their remaining legal lives of approximately 5 years we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

our intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we do not amortize existing trademarks whose useful lives were determined to be indefinite we conduct impairment tests for other intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 

we evaluate our trademarks with indefinite lives for impairment by comparing their carrying amount to their estimated fair value the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a “relief from royalty payments” methodology this approach involves a twostep process in the first step we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark in the second step we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we use to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also adjust the assumptions if necessary to estimates that we believe market participants would use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

based on our annual impairment evaluations we determined that no goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth profitability and related cash flows along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit we also considered assumptions that market participants may use by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain 

commodities futures and options contracts 

we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the effect of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows   





the amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives including interest rate swap agreements foreign exchange forward contracts and options commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately 225 million after tax as of december 31 2013 this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets valuation allowances are recorded for deferred income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized valuation allowances are primarily associated with temporary differences related to advertising and promotions and tax loss carryforwards from operations in various foreign tax jurisdictions future changes in judgment and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular 

position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state canada and mexico us canadian and mexican federal audit issues typically involve the timing of deductions and transfer pricing adjustments during the first quarter of 2013 the us internal revenue service “irs” commenced its audit of our us income tax returns for 2009 through 2011 and we expect the audit to conclude in 2014 tax examinations by various state taxing authorities could be conducted for years beginning in 2010 we are no longer subject to canadian federal income tax examinations by the canada revenue agency “cra” for years before 2007 during the third quarter of 2013 the cra notified us that it will be conducting an audit of our canadian income tax returns for 2010 through 2012 and we expect the audit to commence in the first quarter of 2014 during the fourth quarter of 2013 the cra concluded its audit for 2007 through 2009 and issued a letter to us indicating proposed adjustments primarily associated with business realignment charges and transfer pricing as of december 31 2013 we recorded accrued income taxes of approximately 706 million related to the proposed adjustments we provided notice to the us competent authority and the cra provided notice to the canada competent authority of the likely need for their assistance to resolve the proposed adjustments accordingly as of december 31 2013 we recorded a noncurrent receivable of approximately 639 million associated with the anticipated resolution of the proposed adjustments by the competent authority of each country we are no longer subject to mexican federal income tax examinations by the servicio de administracion tributaria “sat” for years before 2008 we work with the irs the cra and the sat to resolve proposed audit adjustments and to minimize the amount of adjustments we do not anticipate that any potential tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

we reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 812 million within the next 12 months due to proposed adjustments and settlements associated with tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations because actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements to reflect actual results changes in expectations or events or circumstances after the date this report refer to risk factors beginning on page 9 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

our results for 2013 were strong with solid financial and marketplace results we have a solid position in the marketplace and we are responding to retail customer needs to drive overall category growth 

we have consumerdriven initiatives planned for 2014 that we believe will continue to drive net sales growth across our businesses we expect net sales growth of 5 to 7 including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates net sales increases are expected to be driven by core brand volume growth and innovation in the us and international markets complemented by instore merchandising programming and advertising net sales gains from innovation include the introduction of hersheys  spreads lancaster  soft crèmes caramels and york  minis in addition to the introduction of a brookside  instant consumable packtype brookside  crunchy clusters hersheys kisses  deluxe in china and the continued rollout of our five global brands in key international markets we expect innovation to contribute meaningfully to our net sales growth in 2014 our international business is on track and we expect net sales outside the us and canada to increase toward the top end of our 15 to 20 target on a percentage basis versus 2013 

we have good visibility into our cost structure except for costs of dairy products which cannot be effectively hedged we expect gross margin to increase in 2014 driven by productivity and cost savings initiatives along with a favorable sales mix we do not expect input cost deflation in 2014 therefore we expect 2014 gross margin on a reported basis to increase about 60 basis points with expansion of adjusted gross margin expected to be around 50 basis points as a result we anticipate that earnings per sharediluted in accordance with gaap will increase 11 to 14 in 2014 compared with 2013 growth in adjusted earnings per sharediluted is expected to be in the 9 to 11 range as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted earnings per sharediluted projections provided below 

advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid to high singledigits on a percentage basis versus last year selling marketing and administrative expenses excluding advertising and related consumer marketing are expected to increase at a more modest rate in 2014 as we build on the investments in gotomarket capabilities established over the last few years as well as consumer knowledgebased projects related to our insights driven performance initiatives 

note  in the outlook above we have provided income measures excluding certain items in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes these nongaap measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

in 2013 the company recorded gaap charges of 190 million or 005 per sharediluted attributable to the next century program nonservice related pension expense of 109 million or 003 per sharediluted was recorded in 2013 in 2013 the company recorded pretax acquisition costs of 41 million or 003 per sharediluted primarily related to the agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of sgm 

in 2014 the company expects to record gaap charges of about 70 million to 90 million or 002 to 003 per sharediluted charges associated with the next century program are expected to be 001 to 002 per sharediluted acquisition closing integration and transaction charges related to sgm are expected to be 002 to 003 per sharediluted nonservice related pension income is expected to be approximately 001 to 002 per sharediluted in 2014 

below is a reconciliation of 2012 and 2013 and projected 2014 earnings per sharediluted in accordance with gaap to nongaap 2012 and 2013 adjusted earnings per sharediluted and projected adjusted earnings per sharediluted for 2014

marketing strategy and seasonality 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we use our promotional programs to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

usually there is a time lag between the effective date of list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales the impact of price increases is often delayed because we honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales   

in march 2011 we announced a weightedaverage increase in wholesale prices of approximately 97 across the majority of our us puerto rico and export portfolio effective immediately the price increase applied to our instant consumable multipack packaged candy and grocery lines direct buying customers were able to purchase transitional amounts of product into may and seasonal net price realization did not occur until easter 2012 

raw materials 

cocoa products are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are used to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa products are purchased directly from thirdparty suppliers these thirdparty suppliers source cocoa beans which are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions to produce the cocoa products which we purchase west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

historically there have been instances of adverse weather crop disease political unrest and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that such a disruption would occur in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

during 2012 the average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with 2011 and traded in a range between 117 and 100 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract after trading at 37year highs in early 2011 cocoa prices moderated in 2012 the table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinentalexchange 



source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the food conservation and energy act of 2008 impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

during 2012 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 014 to a high of 019 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis higher feed prices resulting from the historic drought in the us caused dairy prices to rise starting in july but not to the price levels experienced during 2011 our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in early 2012 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions however ideal weather in the north american sugargrowing regions caused prices to trade lower in the fall of 2012 as a result refined sugar prices decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 trading lower in a range from 054 to 037 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 125 per pound and decreased during the year to 052 per pound price decreases were driven by a record crop of 34 million tons up 85 from 2011 almond prices began the year at 220 per pound and increased to 290 per pound during the year driven by a decrease in almond production of 

approximately 8 versus 2011 our costs for peanuts and almonds will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to manage price risks for cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas certain dairy products and transportation costs however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore generally it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts and other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities  price risk management and futures contracts on page 38

risk factors 

tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 



although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 



in these markets there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 222 of our total net sales in 2012 mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product 

introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from but are not limited to the following 



we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions we have strategies and plans in place to manage such events if they were to occur including our global supply chain strategies and our principlebased global labor relations strategy if we are unable or if it is not financially feasible to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial staffing and talent and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers 

resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2012 we derived approximately 161 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states additionally 205 of our total consolidated assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31 2012 as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in mexico brazil india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is a critically important part of our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology 

while we believe that our security technology and processes are adequate in preventing security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks disruptions or failure of information technology systems is possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry and civil antitrust lawsuits in the united states could negatively impact our reputation and our operating results 

in 2007 the competition bureau of canada began an inquiry into alleged violations of the canadian competition act  in the sale and supply of chocolate products sold in canada between 2002 and 2008 by members of the confectionery industry including hershey canada inc the us department of justice also notified the company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry but has not requested any information or documents we also are party to a number of civil antitrust lawsuits in the united states including individual class and putative class actions additional information about these proceedings is contained in item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violations are subject to civil andor criminal fines and other sanctions class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments including in some cases payment of treble damages 

andor attorneys fees to the successful plaintiff additionally negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our companys brands and reputation possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products these possible consequences in our opinion should not materially impact our financial position or liquidity but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued or paid respectively 

pension costs or funding requirements could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements for our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts a significant increase in pension expense in pension settlement losses or in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for more information refer to page 41

legal proceedings   

tableend in 2007 the competition bureau of canada began an inquiry into alleged violations of the canadian competition act  in the sale and supply of chocolate products sold in canada between 2002 and 2008 by members of the confectionery industry including hershey canada inc the us department of justice also notified the company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry but has not requested any information or documents 

subsequently 13 civil lawsuits were filed in canada and 91 civil lawsuits were filed in the united states against the company the lawsuits were instituted on behalf of direct purchasers of our products as well as indirect purchasers that purchase our products for use or for resale several other chocolate and confectionery companies were named as defendants in these lawsuits as they also were the subject of investigations andor inquiries by the government entities referenced above the cases seek recovery for losses suffered as a result of alleged conspiracies in restraint of trade in connection with the pricing practices of the defendants the canadian civil cases were settled in 2012 the canadian competition bureau investigation remains pending however hershey canada inc has reached a tentative settlement agreement with the canadian government with regard to its investigation and the company has accrued a liability related thereto we do not believe the terms of the tentative settlement agreement should have a material impact on the companys results of operations financial position or liquidity 

with regard to the us lawsuits the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation assigned the cases to the us district court for the middle district of pennsylvania plaintiffs are seeking actual and treble damages against the company and other defendants based on an alleged overcharge for certain or in some cases all chocolate products sold in the us between 2003 and 2008 the lawsuits have been proceeding on different scheduling tracks for different groups of plaintiffs 

defendants have briefed summary judgment against the plaintiffs that have not sought class certification the “optout plaintiffs” the plaintiffs that purchased products from defendants directly the “direct purchaser plaintiffs” were granted class certification in december 2012 defendants will conduct expert discovery on liability and damages and brief summary judgment against the direct purchaser plaintiffs through the third quarter of 2013 the hearing on summary judgment for the direct purchaser plaintiffs is scheduled for september 2013 combined with the summary judgment hearing for the optout plaintiffs putative class plaintiffs that purchased product indirectly for resale the “indirect purchasers for resale” have a may 1 2013 deadline to file for class certification putative class plaintiffs that purchased product indirectly for use the “indirect end users” may seek class certification after summary judgment against the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the optout plaintiffs has been resolved no trial date has been set for any group of plaintiffs the company will continue to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 

at this stage we are unable to predict the range of any potential liability that is reasonably possible as a result of the proceedings outlined above competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violations are subject to civil andor criminal fines and other sanctions class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments including in some cases payment of treble damages andor attorneys fees to the successful plaintiff additionally negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our companys brands and reputation possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products these possible consequences in our opinion should not materially impact our financial position or liquidity but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued or paid respectively please refer to item 1a risk factors beginning on page 9 for additional information concerning the key risks to achieving the companys future performance goals 

we have no other material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 

pursuant to the disclosure requirements of the us internal revenue service “irs” revenue procedure 200551 in the second quarter of 2012 the irs assessed an accuracyrelated penalty of 222975 on a reportable transaction understatement for the 2008 tax year and that this penalty was paid in full in 2012 the penalty was imposed by §6662aa of the internal revenue code at the 30 rate determined under §6662ac of the internal revenue code the penalty was imposed for a reportable transaction understatement with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of the sale by the company in 2008 of a 49 interest in its whollyowned subsidiary hershey do brasil ltda were not adequately disclosed under §6011 of the internal revenue code in the companys 2008 federal income tax return

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend executive overview 

results for the year ended december 31 2012 were strong with increases in net sales earnings per share and profitability despite continued macroeconomic challenges net sales increased 93 compared with 2011 due to net price realization and volume increases in the united states and key international markets as we continued our focus on core brands and innovation advertising expense increased 159 for the year supporting core brands along with new product launches net income and earnings per sharediluted also increased at greater rates than our longterm growth targets the investments we have made in both productivity and cost savings resulted in a business model that is more efficient and effective enabling us to deliver predictable consistent and achievable marketplace and financial performance we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid 

adjusted nongaap financial measures 

our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below 1 the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure 3 an explanation of why our management believes these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors and 4 additional purposes for which we use these nongaap measures 

we believe that the disclosure of these nongaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our yeartoyear operating results we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes “ebit” net income and income per sharedilutedcommon stock “eps” when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 

adjusted nongaap financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits recorded during the last four years associated with our business realignment initiatives and impairment charges related to goodwill and certain trademarks nonservicerelated pension expenses are also excluded for each of the last four years along with acquisition closing and integration costs primarily associated with the acquisition of brookside in 2012 and a gain on the sale of certain noncore trademark licensing rights in 2011 

nonservicerelated pension expenses include interest costs the expected return on pension plan assets the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits nonservicerelated pension expenses may be very volatile from yeartoyear as a result of changes in interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets therefore we have excluded nonservicerelated pension expense from our results in accordance with gaap we believe that nongaap financial results excluding nonservicerelated pension expenses will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our ongoing business we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from yeartoyear our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants after 2007 resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable 







summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our gaap income statement 



net sales 

2012 compared with 2011 

net sales increased 93 in 2012 compared with 2011 due to net price realization and sales volume increases in the us and for our international businesses net price realization contributed approximately 57 to the net sales increase sales volume increased net sales by approximately 22 due primarily to sales of new products in the us the brookside acquisition contributed approximately 19 to the net sales increase these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 05 

excluding incremental sales from the brookside acquisition net sales in the us increased approximately 71 compared with 2011 primarily reflecting net price realization along with sales volume increases from the introduction of new products net sales in us dollars for our businesses outside of the us increased approximately 91 in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting sales volume increases and net price realization net sales increases for our international businesses were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

2011 compared with 2010 

net sales increased 72 in 2011 compared with 2010 due to net price realization and sales volume increases in the us and for our international businesses net price realization contributed approximately 35 to the net sales increase primarily due to the impact of list price increases offset somewhat by higher promotional rates sales volume increased net sales by approximately 34 due primarily to sales of new products in the us the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by approximately 03

cost of sales and gross margin 

2012 compared with 2011 

the cost of sales increase of 66 in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher input costs the impact of sales volume increases and higher supply chain costs which together increased cost of sales by approximately 71 an increase in cost of sales of 20 resulted from the brookside acquisition supply chain productivity improvements reduced cost of sales by approximately 25 business realignment and impairment charges of 364 million were included in cost of sales in 2012 compared with 451 million in the prior year 

gross margin increased by 14 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily as a result of price realization and supply chain productivity improvements which together improved gross margin by 41 percentage points these improvements were substantially offset by higher input and supply chain costs which reduced gross margin by a total of 29 percentage points the impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2012 compared with 2011 increased gross margin by 02 percentage points

business acquisitions 

acquisitions of businesses are accounted for as purchases and accordingly their results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions the purchase price for each of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

in january 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of brookside foods ltd “brookside” a privately held confectionery company based in abbottsford british columbia canada as part of this transaction we acquired two production facilities located in british columbia and quebec the brookside product line is primarily sold in the us and canada in a take home resealable pack type at the time of the acquisition annual net sales of the business were approximately 90 million the business complements our position in north america and we are making investments in manufacturing capabilities and conducting market research that will enable future growth

 the excess purchase price over the estimated value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded to goodwill the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes

we included results subsequent to the acquisition dates in the consolidated financial statements if we had included the results of the acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented the effect would not have been material

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school maintains voting control over the hershey company in this section we refer to hershey trust company in its capacity as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school as the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” in addition the milton hershey school trust currently has three representatives who are members of the board of directors of the company one of whom is the chairman of the board these representatives from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management the trust has indicated that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and the company board and not the trust board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

as previously reported pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 

in may 2007 we entered into an agreement with godrej beverages and foods ltd a consumer goods confectionery and food company to manufacture and distribute confectionery products snacks and beverages across india under the agreement we owned a 51 controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd in june 2010 the company and the noncontrolling interests executed a rights agreement with godrej hershey ltd in the form of unsecured compulsorily and fully convertible debentures the company contributed cash of approximately 111 million and the noncontrolling interests contributed 93 million associated with the rights agreement the ownership interest percentages in godrej hershey ltd did not change significantly as a result of these contributions the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd were included in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets in september 2012 we acquired the remaining 49 interest in godrej hershey ltd for approximately 158 million since the company had a controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd the difference between the amount paid and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest of 103 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital and the noncontrolling interest in godrej hershey ltd was eliminated as of september 30 2012

the decrease in noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries from 236 million as of december 31 2011 to 116 million as of december 31 2012 reflected the impact of the acquisition of the remaining 49 interest in godrej hershey ltd in september 2012 and the noncontrolling interests’ share of losses of these entities as well as the impact of currency translation adjustments these decreases were partially offset by the impact of the cash contributed by bauducco the share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries was 96 million for the year ended december 31 2012 74 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and 82 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this was reflected in selling marketing and administrative expenses

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2012 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded in 2012 and included in business realignment and impairment charges the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material with regard to other facilities we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 

we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 

as of december 31 2012 certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program was being held for sale obligations related to the environmental remediation of this real estate have been reflected in our current estimates

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time to manage risks these include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 

we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2012 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including interest rate swap agreements foreign exchange forward contracts and options commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities

in order to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in april 2012 the company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2013 to repay 250 million of 50 notes maturing in april 2013 the weightedaverage fixed rate on these forward starting swap agreements was 24 in may 2012 the company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2015 to repay 250 million of 485 notes maturing in august 2015 the weightedaverage fixed rate on these forward starting swap agreements was 27 

the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a liability of 134 million as of december 31 2012 our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates as of december 31 2012 the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately 110 million 

in march 2009 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 in september 2011 the forward starting interest rate swap agreements which were entered into in march 2009 matured resulting in cash payments by the company of approximately 268 million also in september 2011 we entered into forward starting swap agreements to continue to hedge interest rate exposure related to the term financing these swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 15 notes due november 1 2016 resulting in cash payments by the company of 23 million the losses on the swap agreements are being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the notes 

in december 2010 we terminated forward starting swap agreements which were entered into in august 2010 to hedge the anticipated execution of term financing the swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 4125 notes due december 1 2020 resulting in cash receipts of 135 million the gain on the swap agreements is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the notes

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments or forecasted transactions we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 



the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 



our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds for more information on our major raw material requirements see raw materials  on page 5 the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 



we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements primarily peanuts and almonds we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

during 2012 the average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with 2011 and traded in a range between 117 and 100 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract after trading at 37year highs in early 2011 cocoa prices moderated in 2012 our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2012 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of 014 to a high of 019 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis higher feed prices resulting from the historic drought in the us caused dairy prices to rise starting in july but not to the price levels experienced during 2011 our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

in early 2012 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions however ideal weather in the north american sugargrowing regions caused prices to trade lower in the fall of 2012 as a result refined sugar prices have decreased compared to 2011 trading lower in a range from 054 to 037 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 125 per pound and decreased during the year to 052 per pound price decreases were driven by a record crop of 34 million tons up 85 from 2011 almond prices began the year at 220 per pound and increased to 290 per pound during the year driven by a decrease in almond production of approximately 8 versus 2011 our costs for peanuts and almonds will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs 

commodity position sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10 based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories fixedprice forward contracts and anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 



decreases or increases in fair values from 2011 to 2012 primarily reflected changes in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 



management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions we discuss our significant accounting policies in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 

liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs 

we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 

information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows 





liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products 



pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws beginning january 1 2008 we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits we review the discount rate assumptions and revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans is required to 



pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows   



net periodic pension benefit costs 

we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after 2007 

the increase in net periodic pension benefit cost from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the higher amortization of actuarial losses in the current year in addition to the increase in net periodic pension benefit cost in 2012 the level of lump sum withdrawals during 2012 from two of the companys pension plans by employees retiring or leaving the company resulted in a pension settlement loss of 197 million our service cost and prior service cost amortization is expected to be approximately 07 million higher in 2013 interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss is expected to decrease in 2013 by 53 million due primarily to the lower discount rate in 2012 in addition to expected pension settlement costs of 18 million in 2013 for more information see note 14 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2013 is 406 million the 2012 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 397 million projections beyond 2013 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit cost 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2010 to 2012 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the towers watson ratelink 4090 discount curve 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 



average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above we reduced our 2012 discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 



asset return assumptions 

for 2013 we reduced the expected return on plan assets assumption to 775 from the 80 assumption used during 2012 reflecting lower expected future returns on plan assets we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 25 years prior to december 31 2012 was approximately 84 the actual return on assets was as follows   



the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 



our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 



as of december 31 2012 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index 

for 2012 and 2011 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 214 million in 2012 and 89 million in 2011 primarily to pay benefits under our nonqualified pension plans these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2012 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans for 2013 minimum funding requirements of our pension plans are approximately 28 million 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows   



the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 



for the postretirement benefit plans a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the postretirement benefit obligation 

other postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows   





goodwill and other intangible assets 

we classify intangible assets into 3 categories 1 intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill 

our intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of certain trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions we are amortizing trademarks with finite lives over their estimated useful lives of approximately 25 years we are amortizing customerrelated intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of approximately 15 years we are amortizing patents over their remaining legal lives of approximately 6 years we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 

our intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we do not amortize existing trademarks whose useful lives were determined to be indefinite we conduct impairment tests for other intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 

we evaluate our trademarks with indefinite lives for impairment by comparing their carrying amount to their estimated fair value the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a “relief from royalty payments” methodology this approach 

involves a twostep process in the first step we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark in the second step we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we use to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also adjust the assumptions if necessary to estimates that we believe market participants would use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

based on our annual impairment evaluations we determined that no goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 as a result of operating performance that was below expectations we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets of godrej hershey ltd during the second quarter of 2010 as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows from lower than expected profitability we determined that the carrying amount of godrej hershey ltd exceeded its fair value we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 447 million in the second quarter of 2010 to reduce the carrying value of godrej hershey ltd to its fair value including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests there was no tax benefit associated with this charge 

commodities futures and options contracts 

we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the effect of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows   





the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives including interest rate swap agreements foreign exchange forward contracts and options commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately 128 million after tax as of december 31 2012 this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

income taxes 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets valuation allowances are recorded for deferred income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized valuation allowances are primarily associated with tax loss carryforwards from operations in various foreign tax jurisdictions future changes in judgment and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have unrecognized tax benefits is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state canada and mexico during the second quarter of 2012 the irs completed its audit of our us income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 with no significant adjustments tax examinations by various state taxing authorities could be conducted for years beginning in 2008 we are no longer subject to canadian federal income tax examinations by the canada revenue agency “cra” and mexican federal income tax examinations by servicio de administracion tributaria “sat” for years before 2004 during the third quarter of 2010 the cra commenced its audit of our canadian income tax returns for 2006 through 2009 us canadian and mexican federal audit issues typically involve the timing of deductions and transfer pricing adjustments we work with the irs the cra and the sat to resolve proposed audit adjustments and to minimize the amount of adjustments we do not anticipate that any potential tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

we reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 83 million within the next 12 months because of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements of tax audits 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors beginning on page 9 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

our results for 2012 were strong with solid financial and marketplace results we remain focused on building brands in both the us and key international markets and will make incremental investments in our brands and business capabilities during 2013 while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging we are well positioned to succeed in the marketplace and deliver on our commitments in 2013 

we expect 2013 net sales growth of 5 to 7 including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates net sales will be driven primarily by core brand volume growth the us launch of the brookside  product line in the food drug and mass channels as well as the introduction of new products such as kit kat  minis twizzlers bites  and jolly rancher bites  in key international markets such as china we will extend our portfolio of products with the introduction of hersheys kisses deluxe  and build our sales of hersheys  chocolate products in instant consumable and take home pack types which were introduced in the fourth quarter of 2012 in brazil manufacturing capacity was increased to support geographic expansion of hersheys mais  a chocolatecovered wafer product 

we have good visibility into our cost structure and we expect gross margin to increase in 2013 driven by productivity cost savings initiatives and lower costs for certain major raw materials therefore we expect 2013 gross margin on a reported basis to increase 250 to 270 basis points with expansion of adjusted gross margin expected to be 180 to 200 basis points 

considering this financial flexibility we expect to accelerate our investments in 2013 for advertising gotomarket capabilities and expansion of our insights driven performance initiatives advertising is expected to increase approximately 20 versus last year advertising spending on core us brands is expected to increase by approximately the same percentage as in 2012 incremental advertising in 2013 will support the expanded distribution of brookside  products and innovation in both the us and international markets including increased advertising for the hersheys  brand in china 

we expect to continue investments in 2013 to build on the gotomarket capabilities established over the last few years as well as the consumer insights work underway in key international markets for our five global brands hersheys  reeses  hersheys kisses  jolly rancher  and ice breakers  that we believe can gain strong consumer acceptance around the world additionally we will continue to invest in international selling and marketing functions and support new product introductions with increased levels of consumer promotion and sampling to drive trial and repeat purchases as a result we anticipate that earnings per sharediluted in accordance with gaap will increase 20 to 23 in 2013 compared with 2012 growth in adjusted earnings per sharediluted is expected to be in the 10 to 12 range as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted earnings per sharediluted projections provided below 

note  in the outlook above the company has provided income measures excluding certain items in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes these nongaap measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

in 2012 the company recorded pretax acquisition closing and integration costs of 134 million or 004 per sharediluted related to the brookside acquisition in 2012 the company recorded gaap charges of 763 million or 022 per sharediluted attributable to the next century program and 75 million or 003 per sharediluted of noncash impairment charges associated with trius inc nonservice related pension expense of 206 million or 006 per sharediluted was recorded in 2012 

in 2013 the company expects to record gaap charges of about 10 million to 15 million or 003 to 005 per sharediluted attributable to the next century program nonservice related pension expenses are expected to be approximately 132 million or 004 per sharediluted in 2013 

below is a reconciliation of 2011 and 2012 and projected 2013 earnings per sharediluted in accordance with gaap to nongaap 2011 and 2012 adjusted earnings per sharediluted and projected adjusted earnings per sharediluted for 2013 



outlook for project next century 

in june 2010 we announced the next century program as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure we expect total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs for the next century program of 190 million to 200 million during 2013 we expect to record 10 million to 15 million in program charges associated with the demolition of a former manufacturing facility and preparations for the sale of the property on which the facility was located the next century program is expected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of 65 million to 80 million

marketing strategy and seasonality 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we use our promotional programs to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

in march 2011 we announced a weightedaverage increase in wholesale prices of approximately 97 across the majority of our us puerto rico and export portfolio effective immediately the price increase applied to our instant consumable multipack packaged candy and grocery lines direct buying customers were able to purchase transitional amounts of product into may and we do not expect seasonal net price realization until easter 2012 we expect the full financial impact from this pricing action to impact our earnings in 2012 substantially offsetting increases in input costs 

usually there is a time lag between the effective date of list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales the impact of price increases is often delayed because we honor previous commitments to 

  

planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

raw materials 

cocoa products are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are used to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa products are purchased directly from third party suppliers these third party suppliers source cocoa beans which are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

historically there have been instances of adverse weather crop disease civil disruptions and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that such a disruption would occur in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

during 2011 average cocoa futures contract prices traded in a range between 099 and 155 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract during the first half of 2011 cocoa futures traded at prices that were near 30year highs during the fourth quarter of 2011 cocoa futures prices declined significantly due to a very large west african crop which resulted in a substantial global surplus for the year the table below shows annual average cocoa prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinentalexchange 

 

  

source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the food conservation and energy act of 2008 which is a fiveyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

during 2011 prices for fluid milk ranged from a low of 017 to a high of 021 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices were substantially higher than the prior year due to strong export demand for dairy products and high feed costs our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2011 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions strong demand and high world market prices as a result 

  

refined sugar prices increased significantly compared to 2010 trading in a range from 057 to 064 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 056 per pound and increased late in the year to 125 per pound prices were driven higher by loss of acreage to cotton and corn along with drought conditions negatively impacting this year’s crop yields almond prices began the year at 240 per pound and decreased to 210 per pound during the year driven by record production our costs for peanuts and almonds will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to manage price risks for cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore generally it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts and other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities — price risk management and futures contracts on page 39 

product sourcing 

we manufacture or contract to our specifications for the manufacture of the products we sell in addition we contract with third party suppliers to source certain ingredients we enter into manufacturing contracts with third parties to improve our strategic competitive position and achieve cost effective production and sourcing of our products 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and have rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to our business we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names 

  

we have license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 

 

 backlog of orders 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales nor are the changes from time to time significant 

research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries including the united states mexico brazil and india we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  note 1 summary of significant accounting policies

our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program assures that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with all applicable laws and regulations 

  

through our product excellence program we evaluate the supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls to assure product quality and safety various government agencies third party firms and our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and all applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations 

we made routine operating and capital expenditures during 2011 to comply with environmental laws and regulations these expenditures were not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 11800 fulltime and 2000 parttime employees worldwide collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 4800 employees during 2012 agreements will be negotiated for certain employees at five facilities outside of the united states comprising approximately 61 of total employees under collective bargaining agreements we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume andor consumption if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in these markets there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 223 of our total net sales in 2011 mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace 

  

associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions and have plans in place to manage such events if they were to occur if we are unable or if it is not financially feasible to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2011 we derived approximately 156 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states some of our assets are also located outside of the united states as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in mexico brazil india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is a critically important part of our business operations we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing financial logistics sales marketing and administrative functions these processes collect interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others 

  

we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack our data security management program includes identity trust vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as enforcement of standard data protection policies such as payment card industry compliance we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate critical findings additionally we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification measures we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness 

while we believe that our security technology and processes are adequate in preventing security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks disruptions or failure of information technology systems is possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry could impact our reputation the regulatory environment under which we operate and our operating results 

government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in canada we are cooperating fully with the relevant authorities we are also party to a number of civil antitrust suits in the united states and canada on december 31 2011 hershey canada inc entered into an agreement to settle the canadian lawsuits the settlement is subject to court approval these matters could have a negative impact on our company’s reputation we also may be required to incur further costs associated with these matters andor be subject to fines or damages in addition our costs could increase if we became subject to new or additional governmentmandated regulatory controls these possible actions could negatively impact our future operating results 

pension costs or funding requirements could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements for our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts a significant increase in pension expense in pension settlement losses or in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for more information refer to page 43 

implementation of our project next century program may not occur within the anticipated timeframe andor may exceed our cost estimates in addition annual savings from this initiative may be less than we expect 

completion of the project next century program described in greater detail beginning on page 24 is subject to multiple operating and executional risks including coordination of manufacturing changes and production line startups among others if we are not able to complete the program initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates andor if expected cost reductions from efficiency improvements are not realized our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted we estimate that the project next century program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs in the 150 million to 160 million range over the threeyear implementation period when fully implemented project next century is expected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of 65 million to 80 million

results for the year ended december 31 2011 were strong reflecting our continued success in executing our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable longterm growth net sales and earnings per share increased at rates exceeding our growth targets even as the economic environment continued to be challenging our decision to invest in our business through cost savings initiatives new product introductions and our consumerdriven approach to core brand investments contributed to our strong financial performance and improved market share in 2011

net sales increased 72 in 2011 compared with 2010 due to net price realization and sales volume increases in the us and for our international businesses net price realization contributed approximately 35 to the net sales increase primarily due to the impact of list price increases offset somewhat by higher promotional rates sales volume increased net sales by approximately 34 due primarily to sales of new products in the us the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by approximately 03

cost of sales and gross margin 

2011 compared with 2010 

the cost of sales increase of 90 in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily associated with higher sales volume and significantly higher commodity costs which together increased cost of sales by approximately 8 each contributing about half of the increase increases in other supply chain costs were essentially offset by productivity improvements business realignment and impairment charges of 451 million were included in cost of sales in 2011 compared with 137 million in the prior year contributing approximately 1 of the cost of sales increase 

gross margin decreased by 10 percentage point in 2011 compared with 2010 higher commodity and other supply chain costs reduced gross margin by about 32 percentage points substantially offset by productivity improvements and price realization of approximately 28 percentage points supply chain productivity and net price realization each contributed approximately half of this gross margin improvement the impact of higher business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2011 compared with 2010 reduced gross margin by 06 percentage points 

  

2010 compared with 2009 

the cost of sales increase of 03 was associated with sales volume increases resulting in higher cost of sales of about 4 increased supply chain costs and slightly higher input costs also contributed to the cost of sales increase these increases were substantially offset by cost decreases resulting from supply chain productivity improvements a favorable sales mix and lower product obsolescence costs which reduced cost of sales by a total of approximately 45 business realignment and impairment charges of 137 million were included in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 101 million in the prior year 

the gross margin improvement of 39 percentage points resulted from favorable price realization of about 2 percentage points supply chain productivity improvements of approximately 2 percentage points and lower product obsolescence costs of approximately 1 percentage point these increases in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of higher supply chain and input costs which reduced gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point

 capital structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have one vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board of directors with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition the milton hershey school trust currently has three representatives who are members of the board of directors of the company one of whom is the chairman of the board these representatives from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management the trust has indicated that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and the company board and not the trust board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 

in may 2007 we entered into an agreement with godrej beverages and foods ltd one of india’s largest consumer goods confectionery and food companies to manufacture and distribute confectionery products snacks and beverages across india under the agreement we own a 51 controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd in january 2009 the company contributed cash of approximately 87 million to godrej hershey ltd and

liquidity and capital resources

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2011 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 

 

 in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties as of december 31 2011 we did not have any material obligations with european financial institutions our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations 

we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations total obligations for each year presented above consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2011 

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2011 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

lease obligations 

lease obligations include the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for retail stores warehouse and distribution facilities offices and certain equipment 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished plans associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program may require the removal of asbestos the estimated liability associated with the possible removal of asbestos from the facility is not material and is included in our estimates with regard to other 

  

facilities we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to those facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 

as of december 31 2011 certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which have not been reflected in our current estimates 

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 36 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time to manage risks these include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 

we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 

in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

  

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2011 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and options commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2011 note 1 note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2011 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 

 we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2011 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 

in march 2009 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 in september 2011 the forward starting interest rate swap agreements which were entered into in march 2009 matured resulting in cash payments by the company of approximately 268 million also in september 2011 we entered into forward starting swap agreements to continue to hedge interest rate exposure related to the term financing these swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 15 notes due november 1 2016 resulting in cash payments by the company of 23 million the losses on the swap agreements are being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the notes 

in december 2010 we terminated forward starting swap agreements which were entered into in august 2010 to hedge the anticipated execution of term financing the swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 4125 notes due december 1 2020 resulting in cash receipts of 135 million the gain on the swap agreements is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the notes 

for more information see note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

  

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 

 

 the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 

 

 our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds for more information on our major raw material requirements see raw materials on page 5 the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

during 2011 average cocoa futures contract prices traded in a range between 099 and 155 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract during the first half of 2011 cocoa futures traded at prices that were near 30year highs during the fourth quarter of 2011 cocoa futures prices declined significantly due to a very large west african crop which resulted in a substantial global surplus for the year our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

during 2011 prices for fluid milk ranged from a low of 017 to a high of 021 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices were substantially higher than the prior year due to strong export demand for dairy products and high feed costs our costs for certain dairy products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

in 2011 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions strong demand and high world market prices as a result refined sugar prices increased significantly compared to 2010 trading in a range from 057 to 064 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 056 per pound and increased late in the year to 125 per pound prices were driven higher by loss of acreage to cotton and corn along with drought conditions negatively impacting this year’s crop yields almond prices began the year at 240 per pound and decreased to 210 per pound during the year driven by record production our costs for peanuts and almonds will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

  

commodity position sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10 based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories priced forward contracts and anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 

 decreases or increases in fair values from 2010 to 2011 primarily reflected changes in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions we discuss our significant accounting policies in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions our primary concentrations of credit risk are associated with mclane company inc and walmart stores inc mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 172 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2011 mclane company inc 

  

accounted for approximately 135 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 no other customers accounted for more than 10 of our total accounts receivable we believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 

accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following 

 

  

  

 we monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks estimates with regard to the collectability of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 

information on our accounts receivable—trade related expenses and assumptions is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 

liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs 

we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition

 pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we also sponsor two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

  

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws beginning january 1 2008 we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits we review the discount rate assumptions and revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans is required to 

 

  

  

  

 pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

   

net periodic pension benefit costs 

we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost better reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans particularly since our most significant plans have been closed to new entrants since 2007 and 2008 and are well funded in 2012 our adjusted nongaap results will exclude the interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss or gain components of net periodic pension benefit cost 

the increased service cost and amortization of prior service cost from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to declining discount rates the lower interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in the value of assets reflecting the actual return on assets and pension plan contributions our service cost and prior service cost amortization is expected to be approximately 08 million higher in 2012 interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss is expected to increase in 2012 by 138 million due to the lower actual return on plan assets and lower discount rate in 2011 in addition to expected pension settlement costs of 20 million in 2012 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2012 is 391 million the 2011 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 280 million projections beyond 2012 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit cost 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2011 and 2010 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the towers watson ratelink 4090 discount curve for 2009 the rate of discount was determined by our actuaries using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve we changed to the towers watson ratelink discount curve in 2010 to obtain more transparency into the underlying securities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 

 

  

 average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above we reduced our 2011 discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 

 

  

   

asset return assumptions 

we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 24 years prior to december 31 2011 was approximately 82 the actual return on assets was as follows 

 

 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 

 

  

 our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2011 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index 

for 2011 and 2010 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 89 million in 2011 and 61 million in 2010 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our nonqualified pension plans these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2011 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans for 2012 there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and currently planned voluntary funding of our pension plans in 2012 is not material 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

   

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 

 

  

 for the domestic postretirement benefit plan a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the postretirement benefit obligation 

other postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows 

 

  

  

 goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill for intangible assets with finite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we use to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also adjust the assumptions if necessary to estimates that we believe market participants would use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we perform annual impairment tests of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist as a result of operating performance that was below expectations we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with godrej hershey ltd during the second quarter of 2010 based on this evaluation we recorded a 

  

noncash goodwill impairment charge of 447 million in the second quarter of 2010 including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests we determined that none of our goodwill was impaired as of december 31 2011 the fair value of our godrej hershey ltd reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11 as of december 31 2011 the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately 237 million the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth profitability and related cash flows along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit we also considered assumptions that market participants may use by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

our other intangible assets consist primarily of customerrelated intangible assets patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we amortize customerrelated intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a “relief from royalty payments” methodology this approach involves two steps in the first step we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark in the second step we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist we determined that none of our other intangible assets was impaired as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

commodities futures and options contracts 

we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows 

 

   

  

  

 the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately 713 million after tax as of december 31 2011 this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

subsequent event 

in january 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of brookside foods ltd “brookside” a privately held confectionery company based in abbottsford british columbia canada at a purchase price of 175 million canadian dollars 

brookside is a chocolate confectionery company with products based on a unique formula for making chocolatecovered fruit juice pieces brookside holds patents that enable it to make the centers of these products from real fruit juice brookside also makes traditional chocolatecovered nuts and dried fruit 

the products are made at two facilities in british columbia and quebec the brookside product line is primarily sold in the us and canada in a take home resealable pack type annual net sales of the business are approximately 90 million the business complements our position in north america and we expect to make investments in manufacturing capabilities and conduct market research that will enable future growth 

the accounting for the brookside acquisition was incomplete at the time we issued our financial statements accordingly it is impracticable for us to make certain business combination disclosures such as the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets or liabilities arising from contingencies and the amount of goodwill and intangibles acquired and the amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

in 2012 we will continue with the distribution and rollout of hershey’s air delight chocolates expand the pieces and minis platform to include hershey’s milk chocolate with almond pieces and rolo minis other new product launches include ice breakers duos mints and jolly rancher crunch ‘n chew candy 

during 2012 we will continue to remain focused on building brands in both the us and key international markets and will make the necessary investments to ensure that we are positioned to grow our brands and manage challenges we have planned merchandising and programming events throughout the year and will work closely with retail customers and monitor our brand performance given the higher price points for seasonal candy in 2012 in 2012 we expect advertising to increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year supporting new product launches core brands in both the us and international markets and new advertising campaigns on the jolly rancher and rolo brands excluding the brookside acquisition we expect volume to be slightly up for the full year 2012 resulting in net sales growth of about 5 to 7 including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

  

in 2012 the company expects reported earnings per sharediluted of 279 to 289 reported earnings per sharediluted includes anticipated business realignment and impairment charges of 016 to 019 per sharediluted related to the next century program reported gross margin reported ebit margin and reported earnings per sharediluted will be impacted by these charges in addition to closing and integration costs related to the brookside acquisition estimated at 004 to 005 per sharediluted we expect reported gross margin to increase approximately 90 basis points in 2012 

in 2011 the actual return on pension plan assets was below our plan assumption and discount rates were lower which will result in higher nonservice related pension costs in 2012 therefore we expect nonservice related pension expenses of 19 million in 2012 or 005 per sharediluted these expenses include interest on plan participants’ previously earned account balances offset by expected earnings on plan assets actuarial gains or losses caused by interest rate changes and variations in pension asset performance and settlement costs which accelerate the recognition of actuarial gains and losses when participants withdraw funds from the plans the company’s defined benefit plans are well funded and have been closed to new entrants since 2007 and 2008 this results in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable compared to the nonservice related expenses which can be very volatile the company believes that adjusted net income and earnings per sharediluted which excludes nonservice related pension expenses will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing business and therefore will be excluded beginning in 2012 the historical details of these expenses is available on the company’s website within the investors section 

we have good visibility into our fullyear cost structure and despite higher input costs in 2012 we expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 75 basis points driven by productivity and cost savings as well as net price realization therefore we expect fullyear adjusted earnings per sharediluted including the adjustment for nonservice related pension expenses to increase 9 to 11 

note  in the outlook above the company has provided income measures excluding certain items in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes these nongaap measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

in 2011 the company recorded gaap charges of 492 million or 013 per sharediluted attributable to the next century program and the global supply chain transformation program additionally in the third quarter of 2011 the company recorded a pretax gain of 170 million or 005 per sharediluted from the sale of trademark licensing rights in 2012 the company expects to record total gaap charges of about 55 million to 65 million or 016 to 019 per sharediluted attributable to the next century program in 2012 acquisition closing and integration costs related to the brookside acquisition are expected to be 004 to 005 per sharediluted and nonservice related pension expenses are expected to be 190 million or 005 per sharediluted 

below is a reconciliation of gaap and nongaap items to the company’s 2010 and 2011 adjusted earnings per sharediluted and projected adjusted earnings per sharediluted for 2012 

 

   

outlook for project next century 

in june 2010 we announced the next century program as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure we now expect total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs for the next century program of 150 million to 160 million during 2012 we expect to record 55 million to 65 million in program charges during 2012 we now expect capital expenditures for the next century program to be approximately 65 million to 70 million depreciation and amortization for 2012 is estimated to be 195 million to 205 million excluding accelerated depreciation of 20 million to 25 million related to the next century program when fully implemented the next century program is expected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of 65 million to 80 million 

new accounting pronouncements 

during 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued several accounting standards updates which are as follows 

in may 2011 the fasb issued an update which was intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” the amendments in this update result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and ifrs the update explains how to measure fair value and does not require additional measurements this update is effective for our company as of january 1 2012 and may require certain additional disclosures associated with our fair value measures 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an update intended to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of gaap and ifrs as a result companies have a choice of presenting net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements we are currently evaluating the impact and will adopt this update in the first quarter 2012 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an update intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment under certain circumstances a twostep impairment test may be unnecessary this update is effective for our company as of january 1 2012 and we are currently evaluating the impact on our testing of goodwill for impairment

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2011 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

 

   

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders 

the hershey company 

we have audited the hershey company and subsidiaries the “company” internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso  the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of the hershey company and subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2011 and our report dated february 17 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

customers 

fulltime sales representatives and food brokers sell our products to our customers our customers are mainly wholesale distributors chain grocery stores mass merchandisers chain drug stores vending companies wholesale clubs convenience stores dollar stores concessionaires department stores and natural food stores our customers then resell our products to endconsumers in over 2 million retail outlets in north america and 

  

other locations worldwide in 2010 sales to mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers amounted to approximately 221 of our total net sales mclane company inc is the primary distributor of our products to walmart stores inc 

marketing strategy and seasonality 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products we devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we use our promotional programs to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

in august 2008 we announced an increase in wholesale prices across the united states puerto rico and export chocolate and sugar confectionery lines this price increase was effective immediately and represented a weightedaverage 11 increase on our instant consumable multipack and packaged candy lines these changes approximated a 10 increase over the entire domestic product line 

in january 2008 we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately this price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines and represented a weightedaverage increase of approximately 13 on these items these price changes approximated a 3 increase over our entire domestic product line 

usually there is a time lag between the effective date of list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales the impact of price increases is often delayed because we honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

raw materials 

cocoa products are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are used to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa products are purchased directly from third party suppliers these third party suppliers source cocoa beans which are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 65 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

  

historically there have been instances of adverse weather crop disease civil disruptions and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that such a disruption would occur in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

during 2010 the average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2009 and traded in a range between 126 and 153 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract cocoa futures prices during 2010 traded at prices that were near 30year highs the sustained high cocoa futures prices reflected concern over longterm growth capabilities in the ivory coast and continued interest in commodities as an investment by various hedge funds the table below shows annual average cocoa prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinentalexchange 

 

  

source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the food conservation and energy act of 2008 which is a fiveyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

during 2010 prices for dairy products started the year slightly above 14 per pound and increased to approximately 18 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices are stronger in the face of strong demand for dairy products and tight supply of butterfat our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2010 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions strong demand and high world market prices as a result refined sugar prices increased significantly trading in a range from 48 to 66 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 46 per pound and increased late in the year to 56 per pound due to the subpar yield for the current year’s crop almond prices began the year at 195 per pound and increased to 240 per pound during the year driven by strong demand our costs for peanuts and almonds will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts to manage price risks for cocoa 

  

products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore generally it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts and other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities—price risk management and futures contracts on page 39 

product sourcing 

we manufacture or contract to our specifications for the manufacture of the products we sell in addition we contract with third party suppliers to source certain ingredients we enter into manufacturing contracts with third parties to improve our strategic competitive position and determine cost effective production and sourcing of our products 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america we sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations 

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and have rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to our business 

we have license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell and distribute certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 

 

 we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names 

  

backlog of orders 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales nor are the changes from time to time significant 

research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of commerce and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the united states 

our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program assures that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with all applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate the supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls to assure product quality and safety various government agencies third party firms and our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and all applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations 

we made routine operating and capital expenditures during 2010 to comply with environmental laws and regulations these expenditures were not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 11300 fulltime and 2200 parttime employees worldwide collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 4800 employees during 2011 agreements will be negotiated for certain employees at five facilities primarily outside of the united states comprising approximately 52 of total employees under collective bargaining agreements we believe that our employee relations are good 

financial information by geographic area 

our principal operations and markets are located in the united states the percentage of total consolidated net sales for our businesses outside of the united states was 152 for 2010 143 for 2009 and 144 for 2008 the percentage of total consolidated assets outside of the united states as of december 31 2010 was 148 and as of december 31 2009 was 175 operating profit margins vary among individual products and product groups

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for our products or 

  

cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers our continued success is impacted by many factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 221 of our total net sales in 2010 reflecting the continuing consolidation of our customer base in this environment there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

disruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions and have plans in place to manage such events if they were to occur if we are unable or if it is not financially feasible to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers 

  

sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue or a possible increase in bad debt expense 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2010 we derived approximately 152 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states some of our assets are also located outside of the united states as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in mexico india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is an important part of our business operations we use information technology to manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place however a disruption or failure could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry could impact our reputation the regulatory environment under which we operate and our operating results 

government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in certain jurisdictions we are cooperating fully with all relevant authorities we are also party to a number of civil antitrust suits in the united states and canada these allegations could have a negative impact on our company’s reputation we also may be required to incur defense costs in litigation andor be subject to fines or damages in addition our costs could increase if we became subject to new or additional governmentmandated regulatory controls these possible actions could negatively impact our future operating results 

pension costs or funding requirements could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements for our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts a significant increase in pension expense in pension settlement losses or in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for more information refer to page 43 

implementation of our project next century program may not occur within the anticipated timeframe andor may exceed our cost estimates in addition annual savings from this initiative may be less than we expect 

completion of the project next century program is subject to multiple operating and executional risks including coordination of manufacturing changes and production line startups among others if we are not able to complete the program initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates andor if expected cost reductions from efficiency improvements are not realized our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted we estimate that the project next century program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs in the 140 million to 170 million range over the threeyear implementation period when fully implemented project next century is expected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of 60 million to 80 million

summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our income statement 

 

 net sales 

2010 compared with 2009 

net sales increased 70 due to sales volume increases of approximately 4 primarily for core brands in the us and sales of new products favorable price realization increased net sales by over 2 our international businesses contributed to sales growth during the year as a result of sales volume gains or in certain markets favorable price realization partially offset by sales volume declines overall sales volume increased for our international business compared with 2009 the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by about 1 

2009 compared with 2008 

the increase in net sales resulted from list price increases and reduced rates of promotional allowances that resulted in favorable price realization of approximately 10 these increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of approximately 6 associated with pricing elasticity and the rationalization of certain products and businesses in the united states net sales growth was primarily contributed by core brands particularly hershey’s  reese’s  twizzlers and kit kat  which benefited from our consumerdriven strategy including advertising and instore selling merchandising and programming sales increases in local currency for our international businesses particularly in mexico canada and brazil were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced total net sales by approximately 10 the acquisition of van houten singapore increased 2009 net sales by 120 million or 02

cost of sales and gross margin 

2010 compared with 2009 

the cost of sales increase of 03 was associated with sales volume increases resulting in higher cost of sales of about 4 increased supply chain costs and slightly higher input costs also contributed to the cost of sales increase these increases were substantially offset by cost decreases resulting from supply chain productivity improvements a favorable sales mix and lower product obsolescence costs which reduced cost of sales by a total of approximately 45 business realignment and impairment charges of 137 million were included in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 101 million in the prior year 

the gross margin improvement of 39 percentage points resulted from favorable price realization of about 2 percentage points supply chain productivity improvements of approximately 2 percentage points and lower product obsolescence costs of approximately 1 percentage point these increases in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of higher supply chain and input costs which reduced gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point 

2009 compared with 2008 

the decrease in cost of sales was caused by volume declines of approximately 6 resulting from price elasticity higher input costs resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately 4 as higher raw material and pension costs more than offset productivity gains and lower product obsolescence costs during 2009 a reduction in inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in a liquidation of applicable lastin firstout “lifo” inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years this lifo liquidation resulted in a 127 million cost of sales decrease lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 also contributed to the cost of sales decrease business realignment charges of 101 million were included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 778 million in the prior year which had the effect of reducing cost of sales by approximately 2 

gross margin increased 45 percentage points favorable price realization and supply chain productivity improved gross margin by approximately 7 percentage points while higher input costs and pension expense reduced gross margin by approximately 3 percentage points lower business realignment costs in 2009 increased gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point 

selling marketing and administrative 

2010 compared with 2009 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased 2178 million or 180 in 2010 the increase was primarily a result of higher advertising and other marketing expenses which increased a total of 1711 million or 410 versus 2009 advertising expense increased 622 compared with 2009 an increase in other selling marketing and administrative expenses was associated with higher selling expenses increased legal costs and higher administrative expenses for our international businesses including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates these increases were offset somewhat by lower costs related to the consideration of potential acquisitions and divestitures in 2010 business realignment charges of 15 million were included in selling marketing and administrative expenses in 2010 compared with 61 million in 2009 

2009 compared with 2008 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expense and increases in administrative and selling costs principally associated with higher pension and incentive 

  

compensation expenses an increase in advertising expense of approximately 50 was slightly offset by lower consumer promotions costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions and divestitures increased selling marketing and administrative expenses by approximately 110 million in 2009 compared with 2008 business realignment and impairment charges of 61 million were included in selling marketing and administrative expenses in 2009 compared with 81 million in 2008 

business realignment and impairment charges 

in june 2010 we announced project next century the “next century program” as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure as part of the program production will transition from the company’s centuryold facility at 19 east chocolate avenue in hershey pennsylvania to a planned expansion of the west hershey facility which was built in 1992 production from the 19 east chocolate avenue plant as well as a portion of the workforce will be relocated to the west hershey facility this change is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 500 to 600 jobs at the two facilities as investments in technology and automation result in enhanced efficiency 

we estimate that the next century program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs of 140 million to 170 million over three years this estimate includes 120 million to 150 million in pretax business realignment and impairment charges and approximately 20 million in project implementation and startup costs 

during the second quarter of 2010 we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with godrej hershey ltd based on this evaluation we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 447 million including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive threeyear supply chain transformation program the “global supply chain transformation program” or “gsct” in december 2007 we initiated a business realignment program associated with our business in brazil in december 2008 we approved a modest expansion in the scope of the global supply chain transformation program to include the closure of two subscale manufacturing facilities of artisan confections company a whollyowned subsidiary we refer to these programs as “the 2007 business realignment initiatives”

godrej hershey ltd goodwill impairment 

as a result of recent operating performance that was below expectations we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets of godrej hershey ltd during the second quarter of 2010 while godrej hershey ltd has achieved growth it has been less than initial expectations due to slower realization of development plans and changes in input costs as well as the macroeconomic environment which delayed distribution expansion and the implementation of new price points as a result of reduced expectations 

  

for future cash flows from lower than expected profitability we determined that the carrying amount of godrej hershey ltd exceeded its fair value as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 447 million to reduce the carrying value of godrej hershey ltd to its fair value including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests there was no tax benefit associated with this charge for more information on our accounting policies for goodwill and other intangible assets see pages 47 and 48

 capital structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have one vote per share holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board of directors with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” maintains voting control over the hershey company in addition the milton hershey school trust currently has three representatives who are members of the board of directors of the company one of whom is the chairman of the board these representatives from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company’s board may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management the trust has indicated that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and the company board and not the trust board is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance 

the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of 

  

the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

in december 2000 our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement and declared a dividend of 1 right “right” for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 26 2000 the rights at no time had voting power or received dividends the issuance of the rights had no dilutive effect did not affect reported earnings per share and was not taxable the rights did not change the manner in which our common stock was traded the rights expired on december 15 2010 

noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries

in may 2007 we entered into an agreement with godrej beverages and foods ltd to manufacture and distribute confectionery products snacks and beverages across india under the agreement we own a 51 controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd in january 2009 the company contributed cash of approximately 87 million to godrej hershey ltd and owners of the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd contributed approximately 73 million in june 2010 the company and the noncontrolling interests executed a rights agreement with godrej hershey ltd in the form of unsecured compulsorily and fully convertible debentures the company contributed cash of approximately 111 million and the noncontrolling interests contributed 93 million associated with the rights agreement the ownership interest percentages in godrej hershey ltd did not change significantly as a result of the contributions in 2009 and 2010 the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd are included in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

 registration statements 

 

   

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2010 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 

 

 in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations 

we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations total obligations for each year presented above consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2010 

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2010 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations current regulations 

  

require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished plans associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program may require the removal of asbestos the estimated liability associated with the possible removal of asbestos from the facility is not material and is included in our estimates with regard to other facilities we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to those facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 

as of december 31 2010 certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which have not been reflected in our current estimates 

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 36 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts to manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures respectively we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods these futures and options contracts are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

  

as of december 31 2010 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures and options contracts as cash flow hedges additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2010 note 1 note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2010 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 

 we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2010 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 

in march 2009 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 to repay 250 million of 53 notes maturing in september 2011 the weightedaverage fixed rate on the forward starting swap agreements was 35 the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a net liability of 89 million as of december 31 2010 our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates as of december 31 2010 the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately 35 million 

in december 2010 we terminated forward starting swap agreements which were entered into in august 2010 to hedge the anticipated execution of term financing the swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 4125 notes due december 1 2020 resulting in cash receipts of 135 million the 135 million gain on the swap agreements will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the notes

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

  

foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 

 

 we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 

 

 our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

during 2010 the average cocoa futures contract prices increased slightly compared with 2009 and traded in a range between 126 and 153 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract cocoa futures prices during 2010 traded at prices which were near 30year highs the sustained high cocoa futures prices reflected concern over longterm growth capabilities in the ivory coast and continued interest in commodities as an investment by various hedge funds 

during 2010 prices for dairy products started the year slightly above 14 per pound and increased to approximately 18 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices are stronger in the face of strong demand for dairy products and tight supply of butterfat our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2010 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions strong demand and high world market prices as a result refined sugar prices increased significantly trading in a range from 48 to 66 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

  

commodity position sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10 based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 

 the decrease in fair values from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions we discuss our significant accounting policies in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions our primary concentrations of credit risk are associated with mclane company inc and walmart stores inc mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers mclane company inc accounted for 

  

approximately 161 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2010 walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 145 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 no other customers accounted for more than 10 of our total accounts receivable we believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 

accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following 

 

  

  

 we monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks estimates with regard to the collectability of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 

information on our accounts receivable—trade related expenses and assumptions is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 

liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs 

we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 

information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows

 pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance 

  

plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on our plans we also sponsor two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws beginning january 1 2008 we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits we review the discount rate assumptions and revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans is required to 

 

  

  

  

 pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 net periodic pension benefit costs 

we recorded net periodic pension benefit expense of 357 million in 2010 the decrease from 2009 was primarily due to the significant increase in the value of pension assets reflecting the actual return on pension 

  

assets and contributions during 2009 net periodic pension benefit expense of 489 million recorded in 2009 reflected the significant decline in the value of pension assets during 2008 resulting from volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2008 primarily due to the modifications announced in october 2006 which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december 31 2007 our periodic pension benefit costs are expected to be slightly higher in 2011 we anticipate a remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of one of our pension plans in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of initiatives under the next century program this could impact periodic pension benefit costs for the year 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2011 is 291 million the 2010 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 285 million projections beyond 2011 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit cost income 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2010 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the towers watson ratelink discount curve for 2009 and 2008 the rate of discount was determined by our actuaries using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve we changed to the towers watson ratelink discount curve in 2010 to obtain more transparency into the underlying securities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost income 

 

  

 average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost income as described above we reduced our 2010 discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 

 

  

 asset return assumptions 

during 2011 we will be reducing the expected return on plan assets assumption to 80 from the 85 assumption used during 2010 reflecting lower expected future returns on plan assets we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost income on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset 

  

allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 23 years prior to december 31 2010 was approximately 85 the actual return on assets was as follows 

 

 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost income 

 

  

 our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2010 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index 

for 2010 and 2009 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 61 million in 2010 and 545 million in 2009 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our nonqualified pension plans these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2010 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans for 2011 there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and currently planned voluntary funding of our pension plans in 2011 is not material 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 

 

  

   

for the domestic postretirement benefit plan a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the postretirement benefit obligation 

other postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows 

 

  

  

 goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we perform annual impairment tests of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist as a result of recent operating performance that was below expectations we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with godrej hershey ltd during the second quarter of 2010 based on this evaluation we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 447 million in the second quarter including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests we determined that none of our goodwill was impaired as of december 31 2010 the fair value of our godrej hershey ltd reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 as of december 31 2010 the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately 279 million the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth profitability and related 

  

cash flows along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit we also considered assumptions that market participants may use by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

our other intangible assets consist primarily of customerrelated intangible assets patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we amortize customerrelated intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a “relief from royalty payments” methodology this approach involves two steps in the first step we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark in the second step we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist we determined that none of our other intangible assets was impaired as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 in december 2008 we recorded total noncash impairment charges of 457 million we determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks primarily the mauna loa brand exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates 

commodities futures and options contracts 

we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows 

 

  

  

   

 the amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures and options contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately 207 million after tax as of december 31 2010 this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in 2011 in this environment we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumerdriven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in north america along with investments in our strategic international businesses 

we will continue to focus on our core brands and leverage the company’s scale at retail during 2011 we exited 2010 with momentum and expect to build on our success in 2011 as we have a number of initiatives planned to drive growth across our markets including the us launch of hershey’s drops reese’s minis and other new products we will also continue the disciplined rollout and distribution of the hershey’s and hershey’s kisses brands in select key emerging markets where we are gaining consumer awareness and trial 

in 2011 we expect advertising to increase in the midsingle digits on a percentage basis versus last year supporting new product launches and core brands in both the united states and international markets we expect 2011 net sales growth to be around the top of our 3 to 5 longterm objective 

commodity markets remain volatile and we expect significantly higher input costs in 2011 compared with 2010 we have visibility into our cost structure for 2011 however the risk of cost increases remains for certain inputs such as dairy products which we are not able to effectively hedge we expect to substantially offset higher input costs in 2011 through productivity and cost savings initiatives which are in place and we estimate that 2011 adjusted gross margin will be about the same as in 2010 as a result we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per sharediluted growth to be around the top of our longterm 6 to 8 objective 

note  in the outlook above the company has provided income measures excluding certain items in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes these nongaap measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap rather the company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations 

below is a reconciliation of gaap and nongaap items to the company’s 2010 and projected 2011 adjusted earnings per sharediluted 

 

  

   

outlook for project next century 

in june 2010 we announced project next century as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure we expect total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs for the project next century program of 140 million to 170 million during 2011 we expect to record 45 million to 55 million in program charges during 2011 we now expect capital expenditures for project next century to be approximately 180 million to 190 million depreciation and amortization for 2011 is estimated to be 175 million to 185 million excluding accelerated depreciation of 15 million to 20 million related to project next century when fully implemented project next century is expected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of 60 million to 80 million

marketing strategy and seasonality 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation the consistently superior quality of our products our manufacturing expertise and mass distribution capabilities we also devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we use our promotional programs to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to distribution centers strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

in august 2008 we announced an increase in wholesale prices across the united states puerto rico and export chocolate and sugar confectionery lines this price increase was effective immediately and represented a weightedaverage 11 increase on our instant consumable multipack and packaged candy lines these changes approximated a 10 increase over the entire domestic product line 

in january 2008 we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately this price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines and represented a weightedaverage increase of approximately 13 on these items these price changes approximated a 3 increase over our entire domestic product line 

in april 2007 we announced an increase of approximately 4 to 5 in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately the price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines these products represent approximately onethird of our us confectionery portfolio 

usually there is a time lag between the effective date of list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales the impact of price increases is often delayed because we honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

  

raw materials 

cocoa products are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are used to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa products are purchased directly from third party suppliers these third party suppliers source cocoa beans which are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

historically there have been instances of adverse weather crop disease civil disruptions and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that such a disruption would occur in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

during 2009 the average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2008 and traded in a range between 110 and 152 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract cocoa futures prices during 2009 traded at prices which were near 30year highs the significant increase in cocoa futures prices reflected the impact of a weakening us dollar as compared with other currencies and an increase in asset allocation into commoditybased investments by various hedge funds the table below shows annual average cocoa prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinentalexchange 

 

  

source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the food conservation and energy act of 2008 which is a fiveyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

during 2009 dairy prices started the year near 13 per pound and dropped to approximately 10 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices were weak in the face of strong production of milk and dairy products and sluggish demand worldwide our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2009 sugar supplies in the us continued to be negatively impacted by the 2008 catastrophic explosion at a sugar cane refinery in georgia and by high world market prices as a result refined sugar prices remained firm trading in a range from 38 to 50 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

  

peanut prices in the us began the year around 49 per pound and gradually decreased during the year to 46 per pound due to the effects of last year’s large crop almond prices began the year at 160 per pound and increased to 195 per pound during the year driven by record demand which increased 19 over last year 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts to manage price risks for cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore generally it is not possible to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts to extend coverage for longer periods of time currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities — price risk management and futures contracts on page 39 

product sourcing 

we are the primary manufacturer of the products we sell in addition we contract with third party suppliers to source certain ingredients and finished goods we enter into manufacturing contracts with third parties to improve our strategic competitive position and determine cost effective production and sourcing of our products 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in north america we sell our brands in a highly competitive market with many other multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations 

  

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and have rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to our business 

we have license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 

 

 we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items flavored milks and various other products primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names 

backlog of orders 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales nor are the changes from time to time significant 

research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  note 1 summary of significant accounting policies

our product excellence program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program this program assures that all products we purchase manufacture and distribute are safe are of high quality and comply with all applicable laws and regulations 

through our product excellence program we evaluate the supply chain including ingredients packaging processes products distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary we identify risks and establish controls to assure product quality and safety various government agencies third party firms and our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and all applicable laws and regulations 

environmental considerations 

we made routine operating and capital expenditures during 2009 to comply with environmental laws and regulations these expenditures were not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 12100 fulltime and 1600 parttime employees worldwide collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 5000 employees for which agreements covering approximately 43 of these employees primarily outside of the united states will expire during 2010 we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers continued success is dependent on effective retail execution appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs the ability to 

  

secure adequate shelf space at retail locations and product innovation including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products in addition success depends on our response to consumer trends consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics 

our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 27 of our total net sales in 2009 reflecting the continuing consolidation of our customer base in this environment there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive as is the broader snack market some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

disruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products resulting in a negative impact on our operating results 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions and have plans in place to manage such events if they were to occur if we are unable or if it is not financially feasible to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers sellers or business partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment this could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

political economic andor financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors volatility in food and energy costs sustained global recessions rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact the company’s revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company our customers and our suppliers a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers resulting in disruption to our supply chain andor higher costs and could impact our customers resulting in a reduction in our revenue including a possible increase in bad debt expense 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2009 we derived approximately 143 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states some of our assets are also located outside of the united states as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in mexico india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

information technology is an important part of our business operations we use information technology to manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place however a disruption or failure could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation failure of our systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors loss of customers and sales and could have negative consequences to our company our employees and those with whom we do business 

future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry could impact our reputation the regulatory environment under which we operate and our operating results 

government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in certain jurisdictions we are cooperating fully with all relevant authorities these allegations could have a negative impact on our company’s reputation we also may be required to incur defense costs in litigation andor be subject to fines or damages in addition our costs could increase if we became subject to new or additional governmentmandated regulatory controls these possible actions could negatively impact our future operating results 

pension costs or funding requirements could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements for our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts a significant increase in pension expense in pension settlement losses or in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for more information refer to page 43

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

our results for the year ended december 31 2009 demonstrated excellent progress in a difficult economic environment we exceeded net sales targets while implementing price increases and operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset significant increases in input and employee benefits costs we have essentially completed the global supply chain transformation program and have achieved our objectives we increased advertising investment in our core brands in north america and in certain of our key international markets while also achieving strong growth in adjusted earnings per sharediluted we generated strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid 

net sales increased 32 which was within our longterm growth target the increase was driven by price realization as sales volumes declined at less than expected rates due to pricing elasticity earnings per share growth exceeded our longterm objective and our north american market share increased during the year 

our financial results and marketplace performance for the year indicate that our consumerdriven approach to core brand investment along with necessary pricing actions enable us to continue to meet our longterm financial goals our efforts will remain focused toward implementing our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable longterm growth in the evolving marketplace

adjusted nongaap financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits in 2009 2008 2007 2006 and 2005 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves 

  

  

  

  

   

summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our income statement 

 

 net sales 

2009 compared with 2008 

the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases and a reduction in promotional allowances offset by sales volume decreases primarily in the united states sales volume decreases were associated with pricing elasticity and the rationalization of certain products and businesses sales growth was primarily contributed by core brands particularly hershey’s  reese’s  twizzlers and kit kat  which benefited from our consumerdriven strategy including advertising and instore selling merchandising and programming sales increases in local currency for our international businesses particularly in mexico canada and brazil were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced total net sales by approximately 10 the acquisition of van houten singapore increased 2009 net sales by 120 million or 02 

2008 compared with 2007 

the increase in net sales was attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases substantially offset by sales volume decreases primarily in the united states increased sales in the united states were primarily attributable to our core brands particularly hershey’s and reese’s and incremental sales of new products primarily hershey’s bliss  sales volume increases from our international businesses particularly in india china and the philippines also contributed to the sales increase although were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates net sales for our godrej hershey ltd business increased 372 million or 08 in 2008 reflecting incremental sales for the fullyear compared with results for 2007 which included only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business

the cost of sales decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to sales volume decreases favorable supply chain productivity and lower product obsolescence costs offset substantially by higher input costs particularly for raw materials and pension expense during 2009 a reduction in inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in a liquidation of applicable lastin firstout “lifo” inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years this lifo liquidation resulted in a 127 million cost of sales decrease lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 also contributed to the cost of sales decrease business realignment charges of 101 million were included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 778 million in the prior year 

the gross margin improvement resulted primarily from favorable price realization and supply chain productivity improvements offset partially by increased input costs and pension expense approximately 14 percentage points of the gross margin increase was attributable to the impact of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2009 compared with 2008 

2008 compared with 2007 

the cost of sales increase compared with 2007 was primarily associated with higher input and energy costs and the fullyear cost of sales for godrej hershey ltd which in 2007 included cost of sales for only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business these cost increases were offset partially by favorable supply chain productivity lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 also partially offset the cost of sales increases business realignment charges of 778 million were included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 1231 million in the prior year 

gross margin increased primarily as a result of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2008 compared with 2007 with approximately threequarters of the increase attributable to lower business realignment charges in 2008 favorable price realization and improved supply chain productivity also contributed to the increase but were offset substantially by higher input and energy costs 

selling marketing and administrative 

2009 compared with 2008 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expense and increases in administrative and selling costs principally associated with higher pension and incentive compensation expenses an increase in advertising expense of approximately 50 was slightly offset by lower consumer promotions costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions and divestitures increased selling marketing and administrative expenses by approximately 110 million in 2009 compared with 2008 expenses of 61 million related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives were included in selling marketing and administrative expenses in 2009 compared with 81 million in 2008 

  

2008 compared with 2007 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher costs associated with employeerelated expenses including higher incentive compensation expense increased levels of retail coverage primarily in the united states and expansion of our international businesses higher advertising marketing research and merchandising expenses also contributed to the increase business realignment charges of 81 million were included in selling marketing and administrative expenses in 2008 compared with 126 million in 2007 

business realignment initiatives and impairment charges 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive threeyear supply chain transformation program the “global supply chain transformation program” or “gsct” and in december 2007 we initiated a business realignment program associated with our business in brazil together “the 2007 business realignment initiatives” in december 2008 we approved a modest expansion in the scope of the global supply chain transformation program to include the closure of two subscale manufacturing facilities of artisan confections company a whollyowned subsidiary and consolidation of the associated production into existing us facilities along with rationalization of other select portfolio items the affected facilities were located in berkeley and san francisco california additional business realignment charges related to the expansion in scope were recorded in 2009 and included severance for approximately 150 employees 

the original estimated pretax cost of the program announced in february 2007 was from 525 million to 575 million over three years the total included from 475 million to 525 million in business realignment costs and approximately 50 million in project implementation costs the increase in scope approved in december 2008 increased the total expected cost by about 25 million in addition employee lump sum withdrawals from our defined benefit pension plans resulted in total noncash pension settlement losses of 850 million which consisted of 604 million in 2009 125 million in 2008 and 121 million in 2007 

total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs were 6291 million for the gsct excluding the higher than planned noncash pension settlement losses the gsct total project costs were within the projected ranges the gsct was essentially complete as of december 31 2009 total costs of 991 million were recorded during 2009 costs of 1300 million were recorded in 2008 and costs of 4000 million were recorded in 2007 for this program the current trends of employee lump sum withdrawals from the defined benefit pension plans could result in additional noncash pension settlement losses of 12 million to 18 million in 2010 in addition the manufacturing facilities in naugatuck connecticut reading pennsylvania and smiths falls ontario have been closed and are being held for sale actual proceeds from the sale of these facilities could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in 2010 

in an effort to improve the performance of our business in brazil in january 2008 hershey do brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with pandurata alimentos ltda “bauducco” a leading manufacturer of baked goods in brazil whose primary brand is bauducco business realignment and impairment charges of 49 million were recorded in 2008 and 126 million were recorded in 2007

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” maintains voting control over the hershey company historically the milton hershey school trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy nor had it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management however in october 2007 the chairman of the board of the milton hershey school trust issued a statement indicating that the trust continues to be guided by two key principles first that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and second that the longterm prosperity of the company requires the board of directors of the company and its management to build on its strong us position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth he further stated that the milton hershey school trust had communicated to the company’s board that the trust was not satisfied with the company’s results and that as a result the trust was “actively engaged in an ongoing process the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous company board focus on resolving the company’s current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies” in that release the trust board chairman reiterated the trust’s longstanding position that the company board and not the trust board “is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance” 

arnold g langbo and charles b strauss resigned from the board of directors of the company effective august 10 2009 following a decision by the board of directors to establish a finance and risk management committee that also delegated to such committee responsibilities with respect to reviewing and monitoring the company’s annual plan and certain strategic matters including but not limited to acquisitions and dispositions messrs langbo and strauss decided to resign from the board of directors based on their views expressed before the committee was established that retaining responsibility for these matters with the board of directors as a whole was a better corporate governance structure for the company 

on november 11 2007 we announced that all of the members of our board of directors had resigned except for richard h lenny who was at that time our chairman of the board and chief executive officer david j west who was at that time president of the company and currently serves as our president and chief executive officer and robert f cavanaugh who is also a member of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers governing body of milton hershey school in addition we announced that the milton hershey school trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the bylaws of the company to allow the company’s stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our board of directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors expanded the size of our board of directors from 11 directors to 13 directors and appointed 8 new directors including two who are also members of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers of milton hershey school 

the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

in december 2000 our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement “rights agreement” the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement this action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company under the rights 

  

agreement our board of directors declared a dividend of one right “right” for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 26 2000 the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect will not affect reported earnings per share is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded we discuss the rights agreement in more detail in note 16 capital stock and net income per share  

noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 

as of january 1 2009 the company adopted a financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standard that establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary formerly known as minority interest and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and requires the noncontrolling interest to be reported as a component of equity in addition changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest will be accounted for as equity transactions and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary will be measured initially at fair value 

in may 2007 we entered into an agreement with godrej beverages and foods ltd to manufacture and distribute confectionery products snacks and beverages across india under the agreement we own a 51 controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd in january 2009 the company contributed cash of approximately 87 million to godrej hershey ltd and owners of the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd contributed approximately 73 million the ownership interest percentages in godrej hershey ltd did not change significantly as a result of these contributions the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd are included in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 

we also own a 51 controlling interest in hershey do brasil under the cooperative agreement with bauducco the noncontrolling interest in hershey do brasil is included in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 

the increase in noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries from 317 million as of december 31 2008 to 399 million as of december 31 2009 reflected the 73 million contribution from the noncontrolling interests in godrej hershey ltd and the impact of currency translation adjustments partially offset by a reduction resulting from the recording of the share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests the share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries was 41 million for the year ended december 31 2009 61 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 13 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this was reflected in selling marketing and administrative expenses 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2009 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 

 

 in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations 

we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations total obligations for each year presented above consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2009 

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2009 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

asset retirement obligations 

we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 

as of december 31 2009 certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which have not been reflected in our current estimates 

  

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 36 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts to manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures respectively we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods these futures and options contracts are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2009 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts as cash flow hedges additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2009 note 1 note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

  

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2009 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 

 we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2009 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 

in march 2009 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 to repay 250 million of 53 notes maturing in september 2011 the weightedaverage fixed rate on the forward starting swap agreements was 35 the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of 92 million as of december 31 2009 our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates as of december 31 2009 the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately 49 million for more information see note 6  derivative instruments and hedging activities  

as of december 31 2008 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

  

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 

 

 we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 

 

 our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements we attempt to minimize the effect of future 

  

price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and therefore it is not possible to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts to extend coverage for longer periods of time we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

during 2009 the average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2008 and traded in a range between 110 and 152 per pound based on the prices of futures contracts traded on the intercontinentalexchange cocoa futures prices during 2009 traded at prices which were near 30year highs the significant increase in cocoa futures prices reflected the impact of a weakening us dollar as compared with other currencies and an increase in asset allocation into commoditybased investments by various hedge funds 

during 2009 dairy prices started the year near 13 per pound and dropped to approximately 10 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices were weak in the face of strong production of milk and dairy products and sluggish demand worldwide our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 

we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

commodity position sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10 based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 

 the increase in fair values from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflected higher 2009 prices slightly offset by a decrease in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

  

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions we discuss our significant accounting policies in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers mclane company inc accounted for approximately 225 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total accounts receivable we believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 

accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following 

 

  

  

 we monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks estimates with regard to the collectability of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 

information on our accounts receivable—trade related expenses and assumptions is as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 

liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs

 pension and other postretirement benefits plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on our plans we also sponsor 2 primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws beginning january 1 2008 we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans is required to 

 

  

   

  

 pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 net periodic pension benefit costs 

we recorded net periodic pension benefit expense of 489 million in 2009 the increase from 2008 was primarily due to the significant decline in the value of pension assets during 2008 reflecting volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2008 primarily due to the modifications announced in october 2006 which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december 31 2007 our periodic pension benefit costs in 2010 will be approximately 14 million lower due to the higher actual return on pension assets in 2009 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2010 is 284 million the 2009 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was 336 million projections beyond 2010 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit costs income 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2009 and 2008 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost income 

 

  

   

average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost income as described above we reduced our 2009 discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 

 

  

 asset return assumptions 

we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit costs income on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 22 years prior to december 31 2009 was approximately 83 the actual return on assets was as follows 

 

 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost income 

 

  

 our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2009 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index 

for 2009 and 2008 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 545 million in 2009 and 328 million in 2008 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our nonqualified pension plans these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2009 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans for 2010 there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and planned voluntary funding of our pension plans in 2010 is not material 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 

 

  

 other postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows 

 

  

  

 goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

  

we perform annual impairment tests of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist we determined than none of our goodwill was impaired as of december 31 2009 the fair value of our godrej hershey ltd reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6 as of december 31 2009 the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately 796 million the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth profitability and related cash flows along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit we also considered assumptions that market participants may use by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

our other intangible assets consist primarily of customerrelated intangible assets patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we amortize customerrelated intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of existing trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore we do not amortize them we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a “relief from royalty payments” methodology this approach involves two steps in the first step we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark in the second step we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

we perform annual impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist we determined that none of our other intangible assets was impaired as of december 31 2009 in december 2008 we recorded total noncash impairment charges of 457 million we determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks primarily the mauna loa brand exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates 

commodities futures and options contracts 

we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows 

 

   

  

  

 the amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately 540 million after tax as of december 31 2009 this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in 2010 in this environment we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumerdriven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in north america along with investments in our strategic international businesses 

we expect to increase advertising investment by 25 to 30 behind our core brands and new product introductions we will also continue to invest in consumer insights instore selling merchandising and programming to drive profitable growth for both our company and our customers 

we expect our cost structure to remain at elevated levels in 2010 key commodity markets remain volatile and prices for many commodities are near multiyear highs we have good visibility into our fullyear cost structure for 2010 we also expect to continue to achieve productivity and efficiency improvements along with price realization in 2010 resulting in modestly enhanced margins 

for 2010 we expect to achieve net sales growth within our longterm objective of 3 to 5 and adjusted earnings per sharediluted growth within our longterm objective of 6 to 8 

outlook for global supply chain transformation program 

total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs over the last three years for the gsct were 6291 million the gsct was essentially complete as of december 31 2009 however the current trends of employee lump sum withdrawals from the defined benefit pension plans could result in additional noncash pension settlement losses of 12 million to 18 million in 2010 in addition the manufacturing facilities in naugatuck connecticut reading pennsylvania and smiths falls ontario have been closed and are being held for sale actual proceeds from the sale of these facilities could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in 2010 

subsequent events 

in may 2009 the fasb issued a new standard effective for both interim and annual financial statements ending after june 15 2009 it establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 

  

we adopted this new standard as of july 5 2009 and have evaluated all subsequent events through the date and time our financial statements were issued the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial accounting or reporting no subsequent events occurred during this reporting period that require recognition or disclosure in this filing 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued two statements of financial accounting standards no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets—an amendment of fasb statement no 140 “sfas no 166” and no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r “sfas no 167” 

sfas no 166 addresses how information should be provided about transfers of financial assets the effects of a transfer on a company’s financial position performance and cash flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets sfas no 166 removes the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity and modifies or eliminates certain other provisions related to transfers of financial assets it also establishes additional requirements including a requirement for enhanced disclosures to provide financial statement users with greater transparency 

sfas no 167 amends certain requirements of fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements 

each of these statements has now been included in the fasb codification sfas no 166 is now topic 860 and sfas no 167 is now topic 810 these standards are effective for us as of january 1 2010 we believe there will be no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of these new accounting standards

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation the consistently superior quality of our products our manufacturing expertise and mass distribution capabilities we also devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we use our promotional programs to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to distribution centers strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

in august 2008 we announced an increase in wholesale prices across the united states puerto rico and export chocolate and sugar confectionery lines this price increase was effective immediately and represented a weighted average 11 percent increase on our instant consumable multipack and packaged candy lines these changes approximated a 10 percent increase over the entire domestic product line 

  

in january 2008 we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately this price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines and represented a weighted average increase of approximately thirteen percent on these items these price changes approximated a three percent increase over our entire domestic product line 

in april 2007 we announced an increase of approximately four percent to five percent in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately the price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines these products represent approximately onethird of our us confectionery portfolio 

we announced a combination of price increases and weight changes on certain jolly rancher and twizzlers candy and chocolate packaged candy items in november 2005 these changes went into effect in december 2005 and early 2006 and represented a weightedaverage price increase of approximately one percent over the entire domestic product line when fully effective in the second quarter of 2006 

usually there is a time lag between the effective date of list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales the impact of price increases is often delayed because the company honors previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases in addition promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales 

raw materials 

cocoa products are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans are used to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa products are purchased directly from third party suppliers these third party suppliers source cocoa beans which are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s supply of cocoa beans 

historically there have been instances of weather catastrophes crop disease civil disruptions embargoes and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that such a disruption would occur in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

during 2008 cocoa futures contract prices increased sharply compared with 2007 and 2006 and traded in a range between 86 and 150 per pound based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract cocoa futures prices during 2008 were very volatile and traded at prices which were near 30year highs by midyear primarily reflecting speculative commodity fund trading activity during the fourth quarter of 2008 prices declined somewhat from the midyear highs as a result of an anticipated decrease in demand associated with deteriorating economic conditions in addition to strengthening of the us dollar in relation to other relevant foreign currencies the annual average cocoa futures contract price increased 38 in 2008 compared with 2007 the table below shows annual average cocoa prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the intercontinentalexchange

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs 

the food conservation and energy act of 2008 which is a fiveyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

during 2008 dairy prices came down from unprecedented highs set in 2007 starting the year at nearly 20 per pound and dropping to 15 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices have weakened in response to strong production of milk and dairy products and slowing demand worldwide 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2008 sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by a catastrophic explosion at a sugar cane refinery in georgia and by a smaller sugar beet crop as a result refined sugar prices increased from 29 to 45 per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 63 per pound but gradually increased during the year to 76 per pound due to supply tightness driven by a below average crop during the previous year almond prices began the year at 225 per pound and declined to 190 per pound during the year driven by supply increases reflecting a record crop which produced 9 more volume than the prior year 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts to manage price risks for cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products however the dairy markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and therefore it is not possible to hedge our costs for dairy products by taking forward positions to extend coverage for longer periods of time currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities—price risk management and futures contracts on page 38 

product sourcing 

we are the primary manufacturer of the products we sell in addition we contract with third party suppliers to source certain ingredients and finished goods we enter into manufacturing contracts with third parties to improve our strategic competitive position and ensure the most cost effective sourcing of our products

environmental considerations 

we made routine operating and capital expenditures during 2008 to comply with environmental laws and regulations these expenditures were not material with respect to our results of operations capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall andor result in harm to the company’s reputation negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

increases in raw material and energy costs could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material 

  

and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2008 we announced substantial increases in wholesale prices across our chocolate and sugar confectionery product lines to partially offset significant increases in our input costs since we are honoring previously committed promotions and merchandising events price increases will not be fully effective until the second half of 2009 if our sales volume decreases significantly or if we need to substantially increase promotional spending as a result of these price increases there could be a negative impact on our revenue profitability and cash flows 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers continued success is dependent on product innovation including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products effective retail execution appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs and the ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations in addition success depends on our response to consumer trends consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics 

our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 26 of our total net sales in 2008 reflecting the continuing consolidation of our customer base in this environment there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive as is the broader snack market some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment this could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities these negative 

  

impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

political economic andor financial market conditions in the united states and abroad could negatively impact our financial results 

our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence employment levels availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit consumer debt levels energy costs and other factors continued volatility in food and energy costs a sustained global recession rising unemployment and continued declines in personal spending could adversely impact the company’s revenues profitability and financial condition 

domestic and international financial institutions have reported significant losses as a result of asset writeoffs in addition short and longterm debt investors have become increasingly cautious in providing financing to companies as a result of these two events our company our customers and our suppliers could face difficulty in securing debt financing while governments around the world are enacting measures to support financial institutions and the credit markets there are no guarantees that these efforts will ultimately succeed if they do not increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets could continue this could result in reduced liquidity for our company our customers and our suppliers if current credit market conditions continue the company could experience an increase in bad debt expense or liquidity may be reduced and shortterm financing costs could increase these conditions could impair our ability to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms resulting in higher interest expense or reduced cash flows 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2008 we derived approximately 144 of our net sales from customers located outside the united states some of our assets are also located outside of the united states as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry could impact our reputation the regulatory environment under which we operate and our operating results 

government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in certain jurisdictions we are cooperating fully with all relevant authorities these allegations could have a negative impact on our company’s reputation we also may be required to incur defense costs in litigation or government action andor be subject to fines or damages in addition our costs could increase if we became subject to new or additional governmentmandated regulatory controls these possible actions could negatively impact our future operating results 

pension costs or funding requirements could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements of our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts pension settlement losses of approximately 153 million and 118 million were incurred during 2008 and 2007 respectively and we anticipate additional settlement costs in 2009 as of december 31 2008 our pension benefits obligations exceeded the fair value of our pension plan assets by 408 million a significant increase in pension expense or in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for more information refer to page 42 

annual savings from initiatives to transform our supply chain and advance our valueenhancing strategy may be less than we expect 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive global supply chain transformation program which includes a phased threeyear plan to enhance our manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities we expect ongoing annual savings from this program and previous initiatives to generate significant savings to invest in our growth initiatives and to advance our valueenhancing strategy if ongoing annual savings do not meet our expectations we may not obtain the anticipated future benefits 

implementation of our global supply chain transformation program may not occur within the anticipated timeframe andor may exceed our cost estimates 

completion of the global supply chain transformation program is subject to multiple operating and executional risks including coordination of manufacturing changes production line startups crossborder legal regulatory and political issues and foreign currency exchange risks among others if we are not able to complete the program initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted we estimate that the global supply chain transformation program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs at the upper end of a 575 million to 600 million range over the threeyear implementation period excluding possible increases in pension settlement charges as discussed on pages 49 and 50

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

our results for the year ended december 31 2008 were in line with our expectations and reflect the progress we are making toward implementing our major strategic initiatives net sales grew at an annual rate of 38 marketplace performance improved in response to our continued investment in our core brands we are investing to strengthen our position in the chocolate and confectionery markets in which we compete and build on our marketplace results 

the net sales increase was driven by favorable price realization improved us marketplace performance for our products and sales gains from our international businesses offset somewhat by reduced sales volume in the united states incremental sales from the fullyear results of godrej hershey ltd also contributed to the net sales increase as results for 2007 only included the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business net income and earnings per sharediluted increased substantially compared with 2007 due to lower costs resulting from our business realignment initiatives 

nongaap financial measures—items affecting comparability 

our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below 1 the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure 3 an explanation of why our management believes these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors and 4 additional purposes for which we use these nongaap measures 

we believe that the disclosure of these nongaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our yeartoyear operating results we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes “ebit” net income and income per sharedilutedcommon stock “eps” when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 

items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2008 2007 2006 2005 and 2003 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves 

  

  

  

  

   

summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our income statement 

 

 net sales 

2008 compared with 2007 

the increase in net sales was attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases substantially offset by sales volume decreases primarily in the united states increased sales in the united states were primarily attributable to our core brands particularly hershey’s and reese’s and incremental sales of new products primarily hershey’s bliss  sales volume increases from our international businesses particularly in india china and the philippines also contributed to the sales increase although were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates net sales for our godrej hershey ltd business increased 372 million or 08 in 2008 reflecting incremental sales for the fullyear compared with results for 2007 which included only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business 

2007 compared with 2006 

net sales for 2007 were essentially even with 2006 sales increased for our international businesses primarily exports to asia and latin america as well as sales in canada and mexico the acquisition of godrej hershey ltd increased net sales by 465 million or 09 in 2007 favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales these increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the us reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slowmoving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the us 

key us marketplace metrics 

 

   

consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution include food drug mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc and convenience stores the change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food drug convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade excluding sales of walmart stores inc 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2008 compared with 2007 

the cost of sales increase compared with 2007 was primarily associated with higher input and energy costs and the fullyear cost of sales for godrej hershey ltd which in 2007 included cost of sales for only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business these cost increases were offset partially by favorable supply chain productivity lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 also partially offset the cost of sales increases business realignment charges of 778 million were included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 1231 million in the prior year 

gross margin increased primarily as a result of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2008 compared with 2007 favorable price realization and improved supply chain productivity also contributed to the increase but were offset substantially by higher input and energy costs 

2007 compared with 2006 

business realignment charges of 1231 million were included in cost of sales in 2007 compared with a credit of 32 million included in cost of sales in 2006 the remainder of the cost of sales increase was primarily associated with significantly higher input costs particularly for dairy products and certain other raw materials and the godrej hershey ltd business acquired in may 2007 offset somewhat by favorable supply chain productivity 

the gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in 2007 compared with 2006 resulting in a reduction of 26 percentage points the rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs 

selling marketing and administrative 

2008 compared with 2007 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher costs associated with employeerelated expenses including higher incentive compensation expense increased levels of retail coverage primarily in the united states and expansion of our international businesses higher advertising marketing research and merchandising expenses also contributed to the increase expenses of 81 million related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives were included in selling marketing and administrative expenses in 2008 compared with 126 million in 2007 

2007 compared with 2006 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses project implementation costs related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives contributed 126 million to the increase higher administrative costs were principally associated with employeerelated expenses from the expansion of our international businesses including the impact of the acquisition of godrej hershey ltd 

  

business realignment initiatives and impairment charges 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive threeyear supply chain transformation program the “global supply chain transformation program” and in december 2007 we recorded impairment and business realignment charges associated with our business in brazil together “the 2007 business realignment initiatives” 

when completed the global supply chain transformation program will greatly enhance our manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities reduce inventories resulting in improvements in working capital and generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives these initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core us business creation of innovative new product platforms to meet customer needs and disciplined global expansion under the program which will be implemented in stages over three years we will significantly increase manufacturing capacity utilization by reducing the number of production lines by more than onethird outsource production of low valueadded items and construct a flexible costeffective production facility in monterrey mexico to meet current and emerging marketplace needs the program will result in a total net reduction of 1500 positions across our supply chain over the threeyear implementation period 

the original estimated pretax cost of the program announced in february 2007 was from 525 million to 575 million over three years the total included from 475 million to 525 million in business realignment costs and approximately 50 million in project implementation costs total costs of 1300 million were recorded in 2008 and 4000 million were recorded in 2007 for this program excluding possible pension settlement charges in 2009 and 2010 we now expect total charges for the global supply chain transformation program to be at the upper end of the 575 million to 600 million range reflecting our latest estimates for the cost of the original program and an expansion in scope of the program approved in december 2008 the expansion in the scope of the program will include approximately 250 million associated with the closure of two subscale manufacturing facilities of artisan confections company a whollyowned subsidiary and consolidation of the associated production into existing us facilities along with costs associated with the rationalization of other select portfolio items the affected facilities are located in berkeley and san francisco california these additional business realignment charges will be recorded in 2009 and include severance for approximately 150 impacted employees for more information see outlook for global supply chain transformation program on page 49 

in 2001 we acquired a small business in brazil hershey do brasil that through 2007 had not gained profitable scale or adequate market distribution in an effort to improve the performance of this business in january 2008 hershey do brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with pandurata alimentos ltda “bauducco” a leading manufacturer of baked goods in brazil whose primary brand is bauducco in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and approved a business realignment program associated with initiatives to improve distribution and enhance the financial performance of our business in brazil business realignment and impairment charges of 49 million were recorded in 2008 and 126 million were recorded in 2007

as a result of our annual impairment tests of intangible assets with useful lives determined to be indefinite we recorded total impairment charges of 457 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 certain trademarks primarily the mauna loa brand were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations of these trademarks at the acquisition dates for more information refer to pages 46 and 47 

brazilian business realignment 

the 2008 brazilian business realignment charges and the 2007 employee separation costs were related to involuntary terminations and costs associated with office consolidation related to the cooperative agreement with bauducco during the fourth quarter of 2007 we completed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting primarily from lower expected profitability we determined that the carrying amount of our whollyowned subsidiary hershey do brasil exceeded its fair value and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 123 million in december 2007 there was no tax benefit associated with this charge

income before interest and income taxes and ebit margin 

2008 compared with 2007 

ebit increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of lower net business realignment charges net pretax business realignment charges of 1807 million were recorded in 2008 compared with 4126 million in 2007 the increase in ebit resulting from lower business realignment charges and an increase in gross profit was substantially offset by higher selling marketing and administrative expenses 

ebit margin increased from 93 in 2007 to 115 in 2008 net business realignment and impairment charges reduced ebit margin by 35 percentage points in 2008 and 83 percentage points in 2007 resulting in an improvement in ebit margin of 48 percentage points from 2007 to 2008 this impact was substantially offset by higher selling marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales 

2007 compared with 2006 

ebit decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 principally as a result of higher net business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2007 net pretax business realignment and impairment charges of 4126 million were recorded in 2007 compared with 116 million recorded in 2006 an increase of 4009 million the remainder of the decrease in ebit was attributable to lower gross profit resulting primarily from higher input costs and higher selling marketing and administrative expenses

interest expense net 

2008 compared with 2007 

net interest expense was lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced borrowings as compared to the prior year 

2007 compared with 2006 

net interest expense was higher in 2007 than in 2006 primarily reflecting increased borrowings partially offset by lower interest rates 

income taxes and effective tax rate

financial condition 

our financial condition remained strong during 2008 solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies the financial market turmoil and credit crisis to date have not had a material affect on our business operations or liquidity 

acquisitions and divestitures

capital structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have one vote per share holders of the class b stock have ten votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board of directors with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” maintains voting control over the hershey company historically the milton hershey school trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy nor had it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management however in october 2007 the chairman of the board of the milton hershey school trust issued a statement indicating that the trust continues to be guided by two key principles first that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and second that the longterm prosperity of the company requires the board of directors of the company and its management to build on its strong us position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth he further stated that the milton hershey school trust had communicated to the company’s board that the trust was not satisfied with the company’s results and that as a result the trust was “actively engaged in an ongoing process the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous company board focus on resolving the company’s current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies” in that release the trust board chairman reiterated the trust’s longstanding position that the company board and not the trust board “is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance” 

on november 11 2007 we announced that all of the members of our board of directors had resigned except for richard h lenny who was at that time our chairman of the board and chief executive officer david j west who was at that time president of the company and currently serves as our president and chief executive officer and robert f cavanaugh who is also a member of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers governing body of milton hershey school in addition we announced that the milton hershey school trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the bylaws of the company to allow the company’s stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our board of directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors expanded the size of our board of directors from 11 directors to 13 directors and appointed eight new directors including two who are also members of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers of milton hershey school 

the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

in december 2000 our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement “rights agreement” the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement this 

  

action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company under the rights agreement our board of directors declared a dividend of one right “right” for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 26 2000 the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect will not affect reported earnings per share is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded we discuss the rights agreement in more detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper 

global capital and credit markets including the commercial paper markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption despite this volatility and disruption we have continued to have full access to the tier 1 commercial paper market we believe that our operating cash flow together with our unsecured committed revolving credit facility lines of credit and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet current operating investing and financing needs although there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms

registration statements 

 

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2008 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 

 

 in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations 

we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations total obligations for each year presented above consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2008 

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2008 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

  

asset retirement obligations 

our company has a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 

as of december 31 2008 certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which has not been reflected in our current estimates 

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves from time to time based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 35 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts to manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures respectively we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods these futures and options contracts are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 

we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended “sfas no 133” sfas no 133 provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

  

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2008 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts as cash flow hedges additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2008 note 1 note 5 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2008 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 

 we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2008 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 

in december 2005 we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to 500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006 in february 2006 we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of 250 million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we recorded a gain of 10 million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge in august 2006 a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of 250 million of 10year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of 37 million the 37 million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the 250 million of 545 notes due september 1 2016 

as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 

foreign exchange forward contracts 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

  

foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 

 

 we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 

 

 our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months however the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and therefore there are limited opportunities to hedge our costs by taking forward positions to extend coverage beyond three to six months we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

during 2008 cocoa prices traded in a range between 86 and 150 per pound based on the prices of intercontinentalexchange futures contracts cocoa futures traded at prices which were near 30year highs by midyear primarily reflecting speculative commodity fund trading activity during the fourth quarter of 2008 a reduction in anticipated demand associated with deteriorating economic conditions in addition to strengthening of the us dollar in relation to other relevant foreign currencies resulted in the significant liquidation of cocoa futures positions by speculative commodity funds this resulted in a substantial decrease in cocoa futures market prices near the end of the year 

during 2008 dairy prices have come down from unprecedented highs set in 2007 starting the year at nearly 20 per pound and dropping to 15 per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis prices have weakened in response to strong production of milk and dairy products and slowing demand worldwide 

we account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 133 we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 

   

the decrease in fair values from 2007 to 2008 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions which more than offset the impact of higher prices in 2008 the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forwardlooking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions for a discussion of our significant accounting policies refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers mclane company inc accounted for approximately 273 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2008 as of december 31 2008 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total accounts receivable we believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 

  

accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following

 pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on our plans we also sponsor two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws beginning january 1 2008 we complied with the 

  

funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans to 

 

  

  

  

 we adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 as of december 31 2006 

pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

   

net periodic pension benefit costs 

we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2008 primarily due to the modifications announced in october 2006 which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december 31 2007 we expect to incur periodic pension benefit costs in 2009 of approximately 50 million compared with income of approximately 174 million in 2008 principally as a result of the significant decline in the value of pension plan assets during 2008 reflecting the unprecedented volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gainslosses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2009 is 336 million the 2008 recognized net actuarial gain component of net periodic pension benefit income was 5 million projections beyond 2009 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit income costs 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2008 and 2007 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost 

 

  

 average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit income cost as described above we increased our 2008 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 

 

  

   

asset return assumptions 

we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit income costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 21 years prior to december 31 2008 was approximately 77 the actual return on assets was as follows 

 

 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost 

 

  

 our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2008 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2008 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index and direct exposure to highly volatile risky sectors such as subprime mortgages was minimal 

for 2008 and 2007 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 328 million in 2008 and 158 million in 2007 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our nonqualified pension plans these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2008 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans for 2009 there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

   

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 

 

  

 other postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows 

 

  

  

 goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  this standard classifies intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

our other intangible assets consist primarily of customerrelated intangible assets patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we amortize customerrelated intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore we do not amortize them we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a “relief from royalty payments” methodology this approach involves two steps in the first step we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each 

  

trademark in the second step we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

the company performs annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates we determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks primarily the mauna loa brand exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded total noncash impairment charges of 457 million in december 2008 

as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting from lower expected profitability we determined that the carrying amount of our whollyowned subsidiary hershey do brasil exceeded its fair value and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 123 million in december 2007 there was no tax benefit associated with these charges we discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in note 1 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets with the exception of the aforementioned trademarks and brazil goodwill were impaired as of december 31 2008 and 2007 based on our annual impairment evaluation 

commodities futures and options contracts 

we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations accounting for commodities futures and options contracts is in accordance with sfas no 133 additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows 

 

  

  

  

 the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures and options contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 170 million after tax as of december 31 2008 this amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

  

return measures 

we believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders’ equity and operating return on average invested capital these operating return measures calculated in accordance with gaap are presented on the sixyear consolidated financial summary on page 18 with the directly comparable nongaap operating return measures the nongaap operating return measures are calculated using nongaap income excluding items affecting comparability a reconciliation of net income presented in accordance with gaap to nongaap income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20 along with the reasons why we believe that the use of nongaap income in these calculations provides useful information to investors 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders’ equity to calculate nongaap operating return on average stockholders’ equity we define nongaap income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items these items include the following 

 

  

  

 our operating return on average stockholders’ equity gaap basis was 684 in 2008 our nongaap operating return on average stockholders’ equity was 945 in 2008 the increase in operating return on average stockholders’ equity in 2008 compared with 2007 was principally due to a reduction in equity related to reduced pension plan assets and the impact of cumulative translation adjustments over the last six years our nongaap operating return on stockholders’ equity has ranged from 332 in 2003 to 945 in 2008 

operating return on average invested capital 

operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of longterm debt deferred income taxes and stockholders’ equity 

for the calculation of operating return on average invested capital gaap basis earnings is defined as net income adjusted to add back the aftertax effect of interest on longterm debt for the calculation of the nongaap operating return measure we define earnings as net income adjusted to add back the aftertax effect of interest on longterm debt excluding the following 

 

  

  

 our operating return on average invested capital gaap basis was 190 in 2008 our nongaap operating return on average invested capital was 251 in 2008 over the last six years our nongaap operating return on average invested capital has ranged from 189 in 2003 to 268 in 2005 and 2006 

  

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

during 2008 we announced a new consumerdriven business model with a comprehensive approach intended to deliver sustainable growth over the coming years our financial targets include longterm consolidated net sales growth in the three to five percent range and increases in earnings per sharediluted excluding items affecting comparability at an annual rate of six to eight percent items affecting comparability include business realignment and impairment charges and credits gains or losses on the sale of certain businesses and certain other items 

our net sales growth will primarily leverage our core portfolio of brands in the united states we expect to improve our pricevalue equation through package and product upgrades and merchandising innovation resulting in increased price realization we also expect growth from our international businesses primarily in fastergrowing emerging markets 

for 2009 we expect net sales growth of two to three percent from our pricing actions and core brand sales growth we expect unit sales volume to decline in the united states due to the elasticity effects of price increases implemented during 2008 which will result in higher everyday and promoted prices for consumers the impact of the declines in unit sales volume is expected to be more than offset by price realization we expect growth in net sales for our international business at rates greater than in the united states offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

considering the significant increases in raw material prices and other input costs and the extreme volatility in market prices we expect substantial cost increases in 2009 while commodity spot prices have moderated somewhat we expect costs for our key inputs to remain volatile and above historical averages on a spot basis we now expect our commodity cost basket to increase by approximately 175 million in 2009 compared with 2008 the financial market and credit crisis have not had a material affect on our business operations or liquidity todate however the extraordinary decline in the financial markets in 2008 significantly reduced the fair value of our pension plan assets which is expected to result in an increase in 2009 pension expense of approximately 70 million despite these increases we plan to continue to invest in our core brands in the us and key international markets to build on our momentum specifically advertising expense is expected to increase by 30 million to 35 million in 2009 these cost increases will be more than offset by higher net pricing savings from the global supply chain transformation program and ongoing operating productivity improvement earnings per sharediluted excluding items affecting comparability is expected to increase in 2009 however due to the significant commodity and pension cost increases higher levels of core brand investment spending and current macroeconomic conditions we expect growth to be at a rate below our longterm objective of six to eight percent 

for 2009 we expect total pretax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program including the increase in the scope of the program to be in the range of 45 million to 70 million excluding possible increases in pension settlement charges discussed below total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in 2009 are expected to reduce earnings per sharediluted by 013 to 020 

outlook for global supply chain transformation program 

we expect total pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs for the global supply chain transformation program to be at the upper end of the 575 million to 600 million range this includes pension settlement charges recorded in 2007 and 2008 as required in accordance with financial accounting standards 

  

board statement of financial accounting standards no 88 employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits as amended “sfas no 88” pension settlement charges are noncash charges for the company such charges accelerate the recognition of pension expenses related to actuarial gains and losses resulting from interest rate changes and differences in actual versus assumed returns on pension assets the company normally amortizes actuarial gains and losses over a period of about 13 years 

the global supply chain transformation program charges recorded in 2007 and in 2008 have included pension settlement charges of approximately 246 million as employees leaving the company under the program have been withdrawing lump sums from the defined benefit pension plans these charges are included in the current global supply chain transformation program estimates of 575 million to 600 million 

in addition to the settlement charges reflected above additional sfas no 88 pension settlement charges of up to 65 million may be incurred depending on decisions of impacted hourly employees to withdraw funds during 2009 and 2010 the amount of the potential charges has increased significantly as a result of the recent declines in the financial markets the likely range of possible additional charges for 2009 is zero to 50 million there would be no charge if withdrawals by hourly employees are below the sfas no 88 settlement threshold level and 50 million based on current market conditions if they are above the threshold level 

subsequent event 

on february 16 2009 we announced that kenneth l wolfe our nonexecutive chairman of the board of directors had resigned from our board effective immediately his resignation followed a request from the milton hershey school trust that he not stand for reelection at our annual meeting of stockholders on april 30 2009 the milton hershey school trust indicated that it wanted to have one of its representatives on our board serve as chairman of the board 

our board of directors also announced its unanimous election of director james e nevels to succeed mr wolfe as nonexecutive chairman of our board of directors mr nevels has served on our board since november 2007 

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas no 141r” the objective of sfas no 141r is to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer 

 

  

  

 sfas no 141r is effective for our company as of january 1 2009 we currently do not expect any significant impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows as a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard however the adoption of sfas no 141r will impact the accounting for any business combinations occurring subsequent to december 31 2008 

  

in december 2007 the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51 “sfas no 160” the objective of sfas no 160 is to improve the relevance comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas no 160 is effective for our company as of january 1 2009 we do not expect any significant impact on financial accounting or reporting as a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133 “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how these instruments are accounted for and how they affect the entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows this new standard is effective for our company as of january 1 2009 and we are currently evaluating the impact on disclosures associated with our derivative and hedging activities 

in may 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 162 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles “sfas no 162” sfas no 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we do not expect any significant changes to our financial accounting and reporting as a result of the issuance of sfas no 162

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements

marketing strategy and seasonality 

the foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities product innovation the consistently superior quality of our products our manufacturing expertise and mass distribution capabilities we also devote considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products we have a variety of promotional programs for our customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products we stimulate sales of certain products with promotional programs at various times throughout the year our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year representing seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns 

product distribution 

in conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service we plan optimum stock levels and work with our customers to set reasonable delivery times our distribution network provides for the efficient shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to distribution centers strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico we primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers 

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

in april 2007 we announced an increase of approximately four percent to five percent in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately the price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines these products represent approximately onethird of our us confectionery portfolio this action was implemented to help partially offset increases in input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities and transportation 

  

we announced a combination of price increases and weight changes on certain jolly rancher and twizzlers candy and chocolate packaged candy items in november 2005 these changes went into effect in december 2005 and early 2006 and represented a weightedaverage price increase of approximately one percent over the entire domestic product line when fully effective in the second quarter of 2006 

in december 2004 we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of approximately half of our domestic confectionery line changes that were effective in january 2005 represented a weightedaverage increase of approximately six percent on our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines changes that were effective in february 2005 represented a weightedaverage price increase of approximately four percent on packaged candy the price increases announced in december 2004 represented an average increase of three percent over the entire domestic product line 

raw materials 

cocoa is the most significant raw material we use to produce our chocolate products we buy a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products including cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa beans and cocoa products are purchased directly from third party suppliers cocoa beans are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s supply of cocoa beans cocoa beans are not uniform and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in many growing areas 

historically there have been instances of weather catastrophes crop disease civil disruptions embargoes and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports in the event that such a disruption would occur in any given country we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer 

cocoa beans are processed to produce cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder beginning in 2008 we will predominately purchase cocoa products to meet our manufacturing requirements rather than processing cocoa beans this change to our manufacturing process is the result of a comprehensive supply chain transformation program to enhance manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities that we initiated in 2007 along with ingredient sourcing arrangements entered into during 2007 

during 2007 cocoa prices traded in a range between 74¢ and 95¢ per pound based on the new york board of trade futures contract the table below shows annual average cocoa prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the new york board of trade 

 

  

source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products 

  

the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 which is a sixyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and dairy products because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

during 2007 dairy prices were significantly higher starting the year at nearly 13¢ per pound and rising to 22¢ per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis tight global supplies were driven by drought in australia as well as reduced exports from the european union due to the elimination of subsidies also input costs for us producers were up due to heightened grain prices impacting feed costs additionally the united states department of agriculture adjusted their mechanism for establishing market prices of nonfat dry milk further escalating costs 

the price of sugar is subject to price supports under us farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by users in the us are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2007 sugar supplies in the us improved due to larger sugar beet and sugar cane crops as a result refined sugar prices declined from 31¢ to 29¢ per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

peanut prices in the us began the year around 42¢ per pound but gradually increased during the year to 53¢ per pound due to supply tightness driven by lower planted acreage and dry conditions during the growing season almond prices began the year at 250 per pound and declined to 220 per pound during the year driven by supply increases due to a record crop which produced 19 more volume than the prior year 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts to manage price risks for cocoa beans and cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products however the dairy markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and therefore it is not possible to hedge our costs for dairy products by taking forward positions to extend coverage for longer periods of time currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities — price risk management and futures contracts on page 39 

competition 

many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace we sell our brands in a highly competitive market with many other multinational national regional and local firms some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations 

  

trademarks service marks and license agreements 

we own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and have rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to our business 

we have license agreements with several companies to manufacture andor sell certain products our rights under these agreements are extendible on a longterm basis at our option our most significant licensing agreements are as follows 

 

 various dairies throughout the united states produce and sell hershey’s chocolate and strawberry flavored milks under license we also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell baking and various other products primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names 

backlog of orders 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales nor are the changes from time to time significant 

research and development 

we engage in a variety of research and development activities we develop new products improve the quality of existing products improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning our research and development expense is contained in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of commerce and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the united states 

environmental considerations 

investments were made in 2007 to comply with environmental laws and regulations these investments were not material with respect to our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 11000 fulltime and 1800 parttime employees worldwide collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 4200 employees for which agreements covering approximately 25 of these employees primarily outside of the united states will expire during 2008 we believe that our employee relations are good 

financial information by geographic area

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

annual savings from initiatives to transform our supply chain and advance our valueenhancing strategy may be less than we expect 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive supply chain transformation program which includes a phased threeyear plan to enhance our manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities we expect ongoing annual savings from this program and previous initiatives to generate significant savings to invest in our growth initiatives and to advance our valueenhancing strategy if ongoing annual savings do not meet our expectations we may not obtain the anticipated future benefits 

increases in raw material and energy costs could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa beans cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we use forward contracts and commodity futures contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product size may also result in a reduction in sales volume if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

implementation of our supply chain transformation program may not occur within the anticipated timeframe andor may exceed our cost estimates 

we announced a comprehensive supply chain transformation program in february 2007 which is expected to be completed by december 2009 we estimate that this program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs of 525 million to 575 million over the threeyear period completion of this program is subject to multiple operating and executional risks including coordination of manufacturing changes production line startups crossborder legal regulatory and political issues and foreign currency exchange risks among others if we are not able to complete the program initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

issues related to the quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall resulting in harm to the company’s reputation and negatively impacting our operating results 

in order to sell our iconic branded products we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers issues related to quality and safety of our products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns or related to product contamination or product tampering whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption in addition we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions which could result in payments of fines or damages costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results 

a product recall and related temporary plant closure during the fourth quarter of 2006 was caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier we have filed a claim for damages and are currently in litigation a receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to the anticipated recovery of damages future developments in this case could impact our ability to recover the costs we incurred for the recall and temporary plant closure from responsible thirdparties 

future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry could impact our reputation the regulatory environment under which we operate and our operating results 

government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industries in certain jurisdictions we are cooperating fully with all relevant authorities these allegations could have a negative impact on our company’s reputation we may also be subject to subsequent litigation or government action including payment of fines or damages we may incur increased costs associated with this investigation in addition our costs could increase if we would be required to pay fines or damages or institute additional new governmentmandated regulatory controls these possible actions could negatively impact our future operating results 

  

pension costs could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements of our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts pension settlement losses of approximately 118 million were incurred during 2007 and we anticipate additional settlement costs in 2008 the fair value of our pension plan assets exceeded pension benefits obligations as of december 31 2007 however a significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increases in our stock price could increase expenses 

changes in the price of our common stock expose us to market risks expenses for incentive compensation could increase due to an increase in the price of our common stock 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers continued success is dependent on product innovation including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products effective retail execution appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs and the ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations in addition success depends on our response to consumer trends consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics 

our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for approximately 26 of our total net sales in 2007 reflecting the continuing consolidation of our customer base in this environment there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive as is the broader snack market some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial international operations in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment this could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws 

  

among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2007 we derived approximately 138 of our net sales from customers located outside the united states some of our assets are also located outside of the united states as part of our global growth strategy we are increasing our investments outside of the united states particularly in india and china as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in connection with its pricing practices the company is the subject of an antitrust investigation by the canadian competition bureau and has received a request for information from the european commission in addition the us department of justice is conducting an inquiry the company is also party to approximately 50 related civil antitrust suits in the united states and three in canada each claim contains class action allegations instituted on behalf of consumers and in some cases by certain companies that purchase chocolate for resale that allege conspiracies in restraint of trade and challenge the pricing andor purchasing practices of the company several other chocolate confectionery companies are the subject of investigations andor inquiries by the government entities referenced above and have also been named as defendants in the same litigation one canadian wholesaler is also a subject of the canadian investigation and is a defendant in certain of the lawsuits while it is not feasible to predict the final outcome of these proceedings in our opinion they should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position liquidity or results of operations of the company the company is cooperating with the government investigations and inquiries and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

the year ended december 31 2007 was very difficult we experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities particularly costs for dairy products these cost increases totaled approximately 100 million and reduced gross margin by approximately 240 basis points we also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and tradeup product segments that affected our growth and profitability in the face of these challenges we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core us market additionally we continued to invest in key international markets 

net sales were even with the prior year as increased sales from our international businesses and incremental sales from the acquisition of the godrej hershey foods and beverages company were substantially offset by lower sales in the united states net sales declined in the united states primarily as a result of increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity income and earnings per share were significantly lower than 2006 primarily as a result of a lower gross margin reflecting substantially higher input costs principally related to higher costs for dairy products and certain other raw materials and reduced price realization resulting from increased promotional costs partly offset by lower costs associated with our supply chain productivity improvements increased investment spending for advertising and expansion of our international infrastructure also contributed to the lower income in 2007 

nongaap financial measures—items affecting comparability 

our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below 1 the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure 3 an explanation of why our management believes these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors and 4 additional purposes for which we use these nongaap measures 

we believe that the disclosure of these nongaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our yeartoyear operating results we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes “ebit” net income and income per sharedilutedcommon stock “eps” when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 

items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2007 2006 2005 2003 and 2002 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves

summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our income statement 

 

 net sales 

2007 compared with 2006 

net sales for 2007 were essentially even with 2006 sales increased for our international businesses primarily exports to asia and latin america as well as sales in canada and mexico the acquisition of godrej hershey foods and beverages company increased net sales by 465 million or 09 in 2007 favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales these increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the us reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slowmoving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the us 

2006 compared with 2005 

us confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase sales in 2006 also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the united states implemented in 2005 substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in mexico also contributed to the sales increase these increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in canada partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier 

key marketplace metrics 

 

 21 

  

consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution include food drug mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc and convenience stores the change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food drug convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade excluding sales of walmart stores inc 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2007 compared with 2006 

business realignment charges of 1231 million were included in cost of sales in 2007 compared with a credit of 32 million included in cost of sales in 2006 the remainder of the cost of sales increase was primarily associated with significantly higher input costs particularly for dairy products and certain other raw materials and the godrej hershey foods and beverages business acquired in may 2007 offset somewhat by favorable supply chain productivity 

the gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in 2007 compared with 2006 resulting in a reduction of 26 percentage points the rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs 

2006 compared with 2005 

the sales volume increase higher energy raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for 2006 higher costs associated with obsolete aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase these increases were offset somewhat by reductions in us manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of 32 million in 2006 resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives business realignment charges of 225 million were included in cost of sales in 2005 reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in las piedras puerto rico 

gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix these were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin 01 percentage point in 2006 and reduced gross margin by 04 percentage points in 2005 

selling marketing and administrative 

2007 compared with 2006 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses project implementation costs related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives contributed 126 million to the increase higher administrative costs were principally associated with employeerelated expenses from the expansion of our international businesses including the impact of the acquisition of godrej hershey foods and beverages company 

2006 compared with 2005 

selling marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our 2005 business realignment initiatives reduced advertising expense in 2006 was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses 

  

business realignment initiatives 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive threeyear supply chain transformation program the “global supply chain transformation program” and in december 2007 we recorded impairment and business realignment charges associated with our business in brazil together “the 2007 business realignment initiatives” 

when completed the global supply chain transformation program will greatly enhance our manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities reduce inventories resulting in improvements in working capital and generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives these initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core us business creation of innovative new product platforms to meet customer needs and disciplined global expansion under the program which will be implemented in stages over three years we will significantly increase manufacturing capacity utilization by reducing the number of production lines by more than onethird outsource production of low valueadded items and construct a flexible costeffective production facility in monterrey mexico to meet current and emerging marketplace needs the program will result in a total net reduction of 1500 positions across our supply chain over the threeyear implementation period 

the estimated pretax cost of the global supply chain transformation program is from 525 million to 575 million over three years the total includes from 475 million to 525 million in business realignment costs and approximately 50 million in project implementation costs the costs will be incurred primarily in 2007 and 2008 total costs of 4000 million were recorded in 2007 for this program 

in 2001 we acquired a small business in brazil hershey do brasil which has not gained profitable scale or adequate market distribution in an effort to improve the performance of this business in january 2008 hershey do brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with pandurata alimentos ltda “bauducco” a leading manufacturer of baked goods in brazil whose primary brand is bauducco the arrangement with bauducco will leverage bauducco’s strong sales and distribution capabilities for our products throughout brazil under this agreement we will manufacture and market and they will sell and distribute our products we will maintain a 51 controlling interest in hershey do brasil in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and approved a business realignment program associated with initiatives to improve distribution and enhance the financial performance of our business in brazil 

in july 2005 we announced initiatives intended to advance our valueenhancing strategy the “2005 business realignment initiatives” charges credits for the 2005 business realignment initiatives were recorded during 2005 and 2006 and the 2005 business realignment initiatives were completed by december 31 2006 

  

charges credits associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

 the charge of 1231 million recorded in cost of sales for the global supply chain transformation program related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and costs related to inventory reductions the 126 million recorded in selling marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project management and administration in determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds certain real estate with a carrying value or fair value less cost to sell if lower of 402 million was being held for sale as of december 31 2007 employee separation costs included 790 million primarily for involuntary terminations at six north american manufacturing facilities which are being closed the facilities are located in naugatuck connecticut reading pennsylvania oakdale california smiths falls ontario montreal quebec and dartmouth nova scotia the employee separation costs also included 1096 million for charges relating to pension and other postretirement benefits settlements curtailments and special termination benefits 

during the fourth quarter of 2007 we completed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting primarily from lower expected profitability we determined that the carrying amount of our whollyowned subsidiary hershey do 

  

brasil exceeded its fair value and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 123 million in december 2007 there was no tax benefit associated with this charge we discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in note 1 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2007 we also recorded a business realignment charge of 3 million associated with our business in brazil this charge was principally associated with employee separation costs remaining charges of approximately 50 million for this business realignment program are expected to be recorded in 2008 

the charges credits recorded in cost of sales relating to the 2005 business realignment initiatives included a credit of 16 million in 2006 resulting from higher than expected proceeds from the sale of equipment from the las piedras plant and a charge of 225 million in 2005 resulting from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the las piedras plant the charge recorded in selling marketing and administrative expenses in 2006 resulted from accelerated depreciation relating to the termination of an office building lease the net business realignment charges included 73 million and 83 million for involuntary terminations in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the charges credits recorded in 2006 relating to previous business realignment initiatives which began in 2003 and 2001 resulted from the finalization of the sale of certain properties adjustments to liabilities which had previously been recorded and the impact of the settlement as to several of the eight former employees who had filed a complaint alleging that the company had discriminated against them on the basis of age in connection with the 2003 business realignment initiatives a settlement was reached with the remaining former employees in september 2007 

the liability balance as of december 31 2007 relating to the 2007 business realignment initiatives was 684 million for employee separation costs to be paid primarily in 2008 and 2009 as of december 31 2007 the liability balance relating to the 2005 business realignment initiatives was 33 million during 2007 we made payments against the liabilities recorded for the 2007 business realignment initiatives of 132 million principally related to employee separation and project administration we made payments during 2007 against the liabilities recorded for the 2005 business realignment initiatives of 162 million related to the voluntary workforce reduction during 2006 we made total payments of 280 million against the liabilities recorded for the 2005 business realignment initiatives primarily associated with the voluntary workforce reduction 

income before interest and income taxes and ebit margin 

2007 compared with 2006 

ebit decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 principally as a result of higher net business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2007 net pretax business realignment and impairment charges of 4126 million were recorded in 2007 compared with 116 million recorded in 2006 an increase of 4009 million the remainder of the decrease in ebit was attributable to lower gross profit resulting primarily from higher input costs and higher selling marketing and administrative expenses 

ebit margin declined from 201 in 2006 to 93 in 2007 net business realignment and impairment charges reduced ebit margin by 83 percentage points in 2007 net business realignment charges reduced ebit margin by 02 percentage points in 2006 the remainder of the decrease primarily resulted from the lower gross margin in addition to higher selling marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales 

2006 compared with 2005 

ebit increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of lower net business realignment and impairment charges associated primarily with the 2005 business realignment initiatives net pretax business realignment charges of 116 million were recorded in 2006 compared with 1190 million recorded in 2005 a decrease of 1074 million the remainder of the increase in ebit was attributable to lower selling marketing and administrative expenses which were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from higher input costs and the impact of product obsolescence 

  

ebit margin increased from 177 in 2005 to 201 in 2006 net business realignment and impairment charges reduced ebit margin by 02 percentage points in 2006 and 25 percentage points in 2005 the remainder of the improvement in ebit margin reflected lower selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 

interest expense net 

2007 compared with 2006 

net interest expense was higher in 2007 than in 2006 primarily reflecting increased borrowings partially offset by lower interest rates 

2006 compared with 2005 

net interest expense was higher in 2006 than in 2005 primarily reflecting higher interest expense resulting from commercial paper borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock and working capital requirements along with significant contributions to our pension plans in late 2005 higher interest rates in 2006 also contributed to the increase in interest expense 

income taxes and effective tax rate 

2007 compared with 2006 

our effective income tax rate was 371 for 2007 and 362 for 2006 the impact of tax rates associated with business realignment and impairment charges increased the effective income tax rate for 2007 by 11 percentage points 

2006 compared with 2005 

our effective income tax rate was 362 for 2006 and 2005 

net income and net income per share 

2007 compared with 2006 

net income in 2007 was reduced by 2677 million or 115 per sharediluted and in 2006 was reduced by 76 million or 03 per sharediluted as a result of net business realignment and impairment charges excluding the impact of these charges earnings per sharediluted in 2007 decreased by 29 as compared with 2006 as a result of lower ebit offset somewhat by reduced interest expense and the impact of lower weightedaverage shares outstanding in 2007 

2006 compared with 2005 

net income in 2006 was reduced by 76 million or 03 per sharediluted and in 2005 was reduced by 740 million or 30 per sharediluted as a result of net charges associated with our 2005 business realignment initiatives which were recorded in each year in addition to the impact of the business realignment initiatives earnings per sharediluted in 2006 increased primarily as a result of lower selling marketing and administrative expenses which more than offset the impact of reduced gross profit the impact of lower weightedaverage shares outstanding net of higher interest expense also contributed to the increase in earnings per sharediluted in 2006 

  

financial condition 

our financial condition remained strong during 2007 solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies

a summary of our liabilities is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 capital structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have one vote per share holders of the class b stock have ten votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board of directors with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the “milton hershey school trust” or the “trust” maintains voting control over the hershey company historically the milton hershey school trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management however in october 2007 the chairman of the board of the milton hershey school trust issued a statement indicating that the trust continues to be guided by two key principles first that in its role as controlling stockholder of the company it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and second that the longterm prosperity of the company requires the board of directors of the company and its management to build on its strong us position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth he further stated that the milton hershey school trust had communicated to the company’s board that the trust was not satisfied with the company’s results and that as a result the trust was “actively engaged in an ongoing process the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous company board focus on resolving the company’s current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies” in that release the trust board chairman reiterated the trust’s longstanding position that the company board and not the trust board “is solely responsible and accountable for the company’s management and performance” 

  

on november 11 2007 we announced that all of the members of our board of directors had resigned except for richard h lenny who was at that time our chairman of the board and chief executive officer david j west who was at that time president of the company and currently serves as our president and chief executive officer and robert f cavanaugh who is also a member of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers governing body of milton hershey school in addition we announced that the milton hershey school trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the bylaws of the company to allow the company’s stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our board of directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors expanded the size of our board of directors from 11 directors to 13 directors and appointed eight new directors including two who are also members of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers of milton hershey school 

the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

in december 2000 our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement “rights agreement” the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement this action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company under the rights agreement our board of directors declared a dividend of one right “right” for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 26 2000 the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect will not affect reported earnings per share is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded we discuss the rights agreement in more detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper

 offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2007 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 

 

 in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations 

we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations total obligations for each year presented above consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2007 

  

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2007 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

lease arrangement with special purpose trust 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 “interpretation no 46” interpretation no 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of specialpurpose entities “spes” such as specialpurpose trusts “spts” to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests we adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of offbalance sheet arrangements with spts as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements 

in december 2000 we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of a warehouse and distribution facility in redlands california the lease term was approximately ten years with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility the lease agreement contained an option for us to purchase the facility in january 2002 we assigned our right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to us under a new lease agreement the term of this lease agreement was five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 401 million we exercised our option to purchase the facility at the original cost of 401 million and refinanced the related obligation at the end of the lease term in january 2007 

asset retirement obligations 

our company has a number of facilities that contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations within these facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos 

as of december 31 2007 certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which has not been reflected in our current estimates 

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we adjust the reserves from time to time based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 35 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 

  

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts to manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we enter into commodities futures contracts for varying periods these futures contracts are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 

we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended “sfas no 133” sfas no 133 provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2007 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts as cash flow hedges additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2007 note 1 note 5 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2007 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 

 we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2007 

  

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 

in december 2005 we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to 500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006 in february 2006 we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of 250 million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we recorded a gain of 10 million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge in august 2006 a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of 250 million of 10year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of 37 million the 37 million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the 250 million of 545 notes due september 1 2016 

in october 2003 we entered into swap agreements effectively converting interest payments on longterm debt from fixed to variable rates we converted interest payments on 200 million of 67 notes due in october 2005 and 150 million of 695 notes due in march 2007 from their respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor in march 2004 we terminated these agreements resulting in cash receipts totaling 52 million with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the longterm debt we amortized this increase over the terms of the respective longterm debt as a reduction to interest expense 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 

foreign exchange forward contracts 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 

 

 38 

  

we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows 

 

 our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa beans cocoa products sugar dairy products peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa beans and cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2007 cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 74¢ and 95¢ per pound based on the new york board of trade futures contract our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts that reflect varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans cocoa liquor cocoa butter and cocoa powder 

during 2007 dairy prices were significantly higher starting the year at nearly 13¢ per pound and rising to 22¢ per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis tight global supplies were driven by drought in australia as well as reduced exports from the european union due to the elimination of subsidies also input costs for us producers were up due to heightened grain prices impacting feed costs additionally the united states department of agriculture adjusted their mechanism for establishing market prices of nonfat dry milk further escalating costs 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of our raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa beans and cocoa products sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements however the dairy markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and therefore it is not possible to hedge our costs by taking forward positions to extend coverage for longer periods of time we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

  

we account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 133 we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the new york board of trade or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 

 the decrease in fair values from 2006 to 2007 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions which more than offset the impact of higher prices in 2007 the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forwardlooking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions for a discussion of our significant accounting policies refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers mclane company inc accounted for approximately 259 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2007 as of december 31 2007 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total accounts receivable we believe we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base

 pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january 1 2007 we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on our plans we also sponsor two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws for years beginning after 2007 we will need to comply with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans to

 we adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 as of december 31 2006 

pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 net periodic pension benefit costs 

we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2007 primarily due to the modifications announced in october 2006 which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan the higher actual return on pension assets during 2006 and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december 31 2006 pension income is expected to increase somewhat in 2008 due to the impact of the 2007 business realignment initiatives and the retirement or departure of certain executives 

actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gainslosses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial gain component of net periodic pension benefit income for 2008 is 2 million the 2007 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit income was 11 million projections beyond 2008 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit income costs 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2007 and 2006 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve in 2005 we considered the yields of high quality securities in determining the average discount rate assumptions high quality securities are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency the duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

  

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost 

 

  

 average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit income cost as described above we increased our 2007 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 

 

  

 asset return assumptions 

we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit income costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 20 years prior to december 31 2007 was approximately 98 the actual return on assets was as follows 

 

 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost 

 

  

 our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2007 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes as of december 31 2007 the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the lehman aggregate bond index and direct exposure to highly volatile risky sectors such as subprime mortgages was minimal 

  

for 2007 and 2006 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 158 million in 2007 and 236 million in 2006 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our nonqualified pension plans these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2007 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans for 2008 there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the nondomestic plans will not be material 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 

 

  

 other postretirement benefit obligation assumptions were as follows 

 

  

  

 goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  this standard classifies intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair 

  

value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

our other intangible assets consist primarily of customerrelated intangible assets patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we amortize customerrelated intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore we do not amortize them we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimated fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows 

the company performs annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting from lower expected profitability we determined that the carrying amount of our whollyowned subsidiary hershey do brasil exceeded its fair value and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 123 million in december 2007 there was no tax benefit associated with this charge we discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in note 1 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2006 and 2005 based on our annual impairment evaluation 

commodities futures contracts 

we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations accounting for commodities futures contracts is in accordance with sfas no 133 additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows 

 

  

  

 47 

  

 the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 50 million after tax as of december 31 2007 this amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

return measures 

we believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders’ equity and operating return on average invested capital these operating return measures calculated in accordance with gaap are presented on the sixyear consolidated financial summary on page 18 with the directly comparable nongaap operating return measures the nongaap operating return measures are calculated using nongaap income excluding items affecting comparability a reconciliation of net income presented in accordance with gaap to nongaap income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20 along with the reasons why we believe that the use of nongaap income in these calculations provides useful information to investors 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders’ equity to calculate nongaap operating return on average stockholders’ equity we define nongaap income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items these items include the following 

 

  

  

  

 our operating return on average stockholders’ equity gaap basis was 336 in 2007 our nongaap operating return on average stockholders’ equity was 755 in 2007 the decrease in operating return on average stockholders’ equity in 2007 was principally due to lower income over the last six years our nongaap operating return on stockholders’ equity has ranged from 328 in 2002 to 755 in 2007 

operating return on average invested capital 

operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of longterm debt deferred income taxes and stockholders’ equity 

for the calculation of operating return on average invested capital gaap basis earnings is defined as net income adjusted to add back the aftertax effect of interest on longterm debt for the calculation of the nongaap operating return measure we define earnings as net income adjusted to add back the aftertax effect of interest on longterm debt excluding the following 

 

  

 48 

  

  

 our operating return on average invested capital gaap basis was 124 in 2007 our nongaap operating return on average invested capital was 250 in 2007 over the last six years our nongaap operating return on average invested capital has ranged from 189 in 2002 and 2003 to 268 in 2005 and 2006 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors beginning on page 9 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

the year ended december 31 2007 was very difficult we experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities particularly costs for dairy products these cost increases totaled approximately 100 million and reduced gross margin by approximately 240 basis points we also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and tradeup product segments that affected our growth and profitability in the face of these challenges we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core us market additionally we continued to invest in key international markets 

we expect this environment to continue into 2008 with continued increases in input costs versus 2007 of approximately 100 million reducing gross margin by 200 basis points in 2008 we will also incur higher costs for increased investment in brand support and selling capabilities in the us while we are taking steps to enhance product innovation across our portfolio we will also be continuing to invest in key international markets particularly china and india 

to offset higher input costs we are implementing aggressive productivity and cost savings initiatives in addition to those already underway as part of our global supply chain transformation program we are also pursuing opportunities to improve price realization including list price increases effective in january 2008 however these pricing actions will only partly offset input cost increases and expenses associated with investment spending plans resulting in lower ebit and eps excluding items affecting comparability 

we expect consolidated net sales to grow 3 to 4 in 2008 our primary goal is to stabilize business performance in the united states we will continue to emphasize our iconic brands particularly reese’s hershey’s and kisses we will also introduce hershey’s bliss ™ signatures packaged candy and starbucks ® branded chocolates to more fully participate in the rapidly growing premium and tradeup segments of the chocolate category we will also have the fullyear benefit of increased levels of retail coverage and increased investment in brand support for the remainder of the americas we expect increases in net sales and profitability from canada and mexico offset somewhat in brazil as we restructure our business 

global growth is a key component of our future we plan continued focus on growth in asia particularly china and india we expect godrej hershey foods and beverages company to have a positive impact on net sales for 2008 as we geographically expand the sugar confectionery business and introduce milk mix products we anticipate net sales increases in china as the product line we introduced in 2007 gains distribution and consumer trial we also anticipate the opening of hershey’s shanghai chocolate world prior to the 2008 olympics to gain additional exposure for our brands 

for 2008 we expect total pretax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program and restructuring our business in brazil to be in the range of 140 to 160 million we expect costs of approximately 85 million to be included in cost of sales primarily for accelerated depreciation 

  

and approximately 20 million to be included in selling marketing and administrative expenses for start up costs and program management the remainder of these costs will be included in business realignment and impairment charges total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in 2008 are expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by 037 to 042 

as a result of higher input costs and increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising along with investment in our international businesses we expect ebit to decrease in 2008 excluding the impact of business realignment and impairment charges we expect ebit margin to decline due to investments in advertising selling capabilities and building infrastructure for our international businesses 

business realignment and impairment charges associated with our global supply chain transformation program and the restructuring of our business in brazil will reduce net income and earnings per share in 2008 excluding the impact of these business realignment initiatives net income is expected to decline reflecting the increased investments in our businesses as a result nongaap earnings per sharediluted excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be within the 185 to 190 range for 2008 

a reconciliation of gaap and nongaap items to the company’s earnings per sharediluted outlook is as follows 

 

 we believe that the disclosure of nongaap expected epsdiluted excluding items affecting comparability provides investors with a better comparison of expected yeartoyear operating results a reconciliation of certain historical results presented in accordance with gaap to nongaap financial measures excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20 along with the reasons why we believe the use of nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors 

we anticipate cash flows from operating activities in 2008 to be strong but below 2007 levels as a result of reduced working capital improvements compared with 2007 and increased cash required for our global supply chain transformation program we expect working capital to improve in 2008 primarily driven by inventory reductions in the second half of the year but not at the levels experienced in 2007 net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments for 2008 we expect total capital additions to be in the range of 300 to 325 million with 150 to 170 million associated with our global supply chain transformation program 

subsequent event 

in january 2008 we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line effective immediately the price increase applied to our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines and represented a weighted average increase of approximately thirteen percent on these items these products represent approximately onethird of our us confectionery portfolio the price changes approximated a three percent price increase over our entire domestic product line we implemented this action to help partially offset increases in input costs including raw materials fuel utilities and transportation 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 applies under other accounting 

  

pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for our company beginning january 1 2008 as it applies to the accounting for financial assets and liabilities as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements we do not expect any significant changes to our financial accounting and reporting as a result of this new accounting standard 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas no 159 is effective for our company beginning january 1 2008 for financial assets and liabilities as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements we do not expect any significant changes to our financial accounting and reporting as a result of this new accounting standard 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas no 141r” the objective of sfas no 141r is to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer 

 

  

  

 sfas no 141r is effective for our company for business combinations occurring subsequent to december 31 2008 we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this accounting standard 

in december 2007 the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51 “sfas no 160” the objective of sfas no 160 is to improve the relevance comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas no 160 is effective for our company as of january 1 2009 we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements

price changes 

we change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities and transportation and employee benefits 

we announced a combination of price increases and weight changes on certain jolly rancher and twizzlers candy and chocolate packaged candy items in november 2005 these changes went into effect in december 2005 and early 2006 and represented a weightedaverage price increase of approximately one percent over the entire domestic product line when fully effective in the second quarter of 2006 we did not implement any other significant increases to the list prices of our domestic product line during 2006 

in december 2004 we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of approximately half of our domestic confectionery line changes that were effective in january 2005 represented a weightedaverage increase of approximately six percent on our standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines changes that were effective in february 2005 represented a weightedaverage price increase of approximately four percent on packaged candy the price increases announced in december 2004 represented an average increase of three percent over the entire domestic product line 

  

raw materials 

cocoa is the most significant raw material we use to produce our chocolate products we buy a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products such as cocoa butter cocoa liquor and cocoa powder to meet manufacturing requirements cocoa beans are grown principally in far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s crop of cocoa beans cocoa beans are not uniform and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in many growing areas 

civil unrest in the world’s largest cocoaproducing country the ivory coast has resulted in volatile prices however we believe a significant disruption of cocoa supplies from the ivory coast is unlikely in the event such disruption would occur we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer historically there have been instances of weather catastrophes crop disease civil disruptions embargoes and other problems in cocoaproducing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports 

during 2006 cocoa prices traded in a range between 67¢ and 75¢ per pound based on the new york board of trade futures contract the table below shows annual average cocoa prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the new york board of trade 

 

 source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans as a result the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products 

the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 which is a sixyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities the price of sugar one of our most important commodities is subject to price supports under this farm legislation this legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar as a result sugar prices paid by united states users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market 

in 2006 sugar crops and sugar refiners recovered from the hurricane impact of 2005 as a result refined sugar prices declined from 38¢ to 31¢ per pound our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 

united states peanut prices began the year around 37¢ per pound but gradually increased during the year to 42¢ per pound almond prices began the year at 340 per pound and declined to 250 per pound during 2006 milk prices moderated slightly from the high price levels of 2005 we believe that our raw materials supply is adequate to meet our manufacturing requirements 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover our future requirements 

  

generally for periods from 3 to 24 months we enter into futures contracts to manage price risks for cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products currently active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements for more information on price risks associated with our major raw material requirements see commodities—price risk management and futures contracts on page 34

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological conditions risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “projected” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

annual savings from initiatives to advance our valueenhancing strategy may be less than we expect 

in february 2007 we announced a comprehensive supply chain transformation program which includes a phased threeyear plan to enhance our manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities we expect ongoing annual savings from this program and previous initiatives to generate significant savings to invest in our growth initiatives and to advance our valueenhancing strategy if ongoing annual savings do not meet our expectations we may not obtain the anticipated future benefits 

increases in raw material and energy costs could affect future financial results 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa sugar milk peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil 

commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 although we use forward contracts and commodity futures contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs if we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability 

we may be able to pass some or all raw material energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products however higher product prices or decreased product size may also result in a reduction in sales volume if we are not able to increase our selling prices sufficiently to offset increased raw material energy or other input costs including packaging direct labor overhead and employee benefits or if our sales volume decreases significantly there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

implementation of our supply chain transformation program may not occur within the anticipated timeframe andor may exceed our cost estimates 

we announced a supply chain transformation program in february 2007 which is expected to be completed by december 2009 we estimate that this program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs of 525 million to 575 million over the threeyear period completion of this program is subject to multiple operating and executional risks including coordination of manufacturing changes production line startups crossborder legal regulatory and political issues and foreign currency exchange risks among others if we are not able to complete the program initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

pension costs could increase at a higher than anticipated rate 

changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans this could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements of our pension plans additionally we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of our retired employees decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts the fair value of our pension plan assets exceeded pension benefits obligations as of december 31 2006 however a significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increases in our stock price could increase expenses 

changes in the price of our common stock expose us to market risks expenses for incentive compensation could increase due to an increase in the price of our common stock 

market demand for new and existing products could decline 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers continued success is dependent on product innovation including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products effective retail execution appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs and the ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations in addition success depends on our response to consumer trends consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics 

  

our largest customer mclane company inc accounted for more than 25 of total net sales in 2006 reflecting the continuing consolidation of our customer base in this environment there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively mclane company inc is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc 

increased marketplace competition could hurt our business 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive as is the broader snack market in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment 

changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment this could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws among others it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

international operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business 

in 2006 we derived approximately 109 of our net sales from customers located outside the united states in addition portions of our total assets are located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

we concluded a difficult year in 2006 following a strong first half we experienced a slowdown in retail performance resulting from a shift from limited edition line extensions to more sustainable new product platforms which took longer than expected in addition our base business sales were negatively impacted in the second half of the year by poor merchandising activity results for 2006 excluding items affecting comparability as indicated below fell short of our longterm goals and were below expectations 

net sales were impacted by slower retail takeaway and a decline in market share during the second half of the year primarily in our north american chocolate business income per sharediluted was impacted by the lower than expected sales growth increased costs for product obsolescence associated with the shift to new product platforms and increased expenses for advertising and consumer programs during the fourth quarter to regain marketplace momentum a product recall and temporary plant closure in canada also negatively impacted our results for the year we plan to accelerate growth in 2007 by focusing on increasing sales of our core confectionery products revitalizing our iconic brands through increased advertising and increased consumer and customer support and by expanding our innovative new product platforms based on consumer preferences 

adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 108 

securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements “sab no 108” required companies to change the accounting principle used for evaluating the effect of possible prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements as a result we changed one of the five criteria of our revenue recognition policy to delay the recognition of revenue on goods intransit until they are received by our customers we also made adjustments to correct certain liabilities as of december 31 2006 along with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings for all years presented in this report adjustments were made to liabilities primarily associated with business acquisitions and divestitures occurring prior to 2002 as permitted by sab no 108 we adjusted our financial statements for all prior periods to provide comparability these adjustments were not material to our results of operations or financial condition in any period presented in this report 

  

nongaap financial measures—items affecting comparability 

our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below 1 the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure 3 an explanation of why our management believes these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors and 4 additional purposes for which we use these nongaap measures 

we believe that the disclosure of these nongaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our yeartoyear operating results we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes “ebit” net income and income per sharediluted when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 

items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2006 2005 2003 2002 and 2001 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the business realignment initiatives and note 11 contains information about the income tax provision adjustment 

  

  

  

   

 

 summary of operating results 

analysis of selected items from our income statement 

 

 net sales 

2006 compared with 2005 

us confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase sales in 2006 also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the united states implemented in 2005 substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in mexico also contributed to the sales increase these increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in canada partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier 

2005 compared with 2004 

business acquisitions primarily mauna loa macadamia nut corporation “mauna loa” and grupo lorena contributed approximately 29 of the increase in net sales from 2004 approximately twothirds of the additional sales increase of 62 resulted from unit volume growth primarily reflecting the introduction of new 

  

products and limited edition items improved performance by our canadian and mexican businesses and exports to asia and latin america also contributed to this increase the remaining sales increase resulted from selling price increases a lower rate of promotional spending and favorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international businesses 

key marketplace metrics 

 

 consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80 of our us confectionery retail business these channels of distribution include food drug mass merchandisers including walmart stores inc and convenience stores the change in market share is provided for measured channels which include sales in the food drug convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade excluding sales of walmart stores inc 

cost of sales and gross margin 

2006 compared with 2005 

the sales volume increase higher energy raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for 2006 higher costs associated with obsolete aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase these increases were offset somewhat by reductions in us manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of 32 million in 2006 resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives business realignment charges of 225 million were included in cost of sales in 2005 reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in las piedras puerto rico 

gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix these were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin 01 percentage point in 2006 and reduced gross margin by 04 percentage points in 2005 

2005 compared with 2004 

business realignment charges increased cost of sales by 225 million higher sales volume business acquisitions and higher raw material costs in addition to higher labor overhead and distribution costs primarily caused the remainder of the increase 

a less favorable product mix primarily associated with the lowermargin mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses and the impact of business realignment charges reduced our gross margin by 11 percentage points improved price realization primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for our international businesses more than offset the impact of higher raw material labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which had lower margins 

selling marketing and administrative 

2006 compared with 2005 

selling marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our 2005 business realignment initiatives reduced advertising expense in 2006 was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses 

  

2005 compared with 2004 

selling marketing and administrative expenses increased during this period primarily due to increased performancebased employee compensation costs including stockbased compensation business acquisition expenses and consumer promotions expenses also increased but were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses 

business realignment initiatives 

in july 2005 we announced initiatives intended to advance our valueenhancing strategy the “2005 business realignment initiatives” we also announced that we would record a total pretax charge of approximately 140 million to 150 million or 41 to 44 per sharediluted in connection with the 2005 business realignment initiatives our 2005 business realignment initiatives were complete as of december 31 2006 

charges credits associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

 the credit of 16 million recorded in cost of sales during 2006 for the 2005 business realignment initiatives related to higher than expected proceeds from the sale of equipment from the las piedras puerto rico plant the charge recorded in selling marketing and administrative expenses resulted from accelerated depreciation relating to the termination of an office building lease the net business realignment and asset impairments charges recorded during 2006 included 73 million for involuntary terminations relating to organizational changes 

during 2006 we recorded charges credits related to previous business realignment initiatives that began in 2003 and 2001 these charges credits were recorded to finalize the sale of certain properties adjust previously recorded liabilities and reflect the impact of an employment complaint arising from the 2003 business realignment initiatives during 2004 eight former employees filed a complaint in federal court in colorado alleging we discriminated against them based on age we do not expect any significant impact as a result of this case 

the 225 million recorded in cost of sales in 2005 resulted from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the las piedras manufacturing facility the business realignment and asset impairments charge in 2005 included 83 million for involuntary termination benefits primarily for las piedras plant employees 

  

changes in liabilities recorded for the business realignment initiatives were as follows 

 

 income before interest and income taxes and ebit margin 

2006 compared with 2005 

ebit increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of lower net business realignment charges associated primarily with the 2005 business realignment initiatives net pretax business realignment charges of 116 million were recorded in 2006 compared with 1190 million recorded in 2005 a decrease of 1074 million the remainder of the increase in ebit was attributable to lower selling marketing and administrative expenses which were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from higher input costs and the impact of product obsolescence 

net business realignment charges reduced ebit margin by 02 percentage points in 2006 and 25 percentage points in 2005 the remainder of the improvement in ebit margin reflected lower selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 

2005 compared with 2004 

ebit decreased from 2004 to 2005 as a result of net charges of 1190 million related to the 2005 business realignment initiatives recorded in 2005 the impact of the business realignment charges was substantially offset by an increase in ebit of 960 million resulting from the sales volume growth and net price realization which more than offset higher input costs and an increase in selling marketing and administrative expenses 

ebit margin declined in 2005 primarily due to our mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses which had lower margins and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced ebit margin by 31 percentage points also contributing to the ebit margin decline were higher raw material labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products that had lower margins improved price realization improved profitability from our international businesses and lower selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales offset 10 percentage point of the ebit margin decline 

interest expense net 

2006 compared with 2005 

net interest expense was higher in 2006 than the comparable period of 2005 primarily reflecting higher interest expense resulting from commercial paper borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock and working capital requirements along with significant contributions to our pension plans in late 2005 higher interest rates in 2006 also contributed to the increase in interest expense 

2005 compared with 2004 

net interest expense was higher in 2005 primarily due to higher shortterm interest expense and decreased capitalized interest the increase in interest expense was primarily associated with commercial paper borrowings to finance stock repurchases and contributions to our pension plans in addition to higher interest rates 

  

income taxes and effective tax rate 

2006 compared with 2005 

our effective income tax rate was 362 for 2006 and 2005 

2005 compared with 2004 

the effective income tax rate for 2005 benefited by 02 percentage points from the impact of tax rates associated with business realignment charges our effective income tax rate for 2004 was not comparable to 2005 because in 2004 we settled federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years and resolved several state tax audit issues our provision for income taxes was reduced by 611 million from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves related to those years the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses interest on potential assessments and acquisition and divestiture matters the reduction in the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves reduced the effective income tax rate by 73 percentage points 

net income and net income per share 

2006 compared with 2005 

net income in 2006 was reduced by 76 million or 03 per sharediluted and in 2005 was reduced by 740 million or 30 per sharediluted as a result of net charges associated with our 2005 business realignment initiatives which were recorded in each year in addition to the impact of the business realignment initiatives earnings per sharediluted in 2006 increased primarily as a result of lower selling marketing and administrative expenses which more than offset the impact of reduced gross profit the impact of lower weightedaverage shares outstanding net of higher interest expense also contributed to the increase in earnings per sharediluted in 2006 

2005 compared with 2004 

net income for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by total charges associated with the 2005 business realignment initiatives of 1190 million before tax 740 million after tax or 30 per sharediluted net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by 611 million or 24 per sharediluted because of the adjustment to the federal and state income tax contingency reserves 

financial condition 

our financial condition remained strong during 2006 solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies

a summary of our liabilities is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 capital structure 

we have two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors holders of the common stock have one vote per share holders of the class b stock have ten votes per share holders of the common stock voting separately as a class are entitled to elect onesixth of our board of directors with respect to dividend rights holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

hershey trust company as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the “milton hershey school trust” maintains voting control over the hershey company however the milton hershey school trust has not taken an active role in setting our policy nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with 

  

investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

in december 2000 our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement “rights agreement” the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement this action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company under the rights agreement our board of directors declared a dividend of one right “right” for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 26 2000 the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect will not affect reported earnings per share is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded we discuss the rights agreement in more detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows our net income and consequently our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume seasonal sales patterns timing of new product introductions profit margins and price changes sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally working capital needs peak during the summer months we meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper

 offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

as of december 31 2006 our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows 

 

 in entering into contractual obligations we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 

purchase obligations 

we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations total obligations for each year presented above consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31 2006 

the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december 31 2006 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

lease arrangement with special purpose trust 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 “interpretation no 46” interpretation no 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of specialpurpose entities “spes” such as specialpurpose trusts “spts” to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests we adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of offbalance sheet arrangements with spts as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in december 2000 we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of a warehouse and distribution facility in redlands california the lease term was approximately ten years with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility the lease agreement contained an option for us to purchase the facility in january 2002 we assigned our right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to us under a new lease agreement the term of this lease agreement was five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 401 million we exercised our option to purchase the facility at the original cost of 401 million at the end of the lease term in january 2007 

asset retirement obligations 

our company has a number of facilities that contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations within these facilities our asbestos management program is compliant with current regulations current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos 

income tax obligations 

we base our deferred income taxes accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax we maintain reserves for such assessments we determine the reserves based upon our judgment of assessment risk we adjust the reserves from time to time based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 

a settlement of federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of 2004 based upon the results of the audits we reduced our income tax contingency reserves by 737 million this reflected a reduction of the provision for income taxes by 611 million and a reduction to goodwill of 126 million the reserve adjustment related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses interest on potential assessments and acquisition and divestiture matters assessments of additional tax require cash payments we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

we use certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts to manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we enter into commodities futures contracts for varying periods these futures contracts are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features in entering into these contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 

  

accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 

we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended “sfas no 133 as amended” sfas no 133 as amended provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness if any must be recognized currently in earnings 

fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet for fair value hedges we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 

as of december 31 2006 we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments including foreign exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts as cash flow hedges 

we adopted sfas no 133 as amended as of january 1 2001 additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2006 note 1 note 5 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2006 we determined the fair value of longterm debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 

 we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december 31 2006 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 

in december 2005 we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to 500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006 in february 2006 we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of 250 million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we recorded a gain of 10 million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge in august 2006 a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of 250 million of 

  

10year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of 37 million the 37 million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the 250 million of 545 notes due september 1 2016 

in october 2003 we entered into swap agreements effectively converting interest payments on longterm debt from fixed to variable rates we converted interest payments on 200 million of 67 notes due in october 2005 and 150 million of 695 notes due in march 2007 from their respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor in march 2004 we terminated these agreements resulting in cash receipts totaling 52 million with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the longterm debt we are amortizing or have amortized this increase over the remaining terms of the respective longterm debt as a reduction to interest expense 

the fair value of interest rate swaps equals the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period we calculate the fair value of the swap agreements quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments as of december 31 2006 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with interest rate swaps is as follows 

 

 foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment raw materials and finished goods we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and options and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows 

 

 we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 

  

a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts and options is as follows 

 

 our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodities—price risk management and futures contracts 

our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa sugar milk peanuts and almonds the cost of cocoa beans and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2006 cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 67¢ and 75¢ per pound based on the new york board of trade futures contract our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts that reflect varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans 

we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of our raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

we account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 133 as amended we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the new york board of trade or various other exchanges these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

sensitivity analysis 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities inventories priced 

  

forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations we define a loss for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 

 the increase in fair values from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflected an increase in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 

sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forwardlooking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in various instances gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions for a discussion of our significant accounting policies refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers mclane company inc accounted for approximately 229 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2006 as of december 31 2006 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total accounts receivable we believe we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 

accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following 

 

  

  

 we monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 

information on our accounts receivable—trade related expenses and assumptions is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 

liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs 

we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition

 pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

overview 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees these are cash balance 

  

plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on our plans we also sponsor two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws for years beginning after 2007 we will need to comply with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 we fund nondomestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans we broadly diversify our pension plan assets consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations consider payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements we take into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance we take into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more singleemployer defined benefit plans to

 pension plans 

our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 net periodic pension benefit costs 

we expect net periodic pension benefit income in 2007 primarily due to the better than expected asset return in 2006 the modifications announced in october 2006 which will reduce future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december 31 2006 the recognized net actuarial losses will be lower in 2007 primarily due to the better than expected asset return in 2006 actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans’ obligations 

we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gainslosses in excess of 10 of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit costs for 2007 is 24 million this amount was based on the december 31 2006 unrecognized net actuarial loss of 1751 million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years we present the unrecognized net actuarial loss in note 12 pension and other postretirement benefit plans the thirteen to fifteen year amortization period equals the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans “average remaining service period” changes to the assumed rates of participant termination disability and retirement would affect the average remaining service period an increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period 

  

and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect however we anticipate no changes to the assumed rates at this time the 2006 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit costs was 121 million projections beyond 2007 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

average discount rate assumption—net periodic benefit costs 

the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations in order to estimate this rate for 2006 a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation’s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve in 2005 and 2004 we considered the yields of high quality securities in determining the average discount rate assumptions high quality securities are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency the duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 

 

  

 average discount rate assumption—benefit obligations 

the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above we increased our 2006 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment 

the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations 

 

  

 asset return assumptions 

we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 19 years prior to december 31 2006 was approximately 99 the actual return on assets was as follows 

 

 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost 

 

  

   

our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2006 actual allocations were within the specified ranges we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes 

for 2006 and 2005 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however we made contributions of 236 million in 2006 and 2775 million in 2005 to improve the funded status these contributions were fully tax deductible a onepercentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2006 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans for 2007 there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the nondomestic plans will not be material 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows 

 

 the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other postretirement benefit cost 

 

  

 other postretirement benefit obligation assumptions were as follows 

 

  

  

   

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  this standard classifies intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 

we use a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record in the second step we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 

the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans we also consider assumptions that market participants may use such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 

our other intangible assets consist primarily of customerrelated intangible assets patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions we amortize customerrelated intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore we do not amortize them we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimated fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows 

we completed our annual impairment tests and determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired as of december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

commodities futures contracts 

we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations accounting for commodities futures contracts is in accordance with sfas no 133 as amended additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows 

 

   

  

  

 the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and commodities futures contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 46 million after tax as of december 31 2006 this amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts

we believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders’ equity and operating return on average invested capital these operating return measures calculated in accordance with gaap are presented on the sixyear consolidated financial summary on page 15 with the directly comparable nongaap operating return measures the nongaap operating return measures are calculated using nongaap income excluding items affecting comparability a reconciliation of net income presented in accordance with gaap to nongaap income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 17 and 18 along with the reasons why we believe that the use of nongaap income in these calculations provides useful information to investors 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders’ equity to calculate nongaap operating return on average stockholders’ equity we define nongaap income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items these items include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our operating return on average stockholders’ equity gaap basis was 658 in 2006 our nongaap operating return on average stockholders’ equity was 667 in 2006 the increase in operating return on average stockholders’ equity in 2006 was principally due to a reduction in equity resulting from share repurchases and the adoption of sfas no 158 over the last six years our nongaap operating return on stockholders’ equity has ranged from 321 in 2001 to 667 in 2006 

operating return on average invested capital 

operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of longterm debt deferred income taxes and stockholders’ equity 

  

for the calculation of operating return on average invested capital gaap basis earnings is defined as net income less the aftertax effect of interest on longterm debt for the calculation of the nongaap operating return measure we define earnings as net income adjusted to exclude the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operating return on average invested capital gaap basis was 264 in 2006 our nongaap operating return on average invested capital was 268 in 2006 over the last six years our nongaap operating return on average invested capital has ranged from 181 in 2001 to 268 in 2006 and 2005 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors on page 8 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 

during the three years ended december 31 2006 we have improved operating results as we implemented our business strategies over the longterm our strategies seek to achieve the following goals excluding items affecting comparability 

 

  

  

  

 our focus in 2007 includes enhancing the relevance of our products extending our reach and enabling our growth key priorities include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 we expect sales growth in 2007 to be within our longterm goal of 3 to 4 our top priority is restoring and accelerating core brand growth with renewed emphasis on our iconic brands particularly kisses hershey’s and reese’s investment in these brands will double in 2007 with enhanced advertising increased consumer support and powerful instore merchandising 

emphasis during 2007 will also be focused on ontrend growth platforms that leverage our iconic brands our confectionery and nut expertise and our marketplace scale the primary growth platforms that we will focus on in 2007 are 

 

   

  

  

 growth in the dark and premium chocolate platform will be driven by the cacao reserve by hershey’s product line introduced in 2006 sales growth for hershey’s extra dark and special dark products and expansion of sales of scharffen berger and joseph schmidt dark and premium chocolates 

increases in sales of refreshment products are expected from ice breakers gum and mint items driven by the introduction of new gum and mint sours products york chocolatecovered chewy mints introduced in late 2006 will also contribute to sales increases in 2007 

increased sales for our health and wellness product platform will be generated by sixty calorie and one hundred calorie portion control products that leverage our scale brands along with incremental sales of the dagoba organic chocolates business acquired in late 2006 growth will also be contributed from the introduction of ice breakers mint and gum products that contain vitamin c ginseng and antioxidants 

growth in the substantial snack platform is anticipated from sales of new layered sandwich cookies singleserve soft cookies and brownies primarily under the hershey’s and reese’s brand names sales increases are also expected from our really nuts product line in 2007 

over time we will focus on disciplined global expansion in selected high potential markets with a regionally relevant product portfolio geographically we expect future net sales growth to be concentrated primarily in emerging markets in asia particularly india and china mexico and selected markets in south america we intend to focus on growth from our largescale brands expand our sales to global customers and develop regionspecific business systems and alliances 

we expect a return to gross margin expansion in 2007 excluding items affecting comparability we expect higher input costs in 2007 compared with 2006 although to a lesser extent than the cost increases in 2006 compared with 2005 the amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs that we have not fully hedged we utilize forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintain a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies we expect to offset these cost increases through a combination of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 ebit is expected to grow 3 to 4 in 2007 excluding items affecting comparability net sales growth and gross margin expansion will be substantially offset by increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising along with investment in our international businesses 

ebit margin is expected to be flat in 2007 excluding items affecting comparability ebit margin is affected by the following factors 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 improvement in gross margin resulting from a more profitable sales mix and continued enhancement of supply chain productivity is expected to be offset by increased brand investment and the impact of our expanded international operations selling marketing and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of sales during 2007 this is expected to result from increased advertising and consumer marketing expenses and improvements in retail coverage and technology along with the restoration of certain administrative expenses that were unusually low during 2006 because of our business realignment initiatives and lower than expected performance 

net income and eps in 2006 were unfavorably impacted by the 2005 business realignment initiatives excluding the impact of business realignment initiatives net income is expected to increase 3 to 4 and eps is expected to increase within a range of 7 to 9 for the full year 2007 reflecting the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases 

we expect strong cash flows from operating activities in 2007 net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments we will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate the plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2006 we do not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in 2007 we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2007 under the 250 million share repurchase program approved in december 2006 

subsequent events 

in january 2007 our company and lotte confectionery co ltd korea’s leading confectionery and ice cream manufacturer announced a manufacturing joint venture in china that will produce hershey and lotte products for the market in china the manufacturing agreement is part of a strategic alliance that enables the companies to explore opportunities for marketing and distribution of products in asia and the united states the manufacturing facility located in jinshan near shanghai will make a variety of hershey’s  hershey’s kisses and reese’s products and is expected to be in operation by june 2007 with products available in retail locations in china by august 2007 as part of the agreement we will provide lotte with expertise and distribution capabilities in the united states and will help test and distribute lotte’s xylitol gum and a variety of other refreshment products 

in february 2007 our board of directors approved a comprehensive threeyear supply chain transformation program we expect to complete this program by december 31 2009 when completed this program will greatly enhance our manufacturing sourcing and customer service capabilities and will generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives these initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core us business creation of innovative new product platforms to meet consumer and customer needs and disciplined global expansion 

under the program which we will implement in stages over the next three years we will 

 

  

  

   

the result of our transformation program will be a flexible global supply chain capable of delivering our iconic brands in a wide range of affordable items and assortments across retail channels in our priority markets we will source finished products from fewer facilities each one a center of excellence specializing in our proprietary product technologies increased access to borderless sourcing will further leverage our manufacturing scale within a lower overall cost structure 

we have developed a phased threeyear plan to ensure smooth implementation and to maintain product quality and customer service the program will result in a total net reduction of approximately 1500 positions across our supply chain over the next three years when completed manufacturing of approximately 80 percent of our production volume will take place in the us and canada 

we estimate that the program will incur pretax charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs of 525 million to 575 million over the next three years this estimate includes 275 million to 300 million in asset writeoffs 200 million to 225 million in employmentrelated costs including the impact of curtailment charges associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and approximately 50 million in project implementation costs we will incur these charges primarily in 2007 and 2008 with approximately 300 million expected to be charged in 2007 we estimate the cash portion of the total charge to be 275 million to 300 million 

this initiative also includes gross capital investments of 300 million to 310 million capital investments over the implementation period are expected to be approximately 200 million more than previous expectations of 190 million to 200 million per year resulting in total capital expenditures of 250 million to 300 million in 2007 and 225 million to 250 million in 2008 and 2009 following completion of this initiative we expect annual capital investments of approximately 140 million to 160 million 

as a result of the program we estimate that our gross margin should improve significantly with ongoing annual savings of approximately 170 million to 190 million generated by 2010 we will invest a portion of these savings in our strategic growth initiatives in such areas as core brand growth new product innovation selling and gotomarket capabilities and disciplined global expansion the amount and timing of this investment will be contingent upon market conditions and the pace of our innovation and global expansion

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the hershey company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2006 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 95

the hershey company 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting that the hershey company and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states these standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by coso also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by coso

the company manufactures imports markets sells and distributes chocolate products in brazil under the hershey’s brand name including ioio hazelnut crème items in japan korea the philippines and china the company imports andor markets selected confectionery and grocery products the company also markets confectionery and grocery products in over 60 countries worldwide

the company recognizes that the distribution of its products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers the company attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution to achieve these objectives the company has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants including distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico the company primarily uses contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers in conjunction with sales and marketing efforts the distribution system has been instrumental in the growth of sales 

from time to time the company has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value in november 2005 the company announced a combination of price increases and weight changes on certain jolly rancher and twizzler candy and chocolate packaged candy items effective in december 2005 and early 2006 these changes represent a weighted average price increase of approximately 1 over the entire domestic product line when fully effective in the second quarter of 2006 in december 2004 the company announced an increase in the wholesale prices of approximately half of its domestic confectionery line a weighted average increase of approximately 6 percent on the company’s standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines was effective in january 2005 and a weighted average price increase of approximately 4 percent on packaged candy was effective in february 2005 the price increases announced in december 2004 represented an average increase of 3 percent over the entire domestic product line the price increases and weight changes will help to offset increases in the company’s input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits 

the most significant raw material used in the production of the company’s chocolate products is cocoa the company buys a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products such as cocoa butter cocoa liquor and cocoa powder to meet its manufacturing requirements this commodity is imported principally from far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s crop of cocoa beans cocoa beans are not uniform and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas while civil unrest in the ivory coast the world’s largest cocoaproducing country has resulted in volatile prices the company believes a significant disruption of cocoa supplies from the ivory coast is unlikely in the event such disruption does occur the company believes cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer historically there have been instances of weather catastrophes crop disease civil disruptions embargoes and other problems in cocoa producing countries that have caused price fluctuations but have never resulted in total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop andor exports 

the table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the new york board of trade because of the company’s forward purchasing practices discussed below and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the company’s average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products 

 during 2005 cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 64¢ and 79¢ per pound based on the new york board of trade futures contract the company’s costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans 

the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 which is a sixyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

the price of sugar one of the company’s most important commodities for its products is subject to price supports under the abovereferenced farm legislation due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar established by that legislation sugar prices paid by united states users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market in 2005 hurricanes damaged sugar cane crops and two cane refineries in louisiana causing the wholesale list price of refined sugar to increase from 30¢ to 42¢ per pound the company’s costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of its forward purchasing and hedging practices united states peanut prices began the year around 40¢ per pound but gradually declined during the year to 36¢ per pound almond prices began the year at 300 per pound and rose to 400 per pound during the second half of 2005 during the first three quarters of 2005 milk prices moderated only slightly from the high price levels of 2004 milk production in 2005 increased more than 3 compared with 2004 and prices began to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months with regard to cocoa sugar 

corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts at the present time active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the company’s other major raw material requirements futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweetener natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the company’s transportation costs the company’s commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and to provide visibility to future costs but may also potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

the primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products cash outflows and inflows result from original margins that are “good faith deposits” established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations additionally variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements the magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets cash flows related to margin requirements historically have not been material to the company’s total working capital requirements 

the company manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities these procurement strategies are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the company’s business since the cost of raw materials energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales procurement strategies with regard to cocoa sugar and other major raw material requirements energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals including weather and crop analysis imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries speculative influences and by discussions with market analysts brokers and dealers procurement strategies are determined implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the company’s board of directors the “board” on a regular basis 

competition 

many of the company’s brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace however these brands are sold in highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational national regional and local firms some of which have resources in excess of those available to the company 

trademarks 

the company owns various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to the company’s business 

backlog of orders 

the company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales nor are the changes from time to time significant 

research and development 

the company engages in a variety of research activities these principally involve development of new products improvement in the quality of existing products improvement and modernization of production processes and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning the company’s

  risk factors tableend the nature of our operations and the environment in which we operate subject us to changing economic competitive regulatory and technological conditions risks and uncertainties in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we note the following factors that among others could cause future results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein many of the forwardlooking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of forwardlooking words such as “intend” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “should” “planned” “estimated” and “potential” among others among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such forwardlooking statements are the risk factors described below 

our ability to implement and generate expected ongoing annual savings from initiatives to advance our value enhancing strategy 

in july 2005 we announced initiatives intended to advance our valueenhancing strategy these initiatives include a us voluntary workforce reduction program “vwrp” facility rationalization and the streamlining and restructuring of our international operations including a canadian vwrp we project that these initiatives will be fully implemented by december 31 2006 these initiatives are expected to generate ongoing annual savings of approximately 45 million to 50 million when fully implemented the savings will be reinvested in activities that will further the growth of our business improve cash flows and enhance shareholder returns should ongoing annual savings fall short of expectations we may not reap the anticipated benefits of our valueenhancing strategy 

changes in raw material and other costs and selling price increases 

we use many different commodities for our business including cocoa sugar milk peanuts almonds corn sweeteners natural gas and fuel oil commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations the quality and availability of supply weather currency fluctuations speculative influences trade agreements among producing and consuming nations political unrest in producing countries consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs although we use forward contracts and commodity futures contracts to hedge commodity prices commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs we may be able to pass some or all of the raw material and energy cost increases to customers in the form of higher product prices however higher product prices may also result in a reduction in sales volume if we are not able to increase price realization and productivity to offset increased raw material costs or if sales volume is significantly reduced it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to implement improvements to and reduce costs associated with the supply chain 

further optimization of our supply chain is also essential to offset the potential for raw material and other cost increases discussed above we have made significant improvements to the supply chain consolidating our distribution network exiting underperforming businesses and rationalizing the product line continued productivity initiatives such as these will be necessary to offset future cost increases and to enable potential expansion into adjacencies to our current product portfolio 

pension cost factors 

changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans additionally employee decisions to withdraw lump sums could result in pension 

settlement losses depending on the magnitude of such withdrawals although the fair value of our pension plan assets exceeded pension benefits obligations as of december 31 2005 a significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stock price 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in the price of our common stock expenses for incentive compensation stock options and certain employee benefits could increase due to an increase in the price of our common stock 

market demand for new and existing products 

we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products to generate revenues and profits we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers continued success is dependent on product innovation including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products effective sales incentives appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs and the ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail in addition success depends on our response to consumer trends consumer health concerns including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics 

our largest customer mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers accounted for more than 20 of total net sales in 2005 reflecting the continuing consolidation of our customer base in this environment there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers including retailers and distributors to compete effectively 

marketplace competition 

the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive as is the broader snack market in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and continue to introduce and establish new products due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits in addition we may incur increased credit and other business risks as a result of competing for customers in a highly competitive retail environment 

governmental laws and regulations 

changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter the environment in which we operate and therefore affect our results of operations or increase liabilities these include changes in food and drug laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and environmental laws it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition 

international operations 

in 2005 we derived approximately 11 of our net sales from customers located outside the united states in addition portions of our total assets are located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including

  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the company concluded a strong year in 2005 operating results were consistent with management’s strategies to profitably grow net sales and carefully control selling marketing and administrative costs resulting in balanced consistent growth in earnings excluding certain items affecting comparability discussed below gross margin was lower in 2005 primarily due to business realignment charges further discussed in note 4 and the fullyear impact of the acquired grupo lorena and mauna loa businesses 

the company gained market share in key classes of trade introduced new product platforms that provide future growth opportunities and offset continued increases in the cost of major raw materials energy employee benefits and compensation excluding certain items affecting comparability the result was record sales profits and earnings per share for the year 

the company’s longterm goals include increasing net sales 3–4 per year increasing earnings before interest and income taxes “ebit” 7–9 per year and increasing earnings per share “eps” 9–11 per year these goals are intended to achieve balanced sustainable growth over time after excluding items affecting comparability the company exceeded all of these goals in 2005 

the company’s strategy to profitably grow net sales is based upon the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items utilizing its key brands such as hershey’s  reese’s and hershey’s kisses together with focused promotion and merchandising activities of new and existing products during 2005 sales gains included recent product introductions such as hershey’s kisses filled with peanut butter hershey’s kissables brand chocolate candies hershey’s cookies reese’s big cup peanut butter cups ice breakers sour mints and hershey’s take5 candy bar along with continued growth in all major trade channels 

the trends of key marketplace metrics such as retail takeaway and market share continue to show positive results during 2005 the company achieved gains in retail takeaway and market share and strengthened its position in the us confectionery market in channels of distribution including sales in the food drug and mass merchandiser classes of trade excluding sales to walmart stores inc us consumer takeaway in 2005 increased by 35 resulting in a market share gain of 09 points 

net sales increased approximately 92 in 2005 compared with 2004 net sales which were approximately 62 above 2003 the increase in 2005 and over the threeyear period primarily resulted from higher unit sales volume due to the introduction of new products and limited edition items along with the impact of price increases business acquisitions improved exchange rates on international sales and improved trade promotion efficiency resulting in lower promotional spending as a percentage of sales 

gross margin decreased from 395 in 2004 to 387 in 2005 the margin decline resulted primarily from a less favorable product mix primarily associated with the lowermargin mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced gross 

margin by a total of 11 percentage points improved price realization primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for the company’s international businesses more than offset the impact of higher raw material labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins 

the company’s strategy to expand ebit margin is based upon obtaining price realization by achieving a larger part of its sales growth in its most highly profitable products and channels improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its trade promotion programs improving efficiencies in its supply chain and tight control of selling marketing and administrative costs the company has also implemented selected price increases and product weight reductions to help offset increases in raw material and other costs 

ebit margin decreased from 199 in 2004 to 178 in 2005 the ebit margin decline resulted primarily from a lower gross margin resulting from the lowermargin mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses and the impact of business realignment charges which reduced ebit margin by a total of 31 percentage points this decrease was partially offset by an improvement in ebit margin of 10 percentage points resulting from improved price realization improved profitability for the company’s international businesses and lower selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales which more than offset the impact of higher raw material labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins 

net income was 4932 million in 2005 compared with 5779 million in 2004 net income per sharediluted of 199 for 2005 was down 116 from 225 per share for 2004 net income and net income per sharediluted for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by the business realignment initiatives discussed below net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by a 611 million adjustment to federal and state income tax contingency reserves as discussed below 

net income was 5779 million in 2004 compared with 4419 million in 2003 net income per sharediluted of 225 for 2004 was up 347 from 167 per share for 2003 this gain resulted from increased income from operations the nonrecurring adjustment to the 2004 provision for income taxes the impact of lower weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes recorded in 2003 associated with a change in accounting for the company’s leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” sfas no 123r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its valuable equity instruments for employee services it also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services for public entities the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments including employee stock options would be measured based on the grantdate fair value of those instruments that cost would be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period often the vesting period generally no compensation cost would be recognized for equity instruments that do not vest the company adopted sfas no 123r in the fourth quarter of 2005 and applied the modified retrospective application method to all prior years for which statement of financial accounting standards no 123 was effective accordingly the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods were adjusted to give effect to the fairvaluebased method of accounting for awards granted modified or settled in cash subsequent to december 31 1994 additional stockbased compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r reduced net income by 217 million 130 million and 156 million or 09 05 and 06 per sharediluted in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the additional expense for 2005 included 24 million after tax or 01 per sharediluted in business realignment charges 

the table below presents various items affecting the comparability of income over the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 all income and income per share amounts reflect the impact of the 

adoption of sfas no 123r items affecting comparability include the impact of business realignment initiatives in 2005 and 2003 a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves and a gain on the sale of business in 2003 the company believes the presentation of income excluding such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations which are indicative of its ongoing operations the company excludes such items in evaluating key measures of performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on its business the company believes that this presentation provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of the business financial results including the impact of the reduction to the provision for income taxes business realignment initiatives and the gain on the sale of business over the threeyear period may be insufficient in facilitating a complete understanding of the business as a whole and ascertaining the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance 

the business realignment initiatives are described below and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and the reduction to the provision for income taxes as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves is described below and in note 12 

 income per sharediluted excluding items affecting comparability increased 134 in 2005 and 162 in 2004 reflecting the impact of the company’s increased sales control of selling marketing and administrative costs and share repurchases during the periods this performance also drove increases in operating return on average invested capital during the period as discussed under the heading return measures on page 36 

during 2006 the company expects sales growth to be somewhat above its longterm 3–4 goal 

the company anticipates higher input costs in 2006 particularly for commodities transportation and employee benefits the company expects to offset these cost increases through improved price realization procurement strategies continued improvements in supply chain efficiency and tight control of selling marketing and administrative costs ebit is expected to increase slightly above the longterm goal of 7–9 in 2006 excluding items affecting comparability and ebit margin is expected to increase approximately 90 basis points 

the company expects to achieve 2006 growth in earnings per sharediluted slightly greater than its longterm goal of 9–11 excluding items affecting comparability this growth will result from the sales and ebit margin increases discussed above combined with the realized annual savings from business realignment initiatives continued control of selling marketing and administrative costs and the impact of lower shares outstanding resulting from continued share repurchases 

the company’s cash flow from operations is expected to increase in 2006 primarily as a result of reduced contributions to the company’s pension plans and lower working capital requirements 

primary challenges in 2006 and beyond include profitable sales growth within the us core confectionery category the broader us snack market and in selected international markets focus will continue to be placed on higher margin and faster growth channels as well as on key global customers in selected regions of the world the achievement of the company’s objectives for sales growth and profitability will also be challenged by changes in the business and competitive environment which will continue to be characterized by increased global competition and customer consolidation along with social issues such as obesity concerns in 2006 the company will continue to be faced with achieving increased price realization and improved productivity in order to offset higher input costs for ingredients transportation and employee benefits successfully meeting these challenges is critical to the company’s achievement of its financial objectives 

results of operations 

net sales 

net sales for 2005 increased 4067 million or 92 from 2004 business acquisitions contributed approximately 29 of the increase from 2004 approximately twothirds of the additional sales increase of 63 resulted from unit volume growth primarily reflecting the introduction of new products and limited edition items and improved performance by the company’s international businesses particularly the canadian mexican and export businesses in asia and latin america the remainder of the sales increase resulted from selling price increases a lower rate of promotional spending and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for the company’s international businesses 

net sales increased 2567 million or 62 from 2003 to 2004 net sales were favorably impacted by increased sales volume especially within the united states primarily driven by the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items net sales of the company’s canadian mexican and brazilian businesses also improved as a result of higher sales volume favorable foreign currency exchange rates also resulted in increased sales for the company’s international businesses particularly in canada the positive impact of increased sales volume contributed more than 75 of the consolidated net sales growth higher selling prices a more efficient rate of promotional spending and the acquisition of the grupo lorena business in mexico also contributed to the net sales increase sales were unfavorably affected by the divestiture of certain gum brands in september 2003 decreased sales of remaining gum brands and higher returns discounts and allowances relating primarily to the sales volume growth along with lower export sales in asia particularly in china and taiwan 

cost of sales 

cost of sales increased 2851 million or 106 from 2004 to 2005 business realignment charges increased cost of sales by 225 million the remainder of the cost increase was primarily caused by higher sales volume business acquisitions and higher raw material costs in addition to higher labor overhead and distribution costs gross margin decreased from 395 in 2004 to 387 in 2005 the margin decline resulted primarily from a less favorable product mix primarily associated with the lowermargin mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced gross margin by a total of 11 percentage points improved price realization primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for the company’s international businesses more than offset the impact of higher raw material labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins 

cost of sales increased 1357 million or 53 from 2003 to 2004 the cost increase was primarily caused by higher sales volume and higher raw material costs principally associated with increased prices for cocoa and dairy products these cost of sales increases were partially offset by lower costs primarily resulting from product weight reductions and reduced costs for packaging materials 

gross margin increased from 390 in 2003 to 395 in 2004 the margin expansion reflected improved price realization primarily from reduced product weights and reduced promotional 

spending as a percentage of sales as well as efficiency improvements in manufacturing operations the margin improvements were partially offset by increases in raw material costs 

selling marketing and administrative 

selling marketing and administrative expenses for 2005 increased 459 million or 53 from 2004 primarily reflecting increased performancebased employee compensation costs which include stockbased compensation incremental expenses related to business acquisitions and higher consumer promotion expenses these increases were offset somewhat by lower advertising expense selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 196 in 2004 to 189 in 2005 

selling marketing and administrative expenses for 2004 increased by 260 million or 31 from 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs which have been adjusted to reflect stockbased compensation under sfas no 123r increased consumer promotion expenses termination costs associated with the closing of certain warehouse facilities and litigation expenses associated with the introduction of hershey’s smartzone nutrition bars these increases were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses and a reduction in allowances for doubtful accounts as described below selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 202 in 2003 to 196 in 2004 during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company reached an agreement with fleming reclamation creditor’s trust which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy of fleming companies inc one of the company’s customers based on this agreement the company reduced its bad debt reserves by the 50 million which had been added at the time of the bankruptcy announcement in april 2003 

business realignment initiatives 

in july 2005 the company announced initiatives intended to advance its valueenhancing strategy the company also announced that it would record a total pretax charge of approximately 140 million to 150 million or 41 to 44 per sharediluted in connection with these initiatives of the total pretax charge approximately 80 million will be incurred in connection with a us voluntary workforce reduction program “vwrp” approximately 41 million will be incurred in connection with facility rationalization and approximately 24 million will be incurred in connection with streamlining and restructuring the company’s international operations including a canadian vwrp 

during the second half of 2005 the company recorded charges totaling 1190 million associated with the initiatives the charges of 1190 million consisted of a 965 million business realignment charge and 225 million recorded in cost of sales together the “2005 business realignment initiatives” the business realignment charge included 695 million related to the us vwrp 128 million for facility rationalization relating to the closure of the las piedras puerto rico plant and 142 million related to streamlining the company’s international operations primarily associated with costs for the canadian vwrp the charge for facility rationalization included 83 million for involuntary termination benefits primarily for las piedras plant employees the 225 million recorded in cost of sales resulted primarily from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the las piedras manufacturing facility the company believes that the 2005 business realignment initiatives will be fully completed by december 31 2006 

based on current estimates the cost to implement the business realignment program will result in total pretax charges of approximately 140 million to 150 million or 35 to 38 per sharediluted on an aftertax basis total pretax charges of 1190 million or 29 per sharediluted were recorded in the second half of 2005 with the remainder to be substantially recorded in the first half of 2006 

changes in liabilities recorded for the business realignment initiatives were as follows 

 during 2003 the company executed a number of initiatives continuing its valueenhancing strategy these initiatives included realigning the sales organization and streamlining the supply chain by divesting or eliminating certain nonstrategic brands and products and by production line rationalization these actions resulted in a net charge of approximately 172 million or 04 per sharediluted the 172 million net charge consisted of the writeoff of certain inventories of 21 million included in cost of sales a net business realignment and asset impairments charge of 234 million and an 83 million net gain resulting from the divestiture of certain brands together the “2003 business realignment initiatives” 

the net business realignment and asset impairments charge of 234 million consisted of early retirement and involuntary termination costs of 100 million sales office closing and relocation costs of 73 million fixed asset impairment charges of 57 million equipment removal costs of 7 million and a net gain of 3 million relating to the elimination of nonstrategic brands and products in determining the fixed asset impairment losses fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds cash payments during 2004 reduced the liability balance to 39 million as of december 31 2004 cash payments during 2005 reduced the liability balance to 13 million 

arising out of the 2003 business realignment initiatives eight former employees of the company filed a complaint in federal court in colorado alleging the company discriminated against them on the basis of age the trial of these claims is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2006 the company intends to vigorously defend against these claims and based on the developments of the case to date the company does not consider the likelihood of a material unfavorable outcome to the company to be probable 

gain on sale of business 

as part of the company’s business realignment initiatives the sale of a group of gum brands to farley’s  sathers candy company inc “farley’s  sathers” was completed in september 2003 the gum brands included fruit stripe chewing gum rainblo gum balls and super bubble bubble gum in the third quarter of 2003 the company received cash proceeds from the sale of 200 million and recorded a gain of 83 million before tax or 57 million after tax as a result of the transaction 

interest expense net 

net interest expense in 2005 was 215 million higher than 2004 primarily reflecting higher shortterm interest expense and decreased capitalized interest the increase in shortterm interest expense was primarily associated with commercial paper borrowings to finance stock repurchases and contributions to the company’s pension plans in addition to higher interest rates in 2005 net interest expense for 2004 was 30 million higher than in 2003 primarily reflecting higher shortterm interest expense partially offset by increased capitalized interest the increase in shortterm interest expense was associated with commercial paper borrowings during 2004 for repurchases of common stock business acquisitions and other funding requirements 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for 2005 was 362 compared with 291 in 2004 and 366 in 2003 the effective income tax rate for 2005 benefited by 02 percentage points from the impact of tax rates associated with the business realignment charges the effective income tax rate for 2004 is not comparable with the rates for 2005 and 2003 because the company’s provision for income taxes was reduced by the 611 million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of 2004 this noncash reduction of income tax expense resulted from the settlement of federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues based upon the results of the audits the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of 611 million in income tax expense the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses interest on potential assessments and acquisition and divestiture matters the reduction in the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves reduced the effective income tax rate by 73 percentage points 

cumulative effect of accounting change 

an aftertax charge of 74 million or 03 per sharediluted was recorded in 2003 to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the company’s leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities as discussed further under the heading offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

net income 

net income decreased 847 million or 146 and net income per sharediluted decreased 26 from 2004 to 2005 net income for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by total charges associated with business realignment initiatives of 1190 million before tax 740 million after tax or 29 per sharediluted net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by 611 million or 24 per sharediluted as a result of the adjustment to the federal and state income tax contingency reserves 

net income was 5779 million in 2004 compared with 4419 million in 2003 net income per sharediluted of 225 for 2004 increased 58 per share from 167 per share for 2003 as a result of the reduction to the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves increased income from operations and the impact of lower weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year in addition to the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting change recorded in 2003

assets 

total assets increased 4825 million or 127 as of december 31 2005 primarily as a result of higher accounts receivable inventories and other assets 

current assets increased by 2112 million principally reflecting increased accounts receivable resulting from increased sales of new products and seasonal items in december 2005 which qualified for extended payment terms and higher inventories associated with the timing of receipts of raw materials along with increased goods in process inventories to support higher manufacturing requirements in early 2006 

property plant and equipment was lower than the prior year primarily due to depreciation expense of 2001 million including 218 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the 2005 business realignment initiatives as discussed above partially offset by capital additions of 1811 million goodwill increased as a result of the 2005 business acquisitions the increase in other intangibles primarily reflected the estimated value of trademarks and customerrelated intangibles from the business acquisitions the increase in other assets was primarily related to contributions to the company’s pension plans of 2775 million reduced somewhat as a result of pension expense recorded in 2005 

liabilities

incentive compensation the increase in deferred taxes was primarily associated with the impact of pension contributions made during 2005 

capital structure 

the company has two classes of stock outstanding common stock and class b stock holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders including the election of directors with the common stock having one vote per share and the class b stock having ten votes per share however the common stock voting separately as a class is entitled to elect onesixth of the board of directors with respect to dividend rights the common stock is entitled to cash dividends 10 higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 

the milton hershey school trust maintains voting control over the company however the milton hershey school trust has not taken an active role in setting policy for the company nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of the company’s board of directors or management the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the company in june 2002 but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september 2002 after terminating the sale process the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general subsequently pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the company’s outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual cash obligations by year 

 in entering into contractual obligations the company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company’s risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

the company has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations total obligations for each year are comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that have been valued using market prices as of december 31 2005 the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods however the variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the company’s futures price cover for those periods accordingly increases or decreases in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of december 31 2005 and in future periods taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 “interpretation no 46” interpretation no 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of specialpurpose entities “spes” such as specialpurpose trusts “spts” to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests 

the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of three offbalance sheet arrangements with spts as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the company had no offbalance sheet arrangements the consolidation of the spts resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately 74 million or 03 per sharediluted in the third quarter of 2003 reflecting the aftertax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through june 29 2003 additionally the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property plant and equipment of approximately 1077 million with a corresponding increase to longterm debt of 1155 million and to other longterm liabilities of 44 million reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements prior to june 30 2003 expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income subsequent to the 

consolidation of these entities expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding longterm debt the consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase to interest expense of 28 million in 2003 offset by a decrease in rental expense for these facilities included in cost of sales 

during 1999 and 2000 the company entered into offbalance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities in hershey pennsylvania atlanta georgia and redlands california these offbalance sheet arrangements enabled the company to lease these facilities under more favorable terms than other leasing alternatives the lease arrangements were with spts the spts were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the facilities to the company the spts financed the acquisition of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent thirdparty financial institutions the independent thirdparty financial institutions that hold the equity certificates are the owners of the spts the owners of the spts made substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3 which were at risk during the entire term of each lease accordingly the company did not consolidate the spts prior to june 30 2003 because all of the conditions for consolidation had not been met as of december 31 2005 only the lease for the redlands california warehouse and distribution facility remained in effect the properties in pennsylvania and georgia were purchased and the leases terminated in july and october 2005 respectively 

the following is a summary of each of the lease transactions 

in december 2000 the company entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in redlands california the lease term was approximately ten years with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility the lease agreement contained an option for the company to purchase the facility in january 2002 the company assigned its right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the company under a new lease agreement the lease term is five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 401 million 

in october 2000 the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near atlanta georgia the lease term was five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 182 million in october 2005 at the end of the initial lease term the company exercised its option to purchase the facility and refinanced the related obligation of 175 million 

in july 1999 the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the construction and leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the company near hershey pennsylvania under the agreement the lessor paid construction costs totaling 617 million the lease term was six years including the oneyear construction period with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor in july 2005 at the end of the initial lease term the company exercised its option to purchase the facility and refinanced the related obligation of 593 million 

aside from the residual guarantee and instrument guarantee associated with the individual leasing arrangement for the redlands california facility as discussed below the company has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of the spt associated with the redlands facility the company has not collateralized the obligation in connection with the lease the company has no obligations with respect to refinancing of the lessor’s debt would incur no significant penalties which would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the lease and has no significant guarantees other than the residual and instrument guarantees discussed below there are no other material commitments or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangement the company’s transactions with the spt are limited to the lease agreement the company does not anticipate entering into any other arrangements involving spes 

the lease includes a substantial residual guarantee by the company for a significant amount of the financing and an option to purchase the facility at original cost pursuant to instrument guarantees in the event of a default under the lease agreement the company guaranteed to the note holders and certificate holders payment in an amount equal to all sums then due under the lease 

there are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreement if the company decides not to renew the lease the terms for each renewal period under the lease arrangement are identical to the initial terms and do not represent bargain lease terms 

if the company were to exercise its option to purchase the facility at original cost at the end of the initial lease term the company could purchase the facility for a total of approximately 401 million in 2007 if the company chooses not to renew the lease or purchase the assets at the end of the lease term the company is obligated under the residual guarantee for approximately 357 million for the lease additionally the company is obligated to remarket the property on the lessor’s behalf and upon sale distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs if the company chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease term the company does not anticipate a material disruption to operations since such a facility is not unique facilities with similar racking and storage capabilities are available in the area where the facility is located there are no significant leasehold improvements that would be impaired there would be no adverse tax consequences the financing of a replacement facility would not be material to the company’s cash flows and costs related to relocation would not be significant to income 

the company has a number of facilities which contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations current regulations do not require the company to remove or remediate locations containing asbestos in existing facilities however current regulations do require that the company handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished the company does not have plans to renovate or demolish these facilities in the foreseeable future accordingly the company believes it does not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities because the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates cannot be specified and information is not available to apply an expected present value technique the facilities are expected to be maintained by repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos 

the company’s provision for income taxes accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes are based upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of the company and interpretation of tax laws as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax the company maintains reserves for such assessments the reserves are determined based upon the company’s judgment of assessment risk and are adjusted from time to time based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 

a settlement of federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of 2004 based upon the results of the audits the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of income tax reserves by 737 million reflecting a reduction of the provision for income taxes by 611 million and a reduction to goodwill of 126 million the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses interest on potential assessments and acquisition and divestiture matters assessments of additional tax require use of the company’s cash the company is not aware of any significant income tax assessments

by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of 4 million and 44 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in market rates was 1 million and 4 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the company’s risk related to the foreign exchange contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodity price risk management 

the company’s most significant raw material requirements include cocoa sugar milk peanuts and almonds the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months with regard to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts at the present time active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the company’s other major raw material requirements futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweetener natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw material and energy requirements fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the company’s transportation costs the company’s commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and to provide visibility to future costs but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

the cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors including the effect of weather on crop yield other imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences during 2005 cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 64¢ and 79¢ per pound based on the new york board of trade futures contract the company’s costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans 

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts unrealized gains and losses are made on a daily basis the company accounts for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 133 as amended and accordingly cash transfers are reported as a component of other comprehensive income such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs in the future futures being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the company to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent based on the company’s net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year the company’s net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts held over or under the amount required to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities relating to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products inventories priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations a loss is defined for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the 

opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 the decrease in fair values from 2004 to 2005 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures being held at certain points in time during the years 

sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forwardlooking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected the important factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield other imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences in addition to changes in the company’s hedging strategies 

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period significant accounting policies employed by the company including the use of estimates are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates involved in applying the company’s accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have been used for the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would have a material impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations the company’s most critical accounting estimates discussed below pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable—trade accrued liabilities and pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business the company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria the company’s primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company inc one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores drug stores wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers which accounted for approximately 203 of the company’s total accounts receivable as of december 31 2005 as of december 31 2005 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of the company’s total accounts receivable and the company believes that it has little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of its customer base accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements assessments of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions the company monitors the collectibility of its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing the credit worthiness of its 

customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 

over the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 the company recorded expense averaging approximately 12 million per year for potential uncollectible accounts including a 50 million provision in 2003 related to the estimate of probable exposure to the bankruptcy of one of the company’s customers fleming companies inc this provision was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2004 upon the agreement with fleming reclamation creditor’s trust which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy writeoffs of uncollectible accounts net of recoveries averaged approximately 29 million over the same period the provision for uncollectible accounts is recognized as selling marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the past three years the allowance for doubtful accounts has ranged from 1 to 3 of gross accounts receivable if reasonably possible nearterm changes in the most material assumptions were made with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable the amounts by which the annual provision would have changed would have resulted in a reduction in expense of approximately 25 million to an increase in expense of approximately 15 million changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on the company’s liquidity or capital resources 

accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products the company utilizes numerous trade promotion programs the costs of such programs are recognized as a reduction to net sales with the recording of a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of product shipment the accrued liability for marketing promotions is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future as a result of changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products promotional costs were 5848 million 5575 million and 5512 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively reasonably possible nearterm changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs would have resulted in changes ranging from a reduction in such costs of approximately 166 million to an increase in costs of approximately 64 million with an increase or decrease to net sales and income before income taxes within that range over the last three years actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 6 changes in estimates related to the cost of promotion programs would not have a material impact on the company’s liquidity or capital resources 

at the time of sale the company estimates a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends seasonal timing and sales patterns and product movement at retail estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel current economic trends changes in consumer demand the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotion programs over the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2 of gross sales reasonably possible nearterm changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from 5 million to 10 million in each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 actual costs have not deviated from the company’s estimates by more than 1 reasonably possible nearterm changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on the company’s liquidity or capital resources 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans the principal plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees the company is monitoring legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on its plans the company also sponsors two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

the company’s policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws respectively nondomestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations plan assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations are made considering payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements the company takes into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance the company takes into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions the discount rate assumption is reviewed and may be revised annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and would be revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

pension plans 

the net periodic pension benefits cost for the company’s pension plans was 299 million 344 million and 515 million respectively in 2005 2004 and 2003 for 2006 net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be slightly higher than 2005 primarily due to the lower 2005 discount rate partially offset by the impact of cash contributions to the pension plans in 2005 the recognized net actuarial losses will be higher in 2006 due to the lower discount rate actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan’s obligations are revised from time to time the company’s policy is to amortize only unrecognized net actuarial gainslosses in excess of 10 of the respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2006 is 123 million based on the december 31 2005 unrecognized net actuarial loss presented in note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 3141 million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans “average remaining service period” changes to the assumed rates of participant termination disability and retirement would impact the average remaining service period an increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect however changes to these assumed rates are not anticipated at this time the 2005 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost was 106 million projections beyond 2006 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

the company used an average discount rate assumption of 57 60 and 63 for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for its plans the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost a one 

percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by 111 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by 104 million the company’s discount rate represents the estimated rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled in order to estimate this rate the company considers the yields of high quality securities which are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency the duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of the pension plan liabilities 

the company reduced its average discount rate assumption to 54 for valuing obligations as of december 31 2005 from 57 as of december 31 2004 due to the declining interest rate environment a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december 31 2005 pension benefits obligations by 1407 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december 31 2005 pension benefits obligations by 1215 million 

asset return assumptions of 85 were used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2005 2004 and 2003 and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefits cost was based on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets the company considers the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 18 years prior to december 31 2005 was approximately 96 the actual return on assets was 78 during 2005 with gains during 2004 and 2003 of approximately 107 and 211 respectively the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by 107 million and a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by 106 million 

the company’s pension asset investment policies specify ranges of pension asset allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows equity securities 40–85 debt securities 15–60 and cash and certain other investments 0–10 as of december 31 2005 the actual allocations were within the ranges the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns is expected to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes disclosed 

for 2005 and 2004 minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material however the company made contributions of 2775 million in 2005 and 80 million in 2004 to improve the funded status these contributions were fully tax deductible a one percentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2005 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans for 2006 there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the nondomestic plans will not be material 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefits costs relate primarily to health care and life insurance benefits net periodic other postretirement benefits costs for the company sponsored plans were 246 million 243 million and 239 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively for the calculation of net periodic other postretirement benefits costs discount rate assumptions of 57 60 and 63 were used for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic other postretirement benefits costs a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2005 net periodic other postretirement benefits costs by 12 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2005 net periodic other postretirement benefits costs by 13 million 

the company used discount rate assumptions of 54 and 57 to value the other postretirement benefits obligations as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december 31 2005 other postretirement benefits obligations by 404 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december 31 2005 other postretirement benefits obligations by 345 million 

on december 8 2003 the president of the united states signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “2003 medicare act” the 2003 medicare act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare “medicare part d” as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d certain prescription drug benefits offered under the company’s postretirement health care plans qualify for the subsidy under medicare part d the federal subsidy to be provided by the 2003 medicare act reduced net periodic benefits costs beginning in 2004 by approximately 30 million and lowered the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation by approximately 252 million 

other critical accounting policies employed by the company include the following 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets other intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore these assets are not being amortized customerrelated intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately ten years patents are being amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately fifteen years 

the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is performed by using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded in the second step the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 

the evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 

the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

goodwill was assigned to reporting units and annual impairment tests were performed for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarters of 2003 2004 and 2005 no impairment of assets was determined as a result of these tests 

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations commodities futures contracts utilized by the company are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 as amended additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the net aftertax impact of cash flow hedging derivatives on comprehensive income loss reflected a 65 million loss in 2005 a 163 million gain in 2004 and a 202 million loss in 2003 net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures contracts reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to income for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reflected in cost of sales reclassification of gains of 181 million 261 million and 519 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively were associated with commodities futures contracts a beforetax loss of 20 million resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on commodities futures contracts was recognized in cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2005 gains on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately 4 million and 4 million before tax for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively no gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into income as a result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not occur there were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness the amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 36 million after tax as of december 31 2005 which were principally associated with commodities futures contracts 

return measures 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity 

the company’s operating return on average stockholders’ equity on a gaap basis was 457 in 2005 the company’s adjusted operating return on average stockholders’ equity was 526 in 2005 for the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average stockholders’ equity earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of indefinitelived intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004 the aftertax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2005 2003 2002 and 2001 the aftertax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the company in 2002 and the aftertax gains on the sale of a group of the company’s gum brands in 2003 the sale of the luden’s throat drops business in 2001 and the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000 over the most recent sixyear period the adjusted return has ranged from 288 in 2000 to 526 in 2005 

operating return on average invested capital 

the company’s operating return on average invested capital on a gaap basis was 237 in 2005 the company’s adjusted operating return on average invested capital was 270 in 2005 average invested capital consists of the annual average of beginning and ending balances of longterm debt deferred income taxes and stockholders’ equity for the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average invested capital earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of indefinitelived intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 

2004 the aftertax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2005 2003 2002 and 2001 the aftertax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the company in 2002 the aftertax gains on the sale of a group of the company’s gum brands in 2003 the sale of the luden’s throat drops business in 2001 the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000 and the aftertax effect of interest on longterm debt over the most recent sixyear period the adjusted return has ranged from 160 in 2000 to 270 in 2005 

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially refer to risk factors on page 7 for information concerning the key risks to achieving future performance goals 

during the three years ended december 31 2005 the company significantly improved operating results as it implemented its strategies over the longterm these strategies seek to deliver average net sales growth of 3–4 per year 7–9 annual growth in earnings before interest expense and income taxes “ebit” improvement in ebit margin of 90 basis points per year and 9–11 earnings per sharediluted “eps” growth per year 

the company expects sales growth in 2006 from benefitdriven innovation such as the introduction of limited edition items and new products continued expansion within the total us snack market and a disciplined approach to achieving profitable growth in key global markets the company will continue to introduce new items and limited edition line extensions during 2006 these will include a full year of sales for the following items that were introduced in 2005 hershey’s kisses brand filled with peanut butter ice breakers sour mints hershey’s kissables brand chocolate candies and hershey’s caramel bar the company expects yearoveryear net sales growth to build throughout 2006 due to the timing of new product shipments price increases and shifts in seasonal business early in 2005 overall growth for the full year 2006 is expected to be somewhat above the company’s 3–4 longterm goal 

geographically net sales growth is expected to be concentrated primarily in the americas and selected regions in asia the company intends to focus on growth from its largescale brands expand its sales to global customers and develop regionspecific business systems 

the company expects higher input costs in 2006 particularly for commodities transportation and employee benefits the amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs which the company has not fully hedged the company utilizes forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintains a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies the company expects to offset these cost increases through improved price realization enhanced trade promotion efficiency procurement strategies continued improvements in supply chain efficiency and tight control of selling marketing and administrative costs 

ebit is expected to grow slightly above the longterm goal of 7–9 in 2006 excluding items affecting comparability as a result of net sales growth and gross margin expansion combined with savings realized from the company’s business realignment initiatives along with careful control of selling marketing and administrative costs 

ebit margin is expected to improve by approximately 90 basis points in 2006 excluding items affecting comparability margin improvement is affected by various factors including selling prices promotional allowances raw material costs supply chain efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period during 2006 ebit margin expansion is expected from improved price realization resulting from a combination of selling price increases and product weight changes and from increased sales to more profitable channels such as convenience stores mass merchandisers drug stores and specialty stores in addition enhanced effectiveness in trade promotion spending focused on fewer brands with greater reach and reduced selling marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to contribute to margin expansion in 2006 gross margin is expected to increase modestly in 2006 from improved price realization and supply chain efficiencies 

as the company continues to leverage its existing manufacturing capacity and distribution infrastructure a reduction in selling marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is anticipated from leveraging the company’s sales force capabilities without increasing costs and from combining various administrative functions in the company’s north american operations these initiatives are expected to more than offset the impact of higher input costs primarily for raw materials transportation and employee benefits 

net income and eps in 2005 were unfavorably impacted by the 2005 business realignment initiatives recorded in the third and fourth quarters excluding the impact of the 2005 business realignment initiatives net income and eps are expected to increase slightly above the range of the company’s longterm goals for the full year 2006 

the company expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2006 net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments the company will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate the plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2005 the company does not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in 2006 the company plans to repurchase approximately 575 million of its common stock in 2006 to be funded by cash provided from operations and additional borrowings

certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the 2005 presentation in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” sfas no 123r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its valuable equity instruments for employee services it also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services for public entities the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments including employee stock options would be measured based on the grantdate fair value of those instruments that cost would be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period often the vesting period generally no compensation cost would be recognized for equity instruments that do not vest the company adopted sfas no 123r in the fourth quarter of 2005 and applied the modified retrospective application method to all prior years for which statement of financial accounting standards no 123 was effective accordingly consolidated financial statements for all prior periods were adjusted to give effect to the fairvaluebased method of accounting for awards granted modified or settled in cash subsequent to december 31 1994 the impact of sfas no 123r decreased net income by 217 million 130 million and 156 million or 09 05 and 06 per sharediluted in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the impact in 2005 included 24 million after tax or 01 per sharediluted in business realignment charges 

adjustments requiring increases decreases to assets liabilities and stockholders’ equity resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r were as follows 

 the consolidated financial statements include the impact of the company’s business realignment initiatives as described in note 4 cost of sales included pretax charges resulting from the business realignment initiatives of 225 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2003 respectively 

the company’s effective income tax rate was 362 in 2005 291 in 2004 and 366 in 2003 the effective income tax rate for 2005 benefited by 02 percentage points from the impact of tax rates associated with business realignment charges the effective income tax rate for 2004 is not comparable with the effective income tax rates for 2005 and 2003 because the company’s provision 

for income taxes was benefited by a 611 million adjustment recorded in 2004 to income tax contingency reserves the noncash reduction of income tax expense resulted from the settlement of federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues based upon the results of the audits the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of income tax reserves by 737 million reflecting a reduction of the provision for income taxes by 611 million and a reduction to goodwill of 126 million the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses interest on potential assessments and acquisition and divestiture matters 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 “interpretation no 46” interpretation no 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of specialpurpose entities “spes” to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 additional information regarding the adoption of interpretation no 46 is contained in note 2 cumulative effect of accounting change

use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting estimates involved in applying the company’s accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have been used for the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would have a material impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations the company’s most critical accounting estimates pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable—trade accrued liabilities and pension and other postretirement benefit plans

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations 

the company accounts for commodities futures contracts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended “sfas no 133 as amended” sfas no 133 as amended provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument if any must be recognized currently in earnings for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment referred to as a fair value hedge the gain or loss must be recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value all derivative instruments currently utilized by the company including commodities futures contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and 25 to 40 years for buildings and related improvements maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and production lines are capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives 

the company reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

asset retirement obligations 

the company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143  asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that result from the acquisition construction or development and the normal operation of a longlived asset

the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets other intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore these assets are not being amortized customerrelated intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately ten years patents are being amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately fifteen years 

the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is performed by using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded in the second step the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 

the impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 

the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions

5 commitments 

the company has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations total obligations for each year are comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that have been valued using market prices as of december 31 2005 the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods however the variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the company’s futures price cover for those periods accordingly increases or decreases in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of december 31 2005 and in future periods taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities

future minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases with a remaining term in excess of one year as of december 31 2005 totaled 588 million 2006—131 million 2007— 118 million 2008—104 million 2009—71 million 2010—55 million 2011 and beyond—109 million 

6 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the company adopted sfas no 133 as amended as of january 1 2001 sfas no 133 as amended requires the company to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for the change in fair value of the derivative depends on whether the instrument qualifies for and has been designated as a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship there are three types of hedging relationships a cash flow hedge a fair value hedge and a hedge of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation the designation is based upon the exposure being hedged all derivative instruments currently utilized by the company are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 

objectives strategies and accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts to manage variability in cash flows associated with interest rate currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures the interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs if it is probable that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time derivative gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets are immediately reclassified into earnings gains and losses on terminated derivatives designated as hedges are accounted for as part of the originally hedged transaction gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges of items that mature or are sold or terminated are recognized in income in the same period as the originally hedged transaction was anticipated to affect earnings the company utilizes derivative instruments for hedging purposes only and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes in entering into these contracts the company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in december 2005 the company entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated 500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006 the average fixed rate on the forward swap agreements is 51 in october 2003 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest payments on longterm debt from fixed to variable rates interest payments on 2000 million of 67 notes due in october 2005 and 1500 million of 695 notes due in march 2007 were converted from the respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” in march 2004 the company terminated these agreements resulting in cash receipts totaling 52 million with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the longterm debt this increase is being amortized over the remaining term of the respective longterm debt as a reduction to interest expense 

in february 2001 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variableinterestrate payments on certain leases from a variable to a fixed rate payments on leases associated with the financing of construction of a warehouse and distribution facility near hershey pennsylvania for 617 million and the financing of the purchase of a warehouse and distribution facility near atlanta georgia for 182 million were variable based on libor the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the variableinterestrate payments on the leases from libor to a fixed rate of 61 these interest rate swap agreements expired at the end of the respective lease terms during 2005 

as previously discussed in note 2 cumulative effect of accounting change the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of the company’s three offbalance sheet arrangements with spts for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities the consolidation of those entities resulted in the recording of longterm debt of 593 million and 175 million associated with the warehouse and distribution facilities near hershey and atlanta respectively corresponding to the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as of june 30 2003 the company designated a new hedging relationship contemporaneous with the discontinuance of the preexisting hedging relationship due to the consolidation of the two corresponding spts prospectively beginning on june 30 2003 the interest rate differential on the interest rate swap agreements was classified as an adjustment to interest expense 

the variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements qualified as cash flow hedges and the notional amounts interest rates and terms of the swap agreements were consistent with the underlying lease agreements they were intended to hedge and therefore there was no hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses on the interest rate swap agreements were included in other comprehensive income and were recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged interest payments affected earnings the fair value of forward swap agreements was a liability of 49 million as of december 31 2005 the fair value of variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements was a liability of 17 million as of december 31 2004 liabilities associated with swap agreements as of december 31 2005 and 2004 are included on the consolidated balance sheets as accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities respectively with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes 

cash flows from interest rate swap agreements were classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows the company’s risk related to the interest rate swap agreements was limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase or forecasted purchases of equipment certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with its subsidiaries outside the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options are intended to be and are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments or forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies since there is a direct relationship between the foreign currency derivatives and the foreign currency denomination of the transactions foreign currency derivatives are highly effective in hedging cash flows related to transactions denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies these contracts meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and accordingly gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales or selling marketing and administrative expense in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings in entering into these contracts the company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was estimated by obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of 4 million and 44 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively included on the consolidated balance sheets as other current assets with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes cash flows from foreign exchange forward contracts and options designated as hedges of foreign currency price risks associated with the purchase of equipment are classified as net cash flows used by provided from investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

cash flows from other foreign exchange forward contracts and options are classified as net cash provided from operating activities 

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations commodity price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months commodities futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as cash flow hedges accordingly gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized ratably in cost of sales in the same period that the hedged raw material manufacturing requirements are recorded in cost of sales 

in order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk it must be demonstrated that the changes in fair value of the commodities futures contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with commodity purchases for manufacturing requirements and with transportation costs the assessment of hedge effectiveness for commodities futures is performed on a quarterly basis by calculating the change in switch values relative to open commodities futures contracts being held and the number of futures contracts needed to price raw material purchases for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs tracking changes in basis differentials as discussed below also monitors effectiveness the prices of commodities futures contracts reflect delivery to the same locations where the company takes delivery of the physical commodities and therefore there is no ineffectiveness resulting from differences in location between the derivative and the hedged item commodities futures contracts have been deemed to be highly effective in hedging price risks associated with corresponding raw material purchases for manufacturing requirements and transportation costs 

because of the rollover strategy used for commodities futures contracts which is required by futures market conditions some ineffectiveness may result in hedging forecasted manufacturing requirements as futures contracts are switched from nearby contract positions to contract positions which are required to fix the price of raw material purchases for manufacturing requirements hedge ineffectiveness may also result from variability in basis differentials associated with the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing requirements hedge ineffectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis and the ineffective portion of gains or losses on commodities futures is recorded currently in cost of sales in accordance with sfas no 133 as amended 

exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts unrealized gains and losses are made on a daily basis and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs in the future cash flows from commodities futures contracts are classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows futures contracts being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated manufacturing requirements for each commodity physical commodity forward purchase contracts meet the sfas no 133 as amended definition of “normal purchases and sales” and therefore are not considered derivative instruments 

the net aftertax impact of cash flow hedging derivatives on comprehensive income loss reflected a 65 million loss in 2005 a 163 million gain in 2004 and a 202 million loss in 2003 net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures contracts reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to income for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reflected in cost of sales reclassification of gains of 181 million 261 million and 519 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively were associated with commodities futures contracts a beforetax loss of 20 million resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on commodities futures contracts was recognized in cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2005 gains on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of 

sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately 4 million and 4 million before tax for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively no gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into income as a result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not occur there were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as of december 31 2005 the amount of net aftertax losses on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 36 million which was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts

the company’s marketing strategy is based upon its strong brand equities product innovation the consistently superior quality of its products manufacturing expertise and mass distribution capabilities in addition the company devotes considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products the company utilizes a variety of promotional programs for customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers the company employs promotional programs at various times during the year to stimulate sales of certain products the company’s sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year 

the company recognizes that the distribution of its products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers the company attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution to achieve these objectives the company has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico the company uses a combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers in conjunction with sales and marketing efforts the distribution system has been instrumental in the growth of sales 

from time to time the company has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value in december 2004 the company announced an increase in the wholesale prices of approximately half of its domestic confectionery line a weighted average increase of approximately 6 percent on the company’s standard bar kingsize bar 6pack and vending lines was effective in january 2005 and a weighted average price increase of approximately 4 percent on packaged candy was effective in february 2005 the price increases represent an average increase of 3 percent over the entire domestic product line and will help to offset increases in the company’s input costs including raw and packaging materials fuel utilities transportation and employee benefits in january 2003 the company implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size king size variety pack 6pack and 10pack lines the effect of all the increases translated into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire domestic product line 

the most significant raw material used in the production of the company’s chocolate products is cocoa beans this commodity is imported principally from far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s crop cocoa beans are not uniform and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and 

natural conditions found in the many growing areas the company buys a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the new york board of trade because of the company’s forward purchasing practices discussed below and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the company’s average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products 

 after declining from an eighteenyear high in february 2003 cocoa prices continued to trade at relatively high price levels during 2004 continued civil unrest in the world’s largest cocoaproducing country the ivory coast has resulted in volatile market conditions but has not materially affected the harvesting and marketing of the cocoa crop the company’s costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans the company’s costs for cocoa will increase in 2005 however the company expects to achieve its goals for growth and profitability over the foreseeable future by a combination of selling price increases improved sales mix supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment 

the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 which is a sixyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

the price of sugar the company’s second most important commodity for its products is subject to price supports under the abovereferenced farm legislation due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar established by that legislation sugar prices paid by united states users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market the average wholesale list price of refined sugar fob northeast has remained in a range of 25¢ to 32¢ per pound for the past ten years united states peanut prices traded around 40¢ per pound during 2004 almond prices remained firm throughout the year due to strong global demand and a weakening us dollar prices were 200 per pound during the first half of 2004 and rose to 300 per pound during the second half of the year milk prices increased significantly in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of a decline in milk production milk prices in 2005 are expected to moderate from the high prices of 2004 as milk production increases the company believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials and certain energy requirements primarily through forward purchasing to cover future requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months with regard to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts at the present time active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the company’s other major raw material requirements futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweetener natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the company’s transportation costs the company’s commodity procurement practices are intended to 

reduce the risk of future price increases but may also potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

the primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products cash outflows and inflows result from original margins that are “good faith deposits” established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations additionally variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements the magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets cash flows related to margin requirements historically have not been material to the company’s total working capital requirements 

the company manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities these procurement strategies are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the company’s business since the cost of raw materials energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales procurement strategies with regard to cocoa sugar and other major raw material requirements energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals including weather and crop analysis imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries speculative influences and by discussions with market analysts brokers and dealers procurement strategies are determined implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the company’s board of directors the “board” on a regular basis

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the company concluded a strong year in 2004 operating results were consistent with management’s strategies to profitably grow net sales improve gross margin and carefully control selling marketing and administrative costs resulting in balanced consistent growth in earnings the company gained market share in key classes of trade introduced new product platforms that provide future growth opportunities offset substantial increases in the cost of major raw materials primarily cocoa and dairy products and executed a 500 million share purchase from its major shareholder the result was record sales profits and earnings per share for the year 

the company’s longterm goals include increasing net sales 3–4 per year increasing gross margin 70–90 basis points per year increasing earnings before interest and income taxes 7–9 per year and to increase earnings per share 9–11 per year these goals are intended to achieve balanced sustainable growth over time in 2004 the company exceeded all of these goals except gross margin expansion which was up 50 basis points slightly less than the longterm goal 

the company’s strategy to profitably grow net sales is based upon the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items utilizing its key brands such as hershey’s  reese’s and hershey’s kisses during 2004 sales gains included product introductions such as hershey’s kisses filled with caramel swoops candies reese’s white chocolate peanut butter cups ice breakers liquid ice mints  hershey’s 1gram sugar carb bar and hershey’s take5 candy bar 

the trends of key operating drivers such as market share are expected to continue to show positive results during 2004 the company achieved gains in market share each quarter and strengthened its confectionery category leadership position market share in measured channels increased 11 share points in the fourth quarter and 6 share points for the year measured channels include sales in the food drug convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade excluding sales to walmart stores inc 

net sales increased approximately 6 in 2004 compared with 2003 net sales which were approximately 1 above 2002 the increase in 2004 and over the threeyear period primarily resulted from higher unit sales volume due to the introduction of new products and limited edition items along with the impact of price increases improved exchange rates on canadian sales and in 2004 improved trade promotion efficiency resulting in lower promotional spending as a percentage of sales 

the company’s strategy to expand gross margin is based upon obtaining price realization by achieving a larger part of its sales growth in its most highly profitable products and channels improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its trade promotion programs and improving efficiencies in its supply chain the company has also implemented selected price increases and weight decreases to help offset increases in raw material costs particularly for cocoa and dairy products 

gross margin increased to 395 in 2004 compared with 390 in 2003 and 378 in 2002 the improvements in gross margin resulted from price increases selected weight reductions and improved supply chain efficiency over the threeyear period more than offsetting higher raw material costs

income per sharediluted excluding items affecting comparability increased 15 in 2004 and 13 in 2003 reflecting the impact of the company’s increased sales improved gross margin control of selling marketing and administrative costs and share repurchases during the period this performance also drove increases in operating return on average invested capital during the period as discussed under the heading return measures on page 32 

during 2005 the company expects continued sales growth of 6–7 including growth at the top end of its longterm 3–4 goal for the ongoing business enhanced by the first year impact of the mauna loa and grupo lorena acquisitions 

the company expects to continue to improve gross margin in 2005 despite higher input costs particularly for commodities transportation and employee benefits these costs will be more than offset by price increases on its bar and packaged candy lines announced in december 2004 that average approximately 3 over the entire domestic product line and continued improvements in supply chain efficiency gross margin is expected to improve 30–40 basis points in 2005 including growth approaching the lower end of the company’s longterm goal of 70–90 basis points for the ongoing business reduced by the impact of integrating the lower margin grupo lorena and mauna loa businesses 

the company expects to achieve 2005 growth in earnings per sharediluted of 9–11 excluding items affecting comparability in line with its longterm goal this growth will result from the sales and gross margin increases discussed above combined with continued control of selling marketing and administrative costs and the impact of lower shares outstanding resulting from the share repurchases in 2004

primary challenges in 2005 and beyond include profitable sales growth within the core confectionery category and entry into the broader snack market focus will continue to be placed on higher margin and faster growth channels the achievement of the company’s objectives for sales growth and profitability will also be challenged by changes in the business and competitive environment which will continue to be characterized by increased global competition and retailer consolidation along with social issues such as childhood obesity concerns in 2005 the company will continue to be faced with achieving increased price realization and improved productivity in order to offset higher input costs for ingredients transportation and employee benefits successfully meeting these challenges is critical to the company’s achievement of its growth objectives

spending to promotional allowances as discussed above and more efficient agency contracts these cost reductions were offset somewhat by increased compensation and employee benefits costs packaging development and marketing research expenses

in august 2003 the company completed the sale of a group of gum brands to farley’s  sathers for 200 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives and in june 2002 the company completed the sale of certain confectionery brands to farley’s  sathers for 120 million in cash as part of its 2001 business realignment initiatives 

financing activities included debt borrowings and repayments payments of dividends the exercise of stock options incentive plan transactions and the repurchase of common stock during the past three years shortterm borrowings in the form of commercial paper or bank borrowings were used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and finance share repurchase programs including the purchase of common stock from the milton hershey school trust during the past three years a total of 20138634 shares of common stock have been repurchased for 10 billion cash used for incentive plan transactions of 3258 million during the past three years was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options of 2212 million cash used by incentive plan transactions reflected purchases of the company’s common stock in the open market to replace treasury stock issued for stock options exercises the company intends to repurchase shares to replace shares issued for stock options exercises the value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based upon stock options exercises over time and market conditions as of december 31 2004 approximately 19 million shares issued for stock options exercises in 2004 and 2003 remained to be repurchased most of these shares were repurchased in early 2005 

net cash provided from operating activities was 7975 million for 2004 an increase of 2045 million compared with the prior year the primary contributors to the increase were higher net income and increases in cash provided from other assets and liabilities and accounts receivable these 

increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows related to deferred income taxes principally reflecting the deferred tax benefit resulting from the income tax contingency reserve adjustment of 737 million in the second quarter of 2004 and cash used as a result of higher inventories as of december 31 2004 to support higher sales anticipated in early 2005 prior to the effective date of selling price increases 

cash provided from changes in other assets and liabilities was 1328 million in 2004 compared with a use of cash of 814 million in 2003 the change in cash flows reflected reduced cash contributions to the company’s pension plans which were 1122 million lower in 2004 compared with 2003 increased cash provided from commodity transactions primarily reflecting higher commodity futures market prices in 2004 and cash provided from higher liabilities primarily associated with incentive plans in 2004 an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable in 2004 compared with cash used by accounts receivable in 2003 was primarily attributable to improved cash collections 

net cash provided from operating activities was 5929 million for 2003 a decrease of 324 million compared with 2002 the primary contributors to the decrease were reductions in cash provided from deferred income taxes and higher accounts receivable balances at yearend the decrease in cash provided from deferred income taxes principally reflected the tax impact of the lower pension plan contributions in 2003 versus 2002 

the decreases above were partially offset by higher net income and increases in cash provided from other assets and liabilities and accounts payable cash used by other assets and liabilities was 814 million in 2003 compared with 1065 million in 2002 the reduction in the use of cash reflected reduced cash contributions to the company’s pension plans which were 1878 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002 decreased cash provided from commodity transactions primarily reflecting lower commodity futures market prices in 2003 and an increase in cash provided by higher liabilities primarily associated with selling and marketing programs in 2003 the increase in cash provided from accounts payable reflected the timing of payments 

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual cash obligations by year 

 in entering into contractual obligations the company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company’s risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

the company has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from thirdparty brokers and dealers to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations total obligations for each year are comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that have been valued using market prices as of december 31 2004 the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods however the 

variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the company’s futures price cover for those periods accordingly increases or decreases in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of december 31 2004 and in future periods taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2004 such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 “interpretation no 46” interpretation no 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of specialpurpose entities “spes” such as spts to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests 

the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of three offbalance sheet arrangements with spts as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the company had no offbalance sheet arrangements the consolidation of the spts resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately 74 million or 03 per sharediluted in the third quarter of 2003 reflecting the aftertax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through june 29 2003 additionally the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property plant and equipment of approximately 1077 million with a corresponding increase to longterm debt of 1155 million and to other longterm liabilities of 44 million reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements prior to june 30 2003 expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income subsequent to the consolidation of these entities expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding longterm debt the consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase to interest expense of 28 million in 2003 offset by a decrease in rental expense for these facilities included in cost of sales an increase in depreciation expense of 26 million in 2003 also resulted from the consolidation of these entities with a total of 54 million of depreciation expense recorded in 2004 

during 1999 and 2000 the company entered into offbalance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities these offbalance sheet arrangements enabled the company to lease these facilities under more favorable terms than other leasing alternatives the lease arrangements are with spts whereby the company leases warehouse and distribution facilities in redlands california atlanta georgia and hershey pennsylvania as discussed below the spts were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the facilities to the company the spts financed the acquisition of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent thirdparty financial institutions the independent thirdparty financial institutions that hold the equity certificates are the owners of the spts the owners of the spts have made substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3 which will be at risk during the entire term of each lease accordingly the company did not consolidate the spts prior to june 30 2003 because all of the conditions for consolidation had not been met 

in december 2000 the company entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in redlands california the lease term was approximately ten years with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility the lease agreement contained an option for the company to purchase the facility in january 2002 the company assigned its right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the company under a new lease agreement the lease term is five years with up to 

four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 401 million 

in october 2000 the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near atlanta georgia the lease term is five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 182 million 

in july 1999 the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the construction and leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the company near hershey pennsylvania under the agreement the lessor paid construction costs totaling 617 million the lease term is six years including the oneyear construction period with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor 

aside from the residual guarantees and instrument guarantees associated with the individual leasing arrangements as discussed below the company has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of these entities the company has not collateralized the obligations in connection with these leases the company has no obligations with respect to refinancing of the lessor’s debt would incur no significant penalties which would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the leases and has no significant guarantees other than the residual and instrument guarantees discussed below there are no other material commitments or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangements the company’s transactions with the spts are limited to the lease agreements the company does not anticipate entering into any other arrangements involving spes 

the leases include substantial residual guarantees by the company for a significant amount of the financing and options to purchase the facilities at original cost pursuant to instrument guarantees in the event of a default under the lease agreements the company guaranteed to the note holders and certificate holders payment in an amount equal to all sums then due under the leases 

there are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreements if the company decides not to renew any of the three leases the terms for each renewal period under each of the three lease arrangements are identical to the initial terms and do not represent bargain lease terms 

if the company were to exercise its options to purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective initial lease terms the company could purchase the facilities for a total of approximately 1200 million 799 million for the pennsylvania and georgia facilities in 2005 and 401 million for the california facility in 2007 if the company chooses not to renew the leases or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms the company is obligated under the residual guarantees for approximately 1032 million in total for the three leases additionally the company is obligated to remarket each property on the lessor’s behalf and upon sale distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs if the company chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms the company does not anticipate a material disruption to operations since such facilities are not unique facilities with similar racking and storage capabilities are available in each of the areas where the facilities are located there are no significant leasehold improvements that would be impaired there would be no adverse tax consequences the financing of replacement facilities would not be material to the company’s cash flows and costs related to relocation would not be significant to income 

the facility located near hershey pennsylvania was constructed on land owned by the company the company entered into a ground lease with the lessor an spt the initial term of the ground lease extends to the date that is the later of i the date the facility lease is no longer in effect or ii the date when the company satisfies the residual guarantee associated with the lease an additional term for the ground lease begins upon the end of the initial ground lease term and ends upon the later of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the 75th anniversary of the ground lease commencement date if the company chooses not to renew the building lease or purchase the building it must remarket the building on the lessor’s behalf subject to the ground lease which will continue in force until the earlier of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the 75th anniversary of the ground lease inception date the lease of the warehouse and distribution facility does not include any provisions which would require the company to sell the land to the spt 

the company’s provision for income taxes accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes are based upon income statutory tax rates the legal structure of the company and interpretation of tax laws as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in assessments of additional tax the company maintains reserves for such assessments the reserves are determined based upon the company’s judgment of assessment risk and are adjusted from time to time based upon changing facts and circumstances such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 

a settlement of federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of 2004 based upon the results of the audits the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of income tax reserves by 737 million reflecting a reduction of the provision for income taxes by 611 million and a reduction to goodwill of 126 million the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility and timing of certain expenses interest on potential assessments and acquisition and divestiture matters assessments of additional tax require use of the company’s cash the company is not aware of any significant income tax assessments 

accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts to manage interest rate currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts and options are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features in entering into these contracts the company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended “sfas no 133 as amended” sfas no 133 as amended provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument if any must be recognized currently in earnings for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment referred to as a fair value hedge the gain or loss must be recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value all derivative instruments currently utilized by the company including variable to fixed interest rate swaps foreign exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges the company adopted sfas no 133 as amended as of january 1 2001 additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the information below summarizes the company’s market risks associated with longterm debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2004 this information should be read in conjunction with note 1 note 6 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

longterm debt 

the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for longterm debt including the current portion as of december 31 2004 the fair value of longterm debt was determined based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 

 interest rates on variable rate obligations were calculated using the rate in effect as of december 31 2004 interest rates on certain longterm debt have been converted from variable to fixed rates as discussed under the heading interest rate swaps below 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in october 2003 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest payments on longterm debt from fixed to variable rates interest payments on 2000 million of 67 notes due in october 2005 and 1500 million of 695 notes due in march 2007 were converted from the respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor in march 2004 the company terminated these agreements resulting in cash receipts totaling 52 million with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the longterm debt this increase is being amortized over the remaining term of the respective longterm debt as a reduction to interest expense in february 2001 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variableinterestrate payments on certain leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 61 

the fair value of interest rate swaps is defined as the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period the fair value of the swap agreements is calculated quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments the fair value of the variable to fixed interest rate swaps was a liability of 17 million and 52 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the potential net loss in fair value of interest rate swaps of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in market rates was 2 million and 5 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the company’s risk related to the interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase or forecasted purchases of equipment certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with its subsidiaries outside the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options are intended to be and are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging derivatives and the fair value of such contracts is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as 

a component of other comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

as of december 31 2004 the company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in 2005 and 2006 to purchase 1031 million in foreign currency primarily australian dollars canadian dollars and euros and to sell 308 million in foreign currency primarily mexican pesos and japanese yen at contracted forward rates 

as of december 31 2003 the company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in 2004 and 2005 to purchase 577 million in foreign currency primarily canadian dollars and to sell 180 million in foreign currency primarily japanese yen at contracted forward rates 

the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and options is defined as the amount of the difference between contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of the period on a quarterly basis the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options is estimated by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of 44 million and 16 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical nearterm adverse change in market rates was 4 million and 2 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the company’s risk related to the foreign exchange contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 

commodity price risk management 

the company’s most significant raw material requirements include cocoa sugar milk peanuts and almonds the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months with regard to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts at the present time active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the company’s other major raw material requirements futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweetener natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw material and energy requirements fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the company’s transportation costs the company’s commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

the cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors including the effect of weather on crop yield other imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences after declining from an eighteenyear high in february 2003 cocoa continued to trade at relatively high price levels during 2004 continued civil unrest in the world’s largest cocoaproducing country the ivory coast resulted in volatile market conditions but has not materially affected the harvesting and marketing of the cocoa crop the company’s costs during 2005 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of relative values varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans the company’s costs for cocoa will increase in 2005 however the company expects to achieve its longterm goals for growth and profitability by a combination of selling price increases supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment 

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts unrealized gains and losses are made on a daily basis the company accounts for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 133 as amended and accordingly cash transfers are reported as a component of other comprehensive income such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs in the future futures being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 

the following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the company to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent based on the company’s net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year the company’s net commodity positions consist of the excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities relating to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products inventories priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations a loss is defined for purposes of determining market risk as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement the fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 

 the increase in fair values from 2003 to 2004 primarily reflected an increase in commodity prices during 2004 the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures being held at certain points in time during the years 

sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forwardlooking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected the important factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield other imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences in addition to changes in the company’s hedging strategies 

use of estimates and other critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period significant accounting policies employed by the company including the use of estimates are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates involved in applying the company’s accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have been 

used for the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would have a material impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations the company’s most critical accounting estimates discussed below pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable—trade accrued liabilities and pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounts receivable—trade 

in the normal course of business the company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria the company believes that it has little concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its customer base accounts receivable—trade as shown on the consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances and anticipated discounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements assessments of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions the company monitors the collectibility of its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing the credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 

over the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 the company recorded expense averaging approximately 14 million per year for potential uncollectible accounts including a 50 million provision in 2003 related to the estimate of probable exposure to the bankruptcy of one of the company’s customers fleming companies inc this provision was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2004 upon the agreement with fleming reclamation creditor’s trust which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy writeoffs of uncollectible accounts net of recoveries averaged approximately 20 million over the same period the provision for uncollectible accounts is recognized as selling marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the past three years the allowance for doubtful accounts has ranged from 2 to 3 of gross accounts receivable if reasonably possible nearterm changes in the most material assumptions were made with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable the amounts by which the annual provision would have changed would have resulted in a reduction in expense of approximately 25 million to an increase in expense of approximately 14 million changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on the company’s liquidity or capital resources 

accrued liabilities 

accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products the company utilizes numerous trade promotion programs the costs of such programs are recognized as a reduction to net sales with the recording of a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of product shipment the accrued liability for marketing promotions is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future as a result of changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products promotional costs were 5575 million 5512 million and 4616 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively reasonably possible nearterm changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs would have resulted in changes ranging from a reduction in such costs of approximately 120 million to an increase in costs of approximately 100 million with an increase or decrease to net sales and income before income taxes within that range over the last three years actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 4 changes in estimates related to the cost of promotion programs would not have a material impact on the company’s liquidity or capital resources 

at the time of sale the company estimates a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends seasonal timing and sales patterns and product movement at retail estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel current economic trends changes in consumer demand the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotion programs over the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2 of gross sales reasonably possible nearterm changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from 5 million to 10 million in each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 actual costs have not deviated from the company’s estimates by more than 1 reasonably possible nearterm changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on the company’s liquidity or capital resources 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans the principal plans are the hershey foods corporation retirement plan and the hershey foods corporation retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees the company is monitoring legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans as well as recent court cases for any impact on its plans the company also sponsors two primary postretirement benefit plans the health care plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

the company’s policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and federal income tax laws respectively nondomestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations plan assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities shortterm and longterm liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations these calculations are made considering payroll and employee data including age and years of service along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements the company takes into consideration longterm projections with regard to economic conditions including interest rates return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels with regard to liabilities associated with other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance the company takes into consideration the longterm annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions the discount rate assumption is reviewed and may be revised annually the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption “asset return assumption” for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and would be revised only when longterm asset return projections demonstrate that need 

pension plans 

the net periodic pension benefits cost for the company sponsored plans was 336 million 510 million and 298 million respectively in 2004 2003 and 2002 for 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be comparable to 2004 primarily due to a higher than expected return on plan assets during 2004 and cash contributions to the pension plans in 2005 offset by the lower 2005 discount rate the recognized net actuarial losses will be higher in 2005 due to the lower discount rate actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan’s obligations are revised from time to time the company’s policy is to amortize only unrecognized net actuarial gainslosses in excess of 10 

of the respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or fair market value of assets if greater the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2005 is 100 million based on the december 31 2004 unrecognized net actuarial loss presented in note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 2439 million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans “average remaining service period” changes to the assumed rates of participant termination disability and retirement would impact the average remaining service period an increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect however changes to these assumed rates are not anticipated at this time the 2004 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost was 98 million projections beyond 2005 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 

the company used an average discount rate assumption of 60 63 and 69 for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for its plans the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by 120 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by 102 million the company’s discount rate represents the estimated rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled in order to estimate this rate the company considers the yields of high quality securities which are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency 

the company reduced its average discount rate assumption to 57 for valuing obligations as of december 31 2004 from 60 as of december 31 2003 due to the declining interest rate environment a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december 31 2004 pension benefits obligations by 1250 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december 31 2004 pension benefits obligations by 1061 million 

asset return assumptions of 85 85 and 95 were used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefits cost was based on the fair market value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets the company considers the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets the historical geometric average return over the 17 years prior to december 31 2004 was approximately 97 the actual return on assets was 107 during 2004 with gains during 2003 of approximately 211 and losses during 2002 of 131 the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by 90 million and a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by 90 million 

the company’s pension asset investment policies specify ranges of pension asset allocation percentages for each asset class the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows equity securities 40–85 debt securities 15–60 and cash 0–10 as of december 31 2004 the actual allocations were within the ranges the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns is expected to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes disclosed 

for 2004 and 2003 the company had no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the nondomestic plans were not material however the company made contributions of 80 million in 2004 and 1203 million in 2003 to improve the funded status these contributions were fully tax deductible a one percentage point change in the discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2004 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans 

for 2005 there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the nondomestic plans will not be material however the company contributed 400 million to the domestic plans in january 2005 to improve the funded status 

postretirement benefit plans 

other postretirement benefits costs relate primarily to health care and life insurance benefits net periodic other postretirement benefits costs for the company sponsored plans were 243 million 239 million and 237 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively for the calculation of net periodic other postretirement benefits costs discount rate assumptions of 60 63 and 70 were used for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic other postretirement benefits costs a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2004 net periodic other postretirement benefits costs by 15 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2004 net periodic other postretirement benefits costs by 13 million 

the company used discount rate assumptions of 57 and 60 to value the other postretirement benefits obligations as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december 31 2004 other postretirement benefits obligations by 364 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december 31 2004 other postretirement benefits obligations by 304 million 

on december 8 2003 the president of the united states signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “2003 medicare act” the 2003 medicare act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare “medicare part d” as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the company believes that certain prescription drug benefits offered under postretirement health care plans will qualify for the subsidy under medicare part d the federal subsidy to be provided by the 2003 medicare act reduced net periodic benefits costs in 2004 by approximately 30 million and lowered the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation by approximately 252 million 

other critical accounting policies employed by the company include the following 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets other intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks customerrelated intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and therefore these assets are not being amortized customerrelated intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately ten years patents are being amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately sixteen years 

the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is performed by using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded in the second step the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the resulting 

implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 

the evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 

the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

goodwill was assigned to reporting units and transitional impairment tests were performed for goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of 2002 and the annual impairment tests were performed in the fourth quarters of 2002 2003 and 2004 no impairment of assets was determined as a result of these tests 

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations commodities futures contracts utilized by the company are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 as amended additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the net aftertax impact of cash flow hedging derivatives on comprehensive income loss reflected a 163 million gain in 2004 a 202 million loss in 2003 and a 1067 million gain in 2002 net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures contracts reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to income for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reflected in cost of sales reclassification of gains of 261 million 519 million and 179 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively were associated with commodities futures contracts gains on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately 4 million 4 million and 15 million before tax for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively no gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into income as a result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not occur there were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness the amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 187 million after tax as of december 31 2004 which were principally associated with commodities futures contracts 

return measures 

operating return on average stockholders’ equity 

the company’s operating return on average stockholders’ equity on a gaap basis was 499 in 2004 the company’s adjusted operating return on average stockholders’ equity was 447 in 2004 for the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average stockholders’ equity earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of 

intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004 the aftertax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2003 2002 and 2001 the aftertax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the company in 2002 and the aftertax gains on the sale of a group of the company’s gum brands in 2003 the sale of the luden’s throat drops business in 2001 the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000 and the sale of the pasta business in 1999 over the most recent sixyear period the adjusted return has ranged from 289 in 1999 to 447 in 2004

outlook 

the outlook section contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on current expectations actual results may differ materially key risks to achieving future performance include the continued ability to accelerate the introduction of new products while balancing the rationalization of underperforming items customer and consumer acceptance of announced price increases achievement of targeted cost improvements successful resolution of upcoming labor contract negotiations intensified competitive activity in certain markets changes to customers’ businesses and in the retail environment changes in the regulatory environment which includes tax laws as well as initiatives which could restrict or limit certain product sales the ability to improve profitability of international businesses which are subject to certain volatility with regard to the economic and foreign currency exchange environment in certain countries and the risk of increases in raw material and other costs 

during the three years ended december 31 2004 the company significantly improved operating results as it implemented its strategies over the longterm these strategies seek to deliver average net sales growth of 3–4 per year gross margin improvement of 70–90 basis points per year 7–9 annual growth in earnings before interest expense and income taxes “ebit” and 9–11 earnings per sharediluted “eps” growth per year 

the company expects continued sales growth in 2005 to be 6–7 including growth at the top end of its longterm goal for the ongoing business enhanced by the first year impact of the mauna loa and grupo lorena acquisitions the company will continue to introduce new items and limited edition line extensions during 2005 these will include a full year of sales for the following items that were introduced in 2004 hershey’s kisses brand filled with caramel milk chocolates ice breakers liquid ice mints hershey’s snack barz rice and marshmallow bars hershey’s smartzone nutrition bars take5 candy bars hershey’s almond joy york and reese’s cookies reese’s pieces candy with peanuts and reese’s big cup  previously sold as a limited edition item 

geographically net sales growth is expected to be concentrated primarily in north america growth outside north america will be focused on limited geographic areas offering attractive market opportunities 

gross margin is expected to improve 30–40 basis points in 2005 including growth approaching the lower end of the company’s longterm goal of 70–90 basis points for the ongoing business reduced by the impact of integrating the lower margin grupo lorena and mauna loa businesses margin improvement is affected by various factors including selling prices promotional allowances raw material costs supply chain efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period during 2005 improved price realization resulting from a combination of selling price increases and product weight changes combined with improved supply chain efficiencies will more than offset higher input costs primarily for raw materials transportation and employee benefits 

ebit is expected to grow within the range of the longterm goal in 2005 as a result of the net sales growth and gross margin expansion combined with careful control of selling marketing and administrative costs 

net income and eps in 2004 benefited from the nonrecurring adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the tax rate and income tax expense in 2005 the tax rate will return to a more normal rate estimated at 366 offsetting the ebit gains and resulting in relatively flat net income and eps versus 2004 excluding the impact of this nonrecurring adjustment net income and eps are expected to increase within the range of the company’s longterm goals 

the company expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2005 net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments the company will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate the plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2004 however in january 2005 a contribution of 400 million was made to improve the funded status of the domestic plans the company’s cash flow from operations is expected to remain strong during 2005 the company will repay the 2012 million of 67 notes due in 2005 by utilizing cash provided from operations and additional shortterm borrowings 

new accounting pronouncements

sfas no 123r is effective for periods beginning after june 15 2005 sfas no 123r will apply to awards granted modified or settled in cash on or after that date companies may choose from one of three methods when transitioning to the new standard which may include restatement of prior annual and interim periods the impact on eps of expensing stock options will be dependent upon the method to be used for valuation of stock options and the transition method determined by the company the total impact on an annualized basis could range from approximately 06 to 08 per sharediluted assuming option grants continue at the same level as in 2004 

in november 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 “sfas no 151” sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage paragraph 5 of arb no 43 chapter 4 previously stated that “under some circumstances items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges” sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” in addition sfas no 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the company does not expect any significant changes to its financial accounting and reporting as a result of the implementation of sfas no 151

estimates reasonably could have been used for the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would have a material impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations the company’s most critical accounting estimates pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable—trade accrued liabilities and pension and other postretirement benefit plans

employee stock options 

the company currently sponsors two stockbased employee compensation plans which are described more fully in note 16 stock compensation plans the company applies the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for those plans no employee compensation expense for stock options is reflected in net income as all stock options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share in each period if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas no 123” to stockbased employee compensation 

 the pro forma net income and dilutedpro forma earnings per share increase from other stockbased employee compensation expense represent the impact of certain performance stock units “psus” granted in 2003 which require the final award to be paid in shares of the company’s common stock the expense for these psus under the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 would have been based on grant date fair value however actual expense is adjusted for changes in the price of the company’s common stock based on the guidance in fasb interpretation no 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  as a result actual expense in 2004 and 2003 was higher than the pro forma expense calculated under the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 due to the increase in the price of the company’s common stock since the grant date 

the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions used for grants in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively dividend yields of 20 20 and 19 expected volatility of 26 28 and 28 riskfree interest rates of 37 36 and 47 and expected lives of 65 years 64 years and 64 years 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment an amendment of fasb statements no 123 and 95 “sfas no 123r” sfas no 123r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its valuable equity instruments for employee services it also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services for public entities the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments including employee stock options would be measured based on the grantdate fair value of those instruments that cost would be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period often the vesting period generally no compensation cost would be recognized for equity instruments that do not vest 

sfas no 123r is effective for periods beginning after june 15 2005 sfas no 123r will apply to awards granted modified or settled in cash on or after that date companies may choose from one of three methods when transitioning to the new standard which may include restatement of prior annual and interim periods the impact on earnings per sharediluted of expensing stock options will be dependent upon the method to be used for valuation of stock options and the transition method determined by the company the total impact on an annualized basis could range from approximately 06 to 08 per sharediluted assuming option grants continue at the same level as in 2004 

 the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of three offbalance sheet arrangements with specialpurpose trusts “spts” for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities the consolidation of these entities resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately 74 million or 03 per sharediluted in the third quarter of 2003 reflecting the aftertax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through june 29 2003 additionally the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property plant and equipment of approximately 1077 million with a corresponding increase to longterm debt of 1155 million and to other longterm liabilities of 44 million reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements prior to june 30 2003 expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income subsequent to the consolidation of these entities expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding longterm debt an increase in depreciation expense of 26 million in 2003 also resulted from the consolidation of these entities with a total of 54 million of depreciation expense recorded in 2004

as previously discussed in note 2 cumulative effect of accounting change the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of the three offbalance sheet arrangements with spts the consolidation of these entities resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately 74 million or 03 per sharediluted in the third quarter of 2003 reflecting the aftertax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through june 29 2003 additionally the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property plant and equipment of approximately 1077 million with a corresponding increase to longterm debt of 1155 million and to other longterm liabilities of 44 million reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements prior to june 30 2003 expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income subsequent to the consolidation of these entities expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding longterm debt an increase in 

depreciation expense of 26 million in 2003 also resulted from the consolidation of these entities with a total of 54 million in depreciation expense recorded in 2004 

during 1999 and 2000 the company entered into offbalance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities these offbalance sheet arrangements enabled the company to lease these facilities under more favorable terms than other leasing alternatives the lease arrangements are with spts whereby the company leases warehouse and distribution facilities in redlands california atlanta georgia and hershey pennsylvania as discussed below the spts were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the facilities to the company the spts financed the acquisition of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent thirdparty financial institutions the independent thirdparty financial institutions that hold the equity certificates are the owners of the spts the owners of the spts have made substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3 which will be at risk during the entire term of each lease accordingly the company did not consolidate the spts prior to june 30 2003 because not all of the conditions for consolidation had been met 

in december 2000 the company entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in redlands california the lease term was approximately ten years with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility the lease agreement contained an option for the company to purchase the facility in january 2002 the company assigned its right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the company under a new lease agreement the lease term is five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 401 million 

in october 2000 the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near atlanta georgia the lease term is five years with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility including land was 182 million

aside from the residual guarantees and instrument guarantees associated with the individual leasing arrangements as discussed below the company has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of these entities the company has not collateralized the obligations in connection with these leases the company has no obligations with respect to refinancing of the lessor’s debt would incur no significant penalties that would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the leases and has no significant guarantees other than the residual and instrument guarantees discussed below there are no other material commitments or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangements the company’s transactions with the spts are limited to the lease agreements the company does not anticipate entering into any other arrangements involving spes 

the leases include substantial residual guarantees by the company for a significant amount of the financing and options to purchase the facilities at original cost pursuant to instrument guarantees in the event of a default under the lease agreements the company guaranteed to the note holders and certificate holders payment in an amount equal to all sums then due under the leases 

there are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreements if the company decides not to renew any of the three leases the terms for each renewal period under each of the three lease arrangements are identical to the initial terms and do not represent bargain lease terms 

if the company were to exercise its options to purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective initial lease terms the company could purchase the facilities for a total of approximately 1200 million 799 million for the pennsylvania and georgia facilities in 2005 and 

401 million for the california facility in 2007 if the company chooses not to renew the leases or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms the company is obligated under the residual guarantees for approximately 1032 million in total for the three leases additionally the company is obligated to remarket each property on the lessor’s behalf and upon sale distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs if the company chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms the company does not anticipate a material disruption to operations since such facilities are not unique facilities with similar racking and storage capabilities are available in each of the areas where the facilities are located there are no significant leasehold improvements that would be impaired there would be no adverse tax consequences the financing of replacement facilities would not be material to the company’s cash flows and costs related to relocation would not be significant to income 

the facility located near hershey pennsylvania was constructed on land owned by the company the company entered into a ground lease with the lessor an spt the initial term of the ground lease extends to the date that is the later of i the date the facility lease is no longer in effect or ii the date when the company satisfies the residual guarantee associated with the lease an additional term for the ground lease begins upon the end of the initial ground lease term and ends upon the later of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the 75th anniversary of the ground lease commencement date if the company chooses not to renew the building lease or purchase the building it must remarket the building on the lessor’s behalf subject to the ground lease which will continue in force until the earlier of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the 75th anniversary of the ground lease inception date the lease of the warehouse and distribution facility does not include any provisions that would require the company to sell the land to the spt 

rent expense was 291 million 326 million and 346 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively rent expense pertains to all operating leases which were principally related to certain administrative buildings warehouse and distribution facilities and transportation equipment

 the company adopted sfas no 133 as amended as of january 1 2001 sfas no 133 as amended requires the company to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for the change in fair value of the derivative depends on whether the instrument qualifies for and has been designated as a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship there are three types of hedging relationships a cash flow hedge a fair value hedge and a hedge of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation the designation is based upon the exposure being hedged all derivative instruments currently utilized by the company are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 

objectives strategies and accounting policies associated with derivative instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative instruments from time to time including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts to manage variability in cash flows associated with interest rate currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures the interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases energy requirements and transportation costs if it is probable that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within 

an additional twomonth period of time derivative gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets are immediately reclassified into earnings gains and losses on terminated derivatives designated as hedges are accounted for as part of the originally hedged transaction gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges of items that mature or are sold or terminated are recognized in income in the same period as the originally hedged transaction was anticipated to affect earnings the company utilizes derivative instruments for hedging purposes only and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes in entering into these contracts the company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

interest rate swaps 

in order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in october 2003 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest payments on longterm debt from fixed to variable rates interest payments on 2000 million of 67 notes due in october 2005 and 1500 million of 695 notes due in march 2007 were converted from the respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” in march 2004 the company terminated these agreements resulting in cash receipts totaling 52 million with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the longterm debt this increase is being amortized over the remaining term of the respective longterm debt as a reduction to interest expense 

in february 2001 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variableinterestrate payments on certain leases from a variable to a fixed rate payments on leases associated with the financing of construction of a warehouse and distribution facility near hershey pennsylvania for 617 million and the financing of the purchase of a warehouse and distribution facility near atlanta georgia for 182 million are variable based on libor such variable payments are forecasted transactions as defined by sfas no 133 as amended the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the variableinterestrate payments on the leases from libor to a fixed rate of 61 future changes in libor are offset by changes in the value of the interest rate swap agreements resulting in interest expense at the fixed rate of 61 

as previously discussed in note 2 cumulative effect of accounting change the company adopted interpretation no 46 as of june 30 2003 resulting in the consolidation of the company’s three offbalance sheet arrangements with spts for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities the consolidation of those entities resulted in the recording of longterm debt of 594 million and 175 million associated with the warehouse and distribution facilities near hershey and atlanta respectively corresponding to the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as of june 30 2003 the company designated a new hedging relationship contemporaneous with the discontinuance of the preexisting hedging relationship due to the consolidation of the two corresponding spts prospectively beginning on june 30 2003 the interest rate differential on the interest rate swap agreements was classified as an adjustment to interest expense 

the variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow hedges and the notional amounts interest rates and terms of the swap agreements are consistent with the underlying lease agreements they are intended to hedge and therefore there is no hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses on the interest rate swap agreements are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged interest payments affect earnings the fair value of variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements was a liability of 17 million and 52 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively and was included on the consolidated balance sheets as other longterm liabilities with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes 

cash flows from interest rate swap agreements are classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows the company’s risk related to the interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options 

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase or forecasted purchases of equipment certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with its subsidiaries outside the united states these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months 

foreign exchange forward contracts and options are intended to be and are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments or forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies since there is a direct relationship between the foreign currency derivatives and the foreign currency denomination of the transactions foreign currency derivatives are highly effective in hedging cash flows related to transactions denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies these contracts meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and accordingly gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales or selling marketing and administrative expense in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings in entering into these contracts the company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 

the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was estimated by obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms adjusted where necessary for maturity differences the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of 44 million and 16 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively included on the consolidated balance sheets as other current assets with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes cash flows from foreign exchange forward contracts and options designated as hedges of foreign currency price risks associated with the purchase of equipment are classified as net cash flows used by provided from investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows cash flows from other foreign exchange forward contracts and options are classified as net cash provided from operating activities 

commodities futures contracts 

in connection with the purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations commodity price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months commodities futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as cash flow hedges accordingly gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized ratably in cost of sales in the same period that the hedged raw material manufacturing requirements are recorded in cost of sales 

in order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk it must be demonstrated that the changes in fair value of the commodities futures contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with commodity purchases for manufacturing requirements and with transportation costs the assessment of hedge effectiveness for commodities futures is performed on a quarterly basis by calculating the change in switch values relative to open commodities futures contracts being held and the number of futures contracts needed to price raw material purchases for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs tracking changes in basis differentials as discussed below also monitors effectiveness the prices of commodities futures contracts reflect delivery to the same locations where the company takes delivery of the physical commodities and therefore there is no ineffectiveness resulting from differences in location between the derivative and the hedged item commodities futures contracts have been deemed to be highly effective in hedging price risks associated with corresponding raw material purchases for manufacturing requirements and transportation costs 

because of the rollover strategy used for commodities futures contracts which is required by futures market conditions some ineffectiveness may result in hedging forecasted manufacturing requirements 

as futures contracts are switched from nearby contract positions to contract positions which are required to fix the price of raw material purchases for manufacturing requirements hedge ineffectiveness may also result from variability in basis differentials associated with the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing requirements hedge ineffectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis and the ineffective portion of gains or losses on commodities futures is recorded currently in cost of sales in accordance with sfas no 133 as amended 

exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts unrealized gains and losses are made on a daily basis and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials energy requirements and transportation costs in the future cash flows from commodities futures contracts are classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows futures contracts being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated manufacturing requirements for each commodity physical commodity forward purchase contracts meet the sfas no 133 as amended definition of “normal purchases and sales” and therefore are not considered derivative instruments 

the net aftertax impact of cash flow hedging derivatives on comprehensive income loss reflected a 163 million gain in 2004 a 202 million loss in 2003 and a 1067 million gain in 2002 net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures contracts reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to income for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reflected in cost of sales reclassification of gains of 261 million 519 million and 179 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively were associated with commodities futures contracts gains on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately 4 million 4 million and 15 million before tax for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively no gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into income as a result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not occur there were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as of december 31 2004 the amount of net aftertax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts and options interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately 187 million which was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states these standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by coso also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by coso

the company recognizes that the mass distribution of its confectionery and grocery products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers the company attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution to achieve these objectives the company has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico the company uses a combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers in conjunction with sales and marketing efforts the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective promotion of new as well as established products on both national and regional scales 

from time to time the company has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value the company implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size king size variety pack 6pack and 10pack lines effective january 1 2003 the standard size increase was approximately 11 percent the effect of all the increases translated into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire domestic product line the last standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the company in december 1995 

the most significant raw material used in the production of the company’s chocolate products is cocoa beans this commodity is imported principally from far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s crop cocoa beans are not uniform and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas the company buys a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the new york board of trade because of the company’s forward purchasing practices discussed below and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the company’s average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products 

cocoa futures contract prices cents per pound  source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

after rising sharply in 2002 cocoa market prices reached an eighteenyear high in february 2003 before gradually declining but remaining at levels somewhat higher than prices prior to 2002 continued civil unrest in the world’s largest cocoaproducing country the ivory coast has resulted in volatile market conditions but has not materially affected the harvesting and marketing of the cocoa crop the company’s costs during 2004 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of relative values varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans the company’s costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004 however the company expects to achieve its goals for growth and profitability over the foreseeable future by a combination of improved sales mix supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment 

the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 which is a sixyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

the price of sugar the company’s second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate and confectionery products is subject to price supports under the above referenced farm legislation due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar established by that legislation sugar prices paid by united states users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market the average wholesale list price of refined sugar fob northeast has remained in a range of 25¢ to 32¢ per pound for the past ten years united states peanut prices traded around 40¢ per pound during 2003 and are expected to remain near that level in 2004 almond prices began strengthening during the second quarter of 2003 and continued to increase during the second half of the year due to strong global demand and a weakening us dollar prices began the year at 150 per pound were at 200 per pound as of december 31 2003 and are expected to remain firm during 2004 milk prices remained low in 2003 as a result of higher than normal inventories of butter and skim milk powder prices began to increase late in the fourth quarter as milk and butter production fell below year earlier levels and butter inventories declined milk prices in 2004 are expected to increase moderately from 2003 levels the company believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months with regard to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts at the present time active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the company’s other major raw material requirements futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweetener natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the company’s transportation costs the company’s commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

the primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products cash outflows and inflows result from original margins that are “good faith deposits” established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations additionally variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements the magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets cash flows related to margin requirements historically have not been material to the company’s total working capital requirements 

the company manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities these procurement strategies including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas transportation costs and certain dairy products are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the company’s business since the cost of raw materials energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales procurement strategies with regard to cocoa sugar and other major raw material requirements energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals including weather and crop analysis imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences and by discussions with market analysts brokers and dealers procurement strategies are determined implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the company’s board of directors the “board” on a regular basis 

competition many of the company’s brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace however these brands are sold in highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational national regional and local firms some of which have resources in excess of those available to the company 

trademarks the company owns various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to the company’s business 

backlog of orders the company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales nor are the changes from time to time significant 

research and development the company engages in a variety of research activities these principally involve development of new products improvement in the quality of existing products improvement and modernization of production processes and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines information concerning the company’s research and development expense is contained in note 1 of the company’s annual report to stockholders attached hereto and filed as exhibit 13 and incorporated herein by reference

the corporation’s marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior quality of its products mass distribution and the best possible consumer value in terms of price and weight in addition the corporation devotes considerable resources to the identification development testing manufacturing and marketing of new products the corporation utilizes a variety of promotional programs for customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers the corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to stimulate sales of certain products confectionery and grocery seasonal and holidayrelated sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year 

the corporation recognizes that the mass distribution of its confectionery and grocery products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers the corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution to achieve these objectives the corporation has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the united states canada and mexico the corporation uses a combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers in conjunction with sales and marketing efforts the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective promotion of new as well as established products on both national and regional scales 

from time to time the corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs the competitive environment and profit objectives while at the same time maintaining consumer value the corporation implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size king size variety pack 6pack and 10pack lines effective january 1 2003 the standard size increase was approximately 11 percent the effect of all the increases translates into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire domestic product line the last standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the corporation in december 1995 

the most significant raw material used in the production of the corporation’s chocolate products is cocoa beans this commodity is imported principally from far eastern west african and south american equatorial regions west africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s crop cocoa beans are not uniform and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas the corporation buys a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated the prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the new york board of trade because of the corporation’s forward purchasing practices discussed below and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the corporation’s average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products 

cocoa futures contract prices cents per pound  source international cocoa organization quarterly bulletin of cocoa statistics 

cocoa market prices rose sharply during 2002 and this increase accelerated following a rebellion in the world’s largest cocoa producing country the ivory coast continued civil unrest in the ivory coast could result in further cocoa price increases the corporation’s costs during 2003 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices premiums and discounts reflective of relative values varying delivery times and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans the corporation’s costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004 however the corporation expects to achieve its longterm goals for growth and profitability by a combination of possible price increases andor product weight changes improved sales mix supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset potential cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment 

the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 which is a sixyear farm bill impacts the prices of sugar corn peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities 

the price of sugar the corporation’s second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate and confectionery products is subject to price supports under the above referenced farm legislation due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar established by that legislation sugar prices paid by united states users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market the average wholesale list price of refined sugar fob northeast has remained in a range of 25 ¢ to 32 ¢ per pound for the past ten years us peanut prices declined approximately 25 percent during the fourth quarter of 2002 due to a decrease in price support levels almond prices remained near normal levels throughout 2002 milk prices decreased in 2002 as a result of increasing milk production the corporation believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements 

the corporation attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for periods from 3 to 24 months with regard to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts at the present time active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the corporation’s other major raw material requirements futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa sugar corn sweetener natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the corporation’s transportation costs the corporation’s commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

the primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas fuel oil and certain dairy products cash outflows and inflows result from original margins which are “good faith deposits” established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations additionally variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements the magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets cash flows related to margin requirements were significant during 2002 as a result of unusual volatility in market prices but historically have not been material to the corporation’s total working capital requirements 

the corporation manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities these procurement strategies including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa sugar corn sweeteners natural gas transportation costs and certain dairy products are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the corporation’s business since the cost of raw materials energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales procurement strategies with regard to cocoa sugar and other major raw material requirements energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals including weather and crop analysis other imbalances between supply and demand currency exchange rates political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences and by discussions with market analysts 

brokers and dealers procurement strategies are determined implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the board of directors on a regular basis
