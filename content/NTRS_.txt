payment of dividends 

the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the federal reserve board including the stress capital buffer requirement discussed further in “—capital adequacy requirements” below dividends from the bank are a significant source of funds for the corporation and the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends on the ability of the bank to pay sufficient dividends to the corporation 

various other federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank to the corporation without regulatory consent the bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized in general the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar year is limited to its “recent earnings” the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years or its “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus whichever is less the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation may also be affected by the capital adequacy standards applicable to the bank discussed further below which include minimum requirements and buffers 



capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to the federal reserve board’s capital plan rules which require the corporation to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review 

the major components of that oversight are the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar and doddfrank act stress tests dfast these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available 

under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available northern trust published the results of its most recent companyrun stress tests on june 24 2021 

capital adequacy requirements 

the corporation as a bank holding company is subject to riskbased and leverage capital guidelines implemented by the federal reserve board that are based on industrystandard guidelines published by the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee known as basel iii the bank as an fdicinsured depository institution is also required to meet riskbased and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation with the bank is a “core” banking organization that is required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly its riskbased capital ratios the corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach to calculating riskbased capital ratios the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy 

the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios at december 31 2021 were well above the regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2021 



1 in november 2019 the federal reserve board and other us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that established a deduction for central bank deposits from the total leverage exposures of custodial banking organizations including the corporation and the bank equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april 1 2020 the supplementary leverage ratios at december 31 2021 for the corporation and the bank reflect the impact of this final rule 

advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 advanced approaches institutions that are insured depository institutions such as the bank also must maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” the corporation is also subject to a stress capital buffer which integrates forwardlooking stress test results with nonstress capital requirements and the bank is also subject to a capital conservation buffer which respectively requires the corporation and the bank to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in order to avoid constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation the minimum capital buffer requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank is 25 



a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation is also a component of the capital adequacy framework in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 

as a result of the stress test results published by the federal reserve board on june 24 2021 the corporation’s stress capital buffer requirement for the 2021 capital plan cycle was set at 25 the 2021 stress capital buffer became effective october 1 2021 and results in an effective common equity tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement of 70 inclusive of this buffer

 item 1a  risk factors 

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients counterparties andor applicable regulators have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely further we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face and you should not interpret discussion of any risk to imply that such risk has not already materialized 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

covid19 pandemicrelated risks 

our business and results of operations generally have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and governmental and societal responses thereto have had a severe impact on global economic and market conditions including heightened volatility in financial markets global supply chain disruptions and the institution of social distancing and travel restrictions that resulted in temporary closures of many businesses lost revenues and lower levels of employment although certain economic conditions have improved since their worst levels during the pandemic the pandemic continues to evolve as recently experienced with the rapid spread of variants and continuing outbreaks and certain of the impacts of the pandemic may continue to affect aspects of our business and results of operations in the future 

these conditions have impacted—or may in the future impact—our business results of operations and financial condition negatively including through lower net interest income resulting from lower interest rates increased provisions for credit losses lower revenue from certain of our feebased businesses impairments on the securities we hold and decreased demand for certain of our products and services additionally our liquidity and regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets volatility in foreign exchange rates deposit flows and client draws on lines of credit our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic in some cases the covid19 pandemic has accelerated the transition from traditional to digital financial services and heightened customer expectations in this area and this transition may require us to invest greater resources in technological advancements further workfromhome and other modified business practices may introduce additional operational risks including resiliency cybersecurity and execution risks which may result in inefficiencies or delays and may affect our ability to or the manner in which we conduct our business activities 

governments have taken and may in the future continue to take measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses stabilize the markets and support economic growth the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate fully the negative impact of the ongoing pandemic andor may result in consequences—intended or unintended—that negatively impact our business 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration spread and severity of covid19 and the rise of variants the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact including vaccine and testing mandates the acceptance and efficacy of a global vaccine distribution plan and 



the timing and extent that normal economic and operating conditions resume the ongoing pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section entitled “risk factors” and any subsequent filings with the sec 

market risks 

we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide 

our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions for example poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients further broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products could impact our earnings negatively 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve board further reduced interest rates which generally had already been low relative to historical levels while current market expectations are that interest rates will rise in the future to the extent rates remain historically low we may continue to experience a compressed net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding lowinterestrate environments also have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates and expect to continue to do so until interest rates rise sufficiently low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

conversely in some circumstances a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yields and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 

further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 

changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary trade and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing and play a role in contributing to or moderating levels of inflation all of which meaningfully impact our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by 



increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary trade and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices additionally financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including current events involving ukraine and russia terrorism or other geopolitical events economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 

volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients’ earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues 



operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope some or all of which may be exacerbated by the shift to workfromhome arrangements implemented in recent years include 

• failures of technological systems or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from computer viruses or cyberattacks 

• human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures 

• theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties 

• defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems 

• breakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations 

• unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades 

• defects in product design or delivery 

• difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from thirdparty vendors 

• negative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and 

• external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as pandemics geopolitical events political or social unrest natural disasters or acts of terrorism 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types evolve—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business including operational resiliency financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 

failures of or disruptions to our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the processing storage and transmission of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information resulting in the theft loss destruction gathering monitoring or other misappropriation of this information additionally we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing cybersecurity data privacy and data protection which may differ and potentially conflict in various jurisdictions regulators globally are introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the misappropriation of such information most states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and notification of data breaches these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase compliance costs and the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information 

information security and data privacy risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective information security and data privacy relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties also like many large 



enterprises in response to the covid19 pandemic we have shifted the majority of our professionals to remote work arrangements and expect that many will continue to work remotely to some extent even as we begin to institute returntooffice plans this change has enabled us successfully to continue business operations but also introduces potential new vulnerabilities to cyber threats additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business while we conduct security assessments on thirdparty vendors we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets as well as third parties with whom they share information used for authentication to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm we and our clients have been and expect to continue to be subject to a wide variety of cyberattacks and threats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks and phishing attacks and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from a breach because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered in addition successful cyberattacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident 

we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to security incidents including regulatory investigations and actions further the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction with security incidents each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation although we maintain insurance covering information theft damage or destruction from cyber breach incidents there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate 

further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it 



plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology andor to compete for and retain employees with the necessary technical skills and expertise could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors or their vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors or their vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal public health or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets our nonus operations accounted for 31 of our revenue in 2021 our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in 



which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political public health and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments money laundering and laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 

failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs as a result of our failure to execute on our strategies successfully an overall inflationary environment or otherwise could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position 

pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism global conflicts including current events involving ukraine and russia or other similar events have had in the past or may in the future have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events may still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict please see “strategic risks” and “covid19 pandemicrelated risks” in this “risk factors” section for further description of risks associated with climate change and the ongoing covid19 pandemic respectively 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be 



inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively 

the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past increased and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the transition away from libor or changes in the method pursuant to which other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

many financial markets currently rely on interbank offered rates each an ibor as mutually agreed upon reference rates serving as the basis for the pricing and valuation of assets trading positions loans and other financial transactions global regulators have taken steps to discontinue the publication and use of ibor rates encourage the development and use of alternative reference rates and examine the ibor transition preparations of regulated entities such as northern trust while there are multiple ibors libor is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in the world and serves as the reference rate for our floatingrate funding certain of the products that we own or offer various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved and many derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients’ risk on march 5 2021 ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of us dollar libor usd libor and other ibors announced that publication of 1week and 2month usd libor would cease at the end of 2021 publication of the remaining usd libor tenors will continue until june 30 2023 to provide additional time to wind down and negotiate existing contracts that reference these rates globally financial market participants have begun to transition away from libor and other ibors to alternative reference rates and in accordance with guidance from us regulators including the federal reserve board we stopped offering usd libor in new contracts and began offering the secured overnight finance rate sofr as an alternative to libor in 2021 

while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor a group of large banks and the alternative reference rate committee arrc identified and the federal reserve bank of new york in may 2018 started to publish sofr as its preferred alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities sofr has different characteristics than libor and may demonstrate less predictable behavior over time and across different monetary market and economic environments therefore it is unclear whether and when markets will adopt sofr as a widely accepted replacement for libor various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the united states and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of other alternative rate benchmarks the elimination of libor or any other change in the availability or calculation of libor or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floatingrate funding the yield on loans or securities held by us the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into the value of loans securities or derivative instruments held by us or our clients which in the case of assets held by our clients could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets the trading market for securities based on libor or other benchmarks the terms of new loans being made using different or modified 



reference rates or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively while we are working to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative interest rate benchmarks for us and our clients and have begun offering sofr as a libor alternative there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other interest rate benchmarks or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor or other interest rate benchmarks further the transition away from the use of libor and the adoption of alternative interest rate benchmarks or uncertainty related to any such transition or adoption has caused and may in the future cause us to recognize additional costs it may also cause us to experience operational disruptions or result in client disputes or litigation which may negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity risks 

if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation 

in addition a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 

for more information on regulations and other regulatory changes relating to liquidity see “supervision and regulation—liquidity standards” in item 1 “business” any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” in item 1 “business” 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 



downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations andor supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by domestic and foreign governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions these regulations cover a variety of matters including prohibited activities required capital levels resolution planning human trafficking and modern slavery and privacy and data protection some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the bank the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies whether formal or based upon supervisory expectations on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly 

various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives these initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and these likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict 

for example we are unable to predict what if any changes to financial services laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the us congress and what the impact of any such changes will be upon our business financial condition and results of operations moreover the current us presidential administration has made and is expected to make further changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies which are likely to impact the rulemaking supervision examination and enforcement priorities and policies of such agencies the potential impacts of which if any we cannot predict with certainty at this time 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management 



businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition regulators tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing 

claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 

we may be impacted adversely by supervisory andor regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various governmental enforcement inquiries supervisory examinations investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with both supervisory and enforcement matters we may face limits on our ability to conduct or expand our business be required to implement corrective actions that increase the costs of conducting business or become subject to civil or criminal penalties or other remedial sanctions any of which could result in reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on us regulatory enforcement activity and supervisory expectations may heighten relative to the recent past as personnel from the current us presidential administration assume positions of leadership in the agencies that regulate or supervise us 

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap the process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate 

the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union remains uncertain 

while the uk’s withdrawal from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” officially became effective on december 31 2020 certain items remain to be negotiated therefore the final impact remains uncertain in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that entered into force on may 1 2021 while the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu it generally does not address the regulation of financial services instead in march 2021 the uk and the eu agreed upon a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues between the parties in a memorandum of understanding which is expected to be signed after certain formal steps are completed 

consequently the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of the postbrexit relationships that remain to be negotiated between the uk and other eu nations particularly in the area of financial services we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur additional costs associated with brexit planning measures while unforeseen political regulatory or other developments related to brexit or operational issues associated with the organizational restructuring related thereto also may result in additional costs and disruption to our uk and eu businesses 

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 

strategic risks 

if we are not able to attract retain and motivate personnel our business could be negatively affected 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we 



engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain necessary personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent in addition our current or future approach to inoffice and remote work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors and may not be conducive to a collaborative working environment which could adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate employees the unexpected loss of services of necessary personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of necessary employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely the current competitive labor market may also have the effect of heightening many of these risks 

our operations businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or concerns related thereto 

there is increasing concern over the risks that climate change presents to our business financial condition and results of operations the physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such developments could disrupt our operations those of our clients or third parties on which we rely further the consequences of climate change could negatively impact our clients’ ability to pay outstanding loans reduce the value of collateral or result in insurance shortfalls 

climate change could also result in transition risk changes in consumer andor investor preferences new legislation and expanded regulatory requirements related to climate risk could adversely impact us or our clients if we do not identify quantify and mitigate such risks successfully we may experience financial losses litigation reputational harm and losses of investor and stakeholder confidence 

if we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully our growth may be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent development and execution of our business strategies a failure to develop and execute these strategies may impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities have the ability to impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed or completed in the time frame anticipated if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a 



reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

the failure or perceived failure to meet or appropriately address client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations operational failures legal and regulatory requirements potential conflicts of interest cybersecurity and privacy social and sustainability concerns related to our business activities or any other of the risks discussed in this item 1a could materially and adversely affect our reputation as well as our ability to attract and retain clients or employees additionally the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates vendors or other third parties with which we do business the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation and significantly harm our business prospects damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock failure to maintain our reputation ultimately could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively or lead to a general loss of confidence in or impact market perception of financial institutions that could negatively affect us further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 

we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current “fintech” environment in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 

our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation 



negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income deductions tax credits or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 

our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the federal reserve board 

a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 



our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock and series e noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series e preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to maintain the common stock dividend level in a manner comparable to our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” and “supervision and regulation—capital planning and stress testing” in item 1 “business”

revenue 

northern trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust investment and other servicing fees net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 

revenue in 2021 of 646 billion increased 3637 million or 6 from 610 billion in 2020 noninterest income represented 79 and 76 of total revenue in 2021 and 2020 respectively and totaled 508 billion in 2021 which increased 4242 million or 9 from 466 billion in 2020

trust investment and other servicing fees 

trust investment and other servicing fees were 436 billion in 2021 compared with 400 billion in 2020 and are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody managed or serviced the volume of transactions securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears lowinterestrate environments have historically had a negative impact on fees earned on certain products 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 the corporation began to waive a portion of certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the lowinterestrate environment northern trust voluntarily waived 2878 million and 293 million of money market mutual fund fees for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively these fee waivers are impacted by the level of yields earned and account balances in certain funds as the yields in these funds remain insufficient to pay the stated fees associated with such funds if the level of shortterm interest rates were to increase as currently expected fee waivers would likely decline 

the components of trust investment and other servicing fees are provided in the following table 

table 6 trust investment and other servicing fees 



corporate  institutional services 

cis trust investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody fund administration investment management and securities lending custody and fund administration fees the largest component of cis fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custodyadministration transaction volumes and the number of accounts the asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

arrangements negotiated with each client custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on monthend market values quarterend market values or the average of monthend market values for the quarter the fund administration fees that are assetvaluerelated are priced using monthend quarterend or average daily balances investment management fees are based generally on market values of client assets under management throughout the period typically the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a onemonth or onequarter lag 

securities lending revenue is affected by market values the demand for securities to be lent which drives volumes and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed the other services fee category in cis includes such products as investment risk and analytical services benefit payments and other services revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee 

custody and fund administration fees increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to favorable markets new business and favorable currency translation investment management fees decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to higher money market mutual fund fee waivers partially offset by favorable markets and new business

asu 201613 adopted on january 1 2020 replaced the legacy otti model with an estimated credit loss model refer to the caption investment security gains and losses” in note 4 “securities” and the caption “allowance for held to maturity debt securities portfolio” in note 7 “allowance for credit losses” included under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net interest income 

net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds adjusted for the impact of interestrelated hedging activity earning assets — including federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell interestbearing due from banks federal reserve and other central bank deposits and other securities and loans and leases — are financed by a large base of interestbearing funds that include client deposits shortterm borrowings senior notes and longterm debt shortterm borrowings include federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings earning assets also are funded by noninterestrelated funds which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interestbearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates in addition the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income 

net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interestearning assets 

net interest income stated on an fte basis is a nongaap financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes when adjusted to an fte basis yields on taxable nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable however the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided in “supplemental information—reconciliation to fully taxable equivalent” within this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section

reporting segment financial information presented on an internal managementreporting basis is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment and incorporates processes for allocating assets liabilities equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing ftp methodology under the methodology assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk liquidity risk and other product characteristics on an instrument level additionally segment information is presented on an fte basis as management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income 

equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including but not limited to risk regulatory considerations and internal metrics allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities the accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments northern trust’s presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions 

revenues expenses and average assets are allocated to cis and wealth management with the exception of nonrecurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions divestitures litigation restructuring and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment which are reported within the other segment 

reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made the results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies which are typically reflected on a prospective basis 

effective january 1 2021 northern trust implemented enhancements to its ftp methodology including enhancements impacting the allocation of net interest income between cis and wealth management these methodology enhancements affect the results of each of these reporting segments due to the lack of historical information segment results for periods ended prior to january 1 2021 have not been revised to reflect the methodology enhancements

nonaccrual assets as of december 31 2021 decreased from december 31 2020 primarily due to net payoffs in the residential real estate and commercial and institutional portfolios partially offset by a net increase in the commercial real estate portfolio in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and the risk of credit losses nonaccrual assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts changes in the level of nonaccrual assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the allowance evaluated on an individual basis and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance evaluated on a collective basis within the allowance for credit losses 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk offbalance sheet credit exposure and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process northern trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis a financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption in determining an appropriate allowance level management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates and takes into consideration past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts 

the results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trust’s credit loss reserve committee which receives input from credit risk management treasury corporate finance the economic research group and each of northern trust’s business units 

as of december 31 2021 the allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit htm debt securities and other financial assets was 1384 million 341 million 112 million and 10 million respectively as of december 31 2020 the allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit htm debt securities and other financial assets was 1907 million 611 million 73 million and 08 million respectively for additional information relating to the allowance for credit losses and the changes in the allowance for credit losses during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 due to chargeoffs recoveries and provisions for credit losses refer to note 7 “allowance for credit losses” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

the following table shows the net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans and leases by segment and class at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

table 38 net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans and leases 



net recoveries chargeoffs for the following segments were zero and therefore excluded from the above table as the ratio of net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans and leases is also zero lease financing net other and nonus the average loans and leases balances were also not provided in the table for lease financing net other and nonus 

total average loans and leases for all loan portfolio categories were 372 billion 335 billion and 311 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the sec requires the disclosure of the allowance for credit losses that is applicable to international operations the disclosure has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining nonus operating performance the amounts disclosed should not be construed as being the only amounts that are available for nonus loan chargeoffs since the entire allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both us and nonus loans in addition these amounts are not intended to be indicative of future chargeoff trends please refer to the following table for the nonus allowance balances

the following table shows the allowance evaluated on an individual and collective basis for the loans and leases portfolio by segment and class at december 31 2021 and 2020 

table 39 allocation of the allowance for credit losses 



allowance related to credit exposure evaluated on an individual basis the allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans leases and lendingrelated commitments that have defaulted generally those with borrower ratings of 8 and 9 that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

the allowance evaluated on an individual basis for loans and leases decreased 06 million from 107 million at december 31 2020 to 101 million at december 31 2021 primarily attributable to a decrease in outstanding loans in the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios partially offset by an increase in outstanding loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio 

allowance related to credit exposure evaluated on a collective basis expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics if financial assets are deemed to not share similar risk characteristics an individual assessment is warranted 

the allowance evaluated on a collective basis for loans and leases decreased 787 million to 1624 million at december 31 2021 compared with 2411 million at december 31 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics and was driven by improvements in projected economic conditions and portfolio credit quality partially offset by portfolio growth the decrease in the collective basis reserve was primarily reflected in the commercial and institutional portfolio  

overall allowance the evaluation of the reserve evaluated on an individual and collective basis resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 1847 million at december 31 2021 compared with 2599 million at the end of 2020 the allowance of 1384 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 034 at december 31 2021 which decreased from a 1907 million allowance assigned to loans and leases representing 056 of total loans and leases at december 31 2020 allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 341 million and 611 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

shortterm borrowings 

during the third quarter of 2021 northern trust became a government securities division gsd netting and sponsoring member in the fixed income clearing corporation ficc sponsored member program ficc a whollyowned subsidiary of the depository trust  clearing corporation is a central counterparty and provides netting and settlement for the us government securities marketplace northern trust nets securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when ficc is the counterparty 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest to minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored limits are set on exposure with counterparties and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed it is northern trust’s policy to take possession either directly or via thirdparty custodians of securities purchased under agreements to resell securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by or pledged to the counterparty until the repurchase see note 5 “securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase” note 26 “commitments and contingent liabilities” and note 28 “offsetting of assets and liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

geographic area information 

northern trust’s nonus activities are primarily related to its asset servicing asset management foreign exchange cash management and commercial banking businesses the operations of northern trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both us and nonus source assets nonus source assets are not separately identified in northern trust’s internal management reporting system however northern trust is required to disclose nonus activities based on the domicile of the customer due to the complex and integrated nature of northern trust’s activities it is difficult to segregate with precision assets between us and nonusdomiciled customers therefore certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate assets between us and nonus operations 

the following tables present selected average assets and liabilities attributable to nonus operations based on the obligor’s domicile and the percent of those balances to total consolidated average assets for additional information refer to note 32 “reporting segments and related information” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

nonus outstandings 

as used in this discussion nonus outstandings are crossborder outstandings as defined by the sec they consist of loans securities interestbearing deposits with financial institutions accrued interest and other monetary assets not included are letters of credit loan commitments and nonus office local currency claims on residents nonus outstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of tangible liquid collateral realizable outside the country however transactions with branches of nonus banks are included in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the nonus bank’s head office 

shortterm interbank time deposits with nonus banks represent the largest category of nonus outstandings northern trust actively participates in the interbank market with us and nonus banks 

northern trust places deposits with nonus counterparties that have strong internal northern trust risk ratings and external credit ratings these nonus banks are approved and monitored by northern trust’s capital markets credit committee which has credit authority for exposure to all nonus banks and approves credit limits this process includes financial analysis of the nonus banks use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or general market conditions separate from the entityspecific review process the average life to maturity of deposits with nonus banks is deliberately maintained on a shortterm basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions northern trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of collateral andor balance sheet netting additionally the capital markets credit committee oversees countryrisk analyses and imposes limits on country exposure for additional information refer to note 32 “reporting segments and related information” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

table 42 cash flow activity summary 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily attributable to period earnings and the impact of higher noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties and in receivables 

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash provided by operating activities of 19 billion primarily reflected period earnings and the impact of higher noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization and provision for credit losses 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 186 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily attributable to increased levels of deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks higher levels of loans and leases and net purchases of afs debt securities partially offset by lower levels of interestbearing deposits with banks 

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash used in investing activities of 299 billion primarily reflected higher levels of deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks net purchases of htm debt securities higher levels of loans and leases and net purchases of afs debt securities

capital management 

one of northern trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients counterparties creditors regulators and stockholders a strong capital position helps northern trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments 

senior management with oversight from the capital governance committee and the full board of directors is responsible for capital management and planning northern trust manages its capital on both a total corporation basis and a legal entity basis the capital committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the capital policy approved by the capital governance committee of the board of directors in establishing the metrics related to capital a variety of factors are taken into consideration including the unique risk profiles of northern trust’s businesses regulatory requirements capital levels relative to peers and the impact on credit ratings 

capital levels strengthened in 2021 as average stockholders’ equity increased 5044 million or 5 reaching 117 billion total stockholders’ equity was 120 billion at december 31 2021 as compared to 117 billion at december 31 2020 preferred dividends totaling 418 million were declared in 2021 during 2021 the corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend of 070 per common share common dividends totaling 5939 million were declared in 2021 during the year ended december 31 2021 the corporation repurchased 2527544 shares of common stock including 394326 shares withheld related to sharebased compensation at an average price per share of 10590

2 adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities 

3 in november 2019 the federal reserve board and other us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that established a deduction for central bank deposits from the total leverage exposures of custodial banking organizations including the corporation and the bank equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april 1 2020 

further on april 1 2020 the federal reserve board issued an interim final rule that requires bank holding companies including the corporation to deduct on a temporary basis deposits with the federal reserve board and investments in us treasury securities from their total leverage exposure the us treasury securities deduction is applied in addition to the central bank deposits relief referred to above this rule became effective on april 1 2020 and expired on april 1 2021 

on may 15 2020 the us federal banking agencies released an interim final rule that permits insured depository institutions of bank holding companies also to temporarily exclude deposits with the federal reserve board and investments in us treasury securities from their total leverage exposure the bank did not elect to take this deduction 

the supplementary leverage ratios at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 for the corporation and the bank reflect the impact of these final rules

critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 

allowance for credit losses 

the corporation adopted accounting standards update asu no 201613 “financial instruments—credit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” asu 201613 on january 1 2020 which significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments upon adoption of asu 201613 the corporation recorded a 137 million increase in the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings 101 million net of income taxes for more information on the adoption of asu 201613 please refer to note 2 “recent accounting pronouncements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the allowance for credit losses — which represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk offbalance sheet credit exposure and specific borrower relationships — is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process northern trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis a financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption in determining an appropriate allowance level management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates and takes into consideration past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2021 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

evaluated on a collective basis expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics if financial assets are deemed to not share similar risk characteristics an individual assessment is warranted 

the allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the corporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments based on loan and obligorspecific factors including loan type borrower type collateral type loan size and borrower credit quality for each segment the probability of default and loss given default are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument for the first two years the reasonable and supportable period these 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar factors for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period northern trust reverts to its longrun historical loss experiences on a straightline basis over four quarters the projected exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarterend with adjustments made for potential draws on offbalance sheet commitments 

for each of the different parameters specific credit models for the individual loan segments were developed for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance the quantitative allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework through which management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute adjustments to the quantitative allowance that may impact individual or multiple segments of the loan portfolio 

asu 201613 requires the use of projected macroeconomic factors the corporation uses multiple forecasts approved by northern trust’s macroeconomic scenario development committee msdc the baseline forecast aligns with the corporation’s latest thinking on macroeconomic projections for the next eight quarters the forecasts are weighted at each evaluation period and are management’s best estimate of future economic projections at that time 

the allowance estimate is sensitive to changes in portfolio composition portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts increases in the amount of borrowing and material downgrades to the quality of the lending portfolio will increase the reserve all else equal similarly deteriorating projections for macroeconomic conditions will increase the reserve macroeconomic factors that are particularly correlated to northern trust’s loan and lease portfolio are equity market values market volatility corporate profits residential and commercial real estate price indices unemployment and disposable income to demonstrate the sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions northern trust applied a 100 probability weighting to downturn conditions resulting in an increase to the collective component of the allowance for the loan and lease portfolio of approximately 1283 million the investment security and other financial assets portfolios are less sensitive to macroeconomic factors in terms of overall reserve impact due to factors such as high credit quality short duration and low historical losses 

the commercial and institutional ci portfolio utilizes northern trust’s internal borrower rating assessments to determine initial credit quality a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of upgrades or downgrades by shifting the rating up or down by one rating class assuming no changes to other factors such as macroeconomic projections or qualitative adjustments the analysis excludes defaulted loans and does not assume a default event hence borrowers at the lowest nondefault rating were not downgraded similarly those at the highest rating could not be upgraded assuming the final forecast probability weighting the collective component of the allowance assigned to the ci portfolio would increase by approximately 781 million if all ci borrowers were downgraded by one performing rating class the ci collective allowance would decrease by approximately 213 million if borrower ratings were upgraded by one rating class if possible 

the results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trust’s credit loss reserve committee which receives input from credit risk management treasury corporate finance the economic research group and each of northern trust’s business units the credit loss reserve committee determines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by msdc and also reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with northern trust’s qualitative adjustment framework 

evaluated on an individual basis the allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of financial assets that have defaulted that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

analysis and controls the quarterly analysis of the individual and collective allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification and estimation of individual expected credit losses in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed at least annually and modified as considered appropriate 

management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately considers these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be greater or less than actual net chargeoffs in any particular period

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees us qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan us nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the average remaining service period of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us qualified plan in 2021 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 275 as of december 31 2020 305 as of june 30 2021 and 306 as of september 30 2021 and 303 as of december 31 2021 the application of settlement accounting in 2021 required interim remeasurements of the us qualified plan throughout 2021 the discount rate utilized for the us nonqualified plan as of december 31 2020 was 245  for both plans the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 900 to 250 that averaged 497 the expected longterm rate of return on us qualified plan assets was 525 as of both december 31 2020 and june 30 2021 and 500 as of september 30 2021 

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us pension plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2021 measurement date the following were considered 

• discount rate northern trust estimates the discount rate for its us pension plans by applying the plan specific projected cash flows for future benefit payments for each plan to the aon aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date this yield curve is composed of individual zerocoupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99year time horizon zerocoupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aarated corporate bonds this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 303 and 280 at december 31 2021 for the us qualified and us nonqualified plans respectively 

• compensation level based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from 900 to 250 that averages 497 

• rate of return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the longterm 30 years rate of return on plan assets which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness as a result of these analyses northern trust’s rate of return assumption for the us qualified plan is 525 for 2022 

• mortality table as of december 31 2021 northern trust has adopted the aggregate pri2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2019 northern trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale mp2021 which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2021 this assumption was updated at december 31 2021 from improvement scale mp2020 the updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in slightly higher projected mortality improvement rates than estimated by the mp2020 improvement scale mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the irs prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2022 

excluding pension settlement charges net pension expense in 2022 is expected to decrease by approximately 101 million primarily driven by lower loss amortization due to strong asset returns in previous years and the 2021 settlement recognition 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected us pension plans’ periodic pension expense in 2022 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 44 sensitivity of us pension plans assumptions 



pension contributions the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 there were no contributions to the us qualified plan for the 2021 plan year the minimum required contribution to the us qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2022 the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 4130 million for 2022 

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2021 approximately 21 of northern trust’s total assets and less than 1 of total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as of december 31 2020 approximately 25 of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1 of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 6 and 7 of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 94 of northern trust’s assets and 96 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment debt securities classified as afs make up 98 of level 2 assets with the remaining 2 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 93 of northern trust’s assets and 98 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment debt securities classified as afs make up 97 of level 2 assets with the remaining 3 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include afs and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 96 and 95 respectively were measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million and 10 million shares of visa inc class b common stock visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 26 “commitments and contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities including overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity

physical and financial collateral northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies 

netting onbalance sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting agreements netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits

the corporation’s liquidity defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets was 17 billion and 25 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively during and at yearend 2021 and 2020 these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries as needed average liquidity during 2021 and 2020 was 18 billion and 27 billion respectively the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 34 “northern trust corporation corporation only” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

uses of liquidity 

liquidity supports a variety of activities including client withdrawals purchases of securities net loan growth and draws on commitments to extend credit 

the corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation’s stockholders the payment of principal and interest to note holders repurchases of its common stock and investments in or loans to its subsidiaries the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2021 were 5833 million of common stock dividends repayments of senior notes and floating rate capital debt of 5000 million and 2788 million respectively and 2676 million of common stock repurchases 

credit ratings 

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2021 provided in the following table allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 

table 47 northern trust credit ratings as of december 31 2021 



a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 28 “offsetting of assets and liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels at december 31 2021 the net maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay was 273 million other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2021 that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings

offbalance sheet arrangements 

please refer to note 26 “commitments and contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for information on offbalance sheet arrangements and the credit risk discussion in the “risk management” section for further detail on undrawn commitments 

market risk management 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

the asset and liability management policy policy on dealer trading activities and exposure limits for market risk are set by boardlevel committees and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income nii sensitivity of market value of equity mve and valueatrisk var across a range of time horizons 

treasury in the first line of defense proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities the alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite monitoring risk metrics overseeing balance sheet resources overseeing the execution of strategies and reviewing reporting such as stress test results 

market and liquidity risk management in the second line of defense provides challenge to the first line activities evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness and escalates material items for corrective action the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in northern trusts financial position eg interest income market value of equity or capital due to changes in interest rates nii and mve sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions which directly impact the mve to mitigate interest rate risk the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are sufficiently correlated which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite 

there are four commonly recognized types of structural interest rate risk in the banking book 

• repricing risk which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities 

• yield curve risk which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve 

• basis risk which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics and 

• embedded optionality risk which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

interest rate risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii and mve sensitivity nii sensitivity provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii mve sensitivity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve based on the periodend balance sheet 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

• purchase of investment securities 

• sale of investment securities that are classified as available for sale 

• issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes 

• collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank and 

• hedging with various types of derivative financial instruments 

nii sensitivity 

the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalance sheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation 

• the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered shortterm in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interestbearing treatment 

• prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions 

• cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a thirdparty vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the thirdparty mortgage analytics vendor 

• nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on northern trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategiesor judgment and 

• new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices 

the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 basis point ramp downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period 

table 48 net interest income sensitivity as of december 31 2021 



the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

mve sensitivity 

mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation 

• the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives which are based on a combination of northern trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment—some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives 

• the present values of most noninterestrelated balances such as receivables equipment and payables are the same as their book values and 

• monte carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths 

the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates 

table 49 market value of equity sensitivity as of december 31 2021 



the mve simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk mve sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trust’s balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides global foreign exchange gfx services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods the gfx trading portfolio at northern trust is composed of spot forward and nondeliverable foreign currency transactions for gfx spot risk is driven primarily by foreign exchange rate fx risk and forward risk is driven primarily by interest rate ir risk 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates and interest rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vendor software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the gfx var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical simulation monte carlo simulation and taylor approximation horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels of 95 and 99 subcomponent vars using only fx drivers and only ir drivers and lookback periods of one year two years and four years those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the following table presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for gfx in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equallyweighted volatility the total var for gfx is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents 

table 50 global foreign currency valueatrisk 



during 2021 and 2020 northern trust did not incur an actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer subsidiary northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 06 million and 11 million for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps and swaptions entered into to meet clients’ interest rate risk management needs but also including a small number of caps and floors all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by northern trusts treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities 

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished longterm earnings and capital as well as reputational damage to the firm strategic risk encompasses two main areas 

• macroeconomic and geopolitical risk centers on external events or developments that would have a detrimental impact on financial markets andor financial services firms 

• business risk arises from internal secular competitive or regulatory trends that impact northern trust’s stated strategy or its achievability 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic risk framework and governance 

the corporate strategic risk framework has been developed in conjunction with the corporation’s risk appetite and risk management policies and defines the mission and expectations of the strategic risk management function to identify and analyze the sources and consequences of strategic risk 

this is achieved through participation in the establishment and review of business line strategy coordination of risk input to the evaluation of key strategic opportunities and developing and maintaining a risk inventory and set of metrics which attempt to gauge the level of strategic risk within the organization 

in addition the strategic risk management function maintains the global event response program which aims to anticipate and prepare for stress scenarios and provide an outline for responding to them when they occur 

both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods guidelines and frameworks by which northern trust monitors and evaluates strategic risk 

climate risk 

climate risk has become a growing strategic risk for the corporation various regulatory agencies investors and other stakeholders have increased expectations and scrutiny in this area accordingly the risk management function has been taking increasing account of the impact that climate change has or may in the future have on operations credit conditions and regulatory compliance across the globe the corporation has also established a crossdisciplinary group to monitor and react to developments related to climate risk with the goal of ensuring that the organization takes it into proper account

capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to the federal reserve board’s capital plan rules which require the corporation to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review 

the major components of that oversight are the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar and doddfrank act stress tests dfast these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available 

the corporation submitted its capital plan for the federal reserve board’s 2020 ccar exercise in april 2020 and in november 2020 resubmitted the plan at the federal reserve board’s request to reflect stresses from the covid19 



pandemic on june 25 2020 the federal reserve board imposed restrictions that were designed to cause large bank holding companies to preserve capital including suspending share repurchases capping dividend payments and only allowing common stock dividends according to a formula based on recent income on december 18 2020 the federal reserve board extended a portion of these restrictions to limit share repurchases and dividend payments based on recent income these restrictions apply for the first quarter of 2021 and may be extended further

capital adequacy requirements

under the final basel iii rules the corporation with the bank is a “core” banking organization that is required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly its riskbased capital ratios the corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach to calculating riskbased capital ratios the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy 

the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios at december 31 2020 were well above the regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2020 



1 in november 2019 the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that established a deduction for central bank deposits from the total leverage exposures of custodial banking organizations including northern trust corporation and the northern trust company equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april 1 2020 

further on april 1 2020 the federal reserve issued an interim final rule that requires bank holding companies including northern trust corporation to deduct on a temporary basis deposits with the federal reserve and investments in us treasury securities from their total leverage exposure the us treasury securities deduction is applied in addition to the central bank deposits relief referred to above this rule became effective on april 1 2020 and will remain in effect through the first quarter of 2021 on may 15 2020 the us federal banking agencies released an interim final rule that permits insured depository institutions of bank holding companies also to temporarily exclude deposits with the federal reserve and investments in us treasury securities from their total leverage exposure the northern trust company did not elect to take this deduction 

the supplementary leverage ratios at december 31 2020 for the northern trust corporation and the northern trust company reflect the impact of these final rules 

advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 advanced approaches institutions that are insured depository institutions such as the bank also must maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” the corporation is also subject to a stress capital buffer which integrates forwardlooking stress test results with nonstress capital requirements and the bank is also subject to a capital conservation buffer which respectively requires the corporation and the bank to 



hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in order to avoid constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation the minimum capital buffer requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank is 25 

a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation is also a component of the capital adequacy framework in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 

as a result of the stress test results published by the federal reserve on june 25 2020 the corporation’s stress capital buffer requirement for the 2020 capital plan cycle was set at 25 the 2020 stress capital buffer became effective october 1 2020 and results in a common equity tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement of 70

basel iii also introduced the concept of a net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon the nsfr will require certain banking organizations including the corporation and the bank to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalance sheet activities the federal reserve board adopted a final rule in october 2020 implementing the nsfr and the corporation and the bank will be required to comply with the nsfr requirement on july 1 2021 

the enhanced prudential standards imposed by the doddfrank act as amended by the regulatory reform act specify certain required liquidity risk management practices for large bank holding companies and banks the federal reserve board’s october 2019 final tailoring rule targets certain aspects of these requirements based on banking organizations’ business model and risk profile as delineated into four riskbased categories the corporation a category ii institution under the final tailoring rule is subject to the liquidity risk management monthly liquidity stress testing liquidity buffer and daily liquidity reporting requirements

 item 1a  risk factors 

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients counterparties andor applicable regulators have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

covid19 pandemicrelated risks 

our business results of operations and financial condition generally have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and governmental and societal responses thereto have had a severe impact on global economic and market conditions including heightened volatility in financial markets global supply chain disruptions and the institution of social distancing and shelterinplace requirements that have resulted in temporary closures of many businesses lost revenues and increased unemployment 

these conditions have impacted—andor may in the future impact—our business results of operations and financial condition negatively including through lower net interest income resulting from lower interest rates increased provisions for credit losses lower revenue from certain of our feebased businesses impairments on the securities we hold and decreased demand for certain of our products and services additionally our liquidity and regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets volatility in foreign exchange rates deposit flows and client draws on lines of credit our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic further workfromhome and other modified business practices may introduce additional operational risks including resiliency cybersecurity and execution risks which may result in inefficiencies or delays and may affect our ability to or the manner in which we conduct our business activities 

while governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses stabilize the markets and support economic growth the ultimate success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate fully the negative impact of the ongoing pandemic further some measures may have a negative impact on our business while our participation in other measures could result in reputational harm litigation or regulatory and government actions proceedings or penalties 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact the distribution acceptance and efficacy of a vaccine and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume the ongoing pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section entitled “risk factors” and any subsequent filings with the sec 

market risks 

we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments 



resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide 

our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions for example poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients further broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products could impact our earnings negatively 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve board further reduced interest rates which generally had already been low relative to historical levels this has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding lowinterestrate environments also have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

conversely in some circumstances a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yields and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 

further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 

changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary trade and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary trade and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union remains uncertain 

the uk ceased to be a member state of the eu on january 31 2020 and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered by the uk and the eu ended on december 31 2020 in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that will apply provisionally after the end of the transition period until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement on december 30 2020 the uk passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement with the eu expected to formally adopt the agreement in early 2021 while the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu it generally does not address the regulation of financial services instead the parties adopted a declaration of their intention to agree by march 2021 upon a memorandum of understanding establishing a framework for regulatory cooperation on financial services 



consequently the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of the postbrexit relationships that remain to be negotiated between the uk and other eu nations particularly in the area of financial services brexit has contributed and may continue to contribute to market volatility particularly the valuation of the euro and british pound and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our brexitrelated preparations we have implemented certain changes to our organizational structure including the establishment of an eudomiciled credit institution in luxembourg we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur additional costs associated with such measures while unforeseen political regulatory or other developments related to brexit or operational issues associated with the organizational restructuring related thereto also may result in additional costs and disruption to our uk and eu businesses 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 

volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients’ earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues 



operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 

• failures of technological systems or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from computer viruses or cyberattacks 

• human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures 

• theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties 

• defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems 

• breakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations 

• unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades 

• defects in product design or delivery 

• difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from thirdparty vendors 

• negative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and 

• external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as pandemics geopolitical events political unrest natural disasters or acts of terrorism 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types evolve—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 

failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information resulting in the theft loss destruction gathering monitoring or other misappropriation of this information regulators globally are also introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the misappropriation of such information most states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective information security relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a 



number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm we and our clients have been and expect to continue to be subject to a wide variety of cyberattacks and threats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks and phishing attacks and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from a breach because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered in addition successful cyberattacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident 

we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to security incidents including regulatory investigations and actions further the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction with security incidents each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation 

further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses for example in the third quarter of 2020 we incurred a 434 million charge related to a corporate action processing error given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 



the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets our nonus operations accounted for 28 of our revenue in 2020 our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 



we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments money laundering and laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 

failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position 

pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism global conflicts or other similar events have in the past and may in the future have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events may still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict please see “covid19 pandemicrelated risks” in this “risk factors” section for a description of risks associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively 



the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past increased and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the method pursuant to which libor or other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

many financial markets currently rely on interbank offered rates each an “ibor” as mutually agreed upon reference rates serving as the basis for the pricing and valuation of assets trading positions loans and other financial transactions global regulators have signaled interest in replacing existing ibor rates with alternative reference rates while there are multiple ibors libor is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in the world and serves as the reference rate for our floatingrate funding certain of the products that we own or offer various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved and many derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients’ risk on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” the administrator of us dollar libor “usd libor” and other ibors announced that following required consultations i it intends to cease publication of 1week and 2month usd libor at the end of 2021 and ii subject to compliance with applicable regulations including as to representativeness it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining usd libor tenors until june 30 2023 globally financial market participants have begun to transition away from libor and other ibors to alternative reference rates and following the iba’s announcement us regulators including the federal reserve board issued statements encouraging banks to stop entering into new usd libor contracts “as soon as practicable” and by no later than december 31 2021 any change in the availability or calculation of libor or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floatingrate funding the yield on loans or securities held by us the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into the value of loans securities or derivative instruments held by us or our clients which in the case of assets held by our clients could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets the trading market for securities based on libor or other benchmarks the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively while we are working to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative interest rate benchmarks for us and our clients there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other interest rate benchmarks or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor or other interest rate benchmarks further the potential transition away from the use of libor or other interest rate benchmarks or uncertainty related to any such potential transition may cause us to recognize additional costs experience operational disruptions or result in client disputes or litigation which may negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity risks 

if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these 



regulations and other regulatory changes see “supervision and regulation—liquidity standards” in item 1 “business” any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” in item 1 “business” 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 



regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions these regulations cover a variety of matters including required capital levels prohibited activities and privacy and data protection some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the bank the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly 

various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives these initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict 

for example we are unable to predict what if any changes to the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the new us congress in conjunction with the new us presidential administration under unified party control and what the impact of any such changes will be upon our business financial condition and results of operations moreover the turnover of the us presidential administration is expected to result in certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies which are likely to impact the rulemaking supervision examination and enforcement priorities and policies of such agencies the potential impacts of which if any we cannot predict at this time 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition regulators tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing 

claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 



we may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various supervisory governmental and enforcement inquiries examinations investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with both supervisory and enforcement matters we may face limits on our ability to conduct or expand our business be required to implement corrective actions that increase the costs of conducting business or become subject to civil or criminal penalties or other remedial sanctions any of which could result in reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on us 

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap the process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate 

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 

strategic risks 

if we do not execute strategic plans successfully we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

if we are not able to attract retain and motivate key personnel our business could be negatively affected 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely 



we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations operational failures litigation regulatory actions or fines the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates vendors or other third parties with which we do business the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could materially and adversely affect our reputation as well as our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 

we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current “fintech” environment in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective 



responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 

our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 

our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the federal reserve board on june 25 2020 the federal reserve board 



imposed restrictions that were designed to cause large bank holding companies to preserve capital including suspending share repurchases capping dividend payments and only allowing common stock dividends according to a formula based on recent income on december 18 2020 the federal reserve board extended a portion of these restrictions to limit share repurchases and dividend payments based on recent income these restrictions will apply for the first quarter of 2021 and may be extended further 

a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 

our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock and series e noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series e preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt or elect to defer interest payments on our floating rate capital debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” and “supervision and regulation—capital planning and stress testing” in item 1 “business”

net interest income 

net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds adjusted for the impact of interestrelated hedging activity earning assets — including federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell interestbearing due from and deposits with banks federal reserve and other central bank deposits and other securities and loans and leases — are financed by a large base of interestbearing funds that include client deposits shortterm borrowings senior notes and longterm debt shortterm borrowings include federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings earning assets also are funded by noninterestrelated funds which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interestbearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates in addition the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income 

net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interestearning assets 

net interest income stated on an fte basis is a nongaap financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes when adjusted to an fte basis yields on taxable nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable however the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided on page 85

note changes not due solely to average balance changes or rate changes are allocated proportionately to average balance and rate based on their relative absolute magnitudes 

net interest income in 2020 decreased from 2019 net interest income stated on an fte basis decreased from 2019 due to a lower net interest margin partially offset by higher levels of average earning assets average earning assets increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily reflecting higher levels of shortterm interest bearing deposits securities and loans and leases funding of the balance sheet reflected higher levels of client deposits the increase in average client deposits resulted from the large inflows experienced at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and these balances were largely maintained throughout the year 

the net interest margin in 2020 decreased from 2019 the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates low levels of market interest rates are expected to continue to impact our net interest income

the allowance for credit losses — which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk offbalance sheet credit exposure and specific borrower relationships — is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process northern trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis a financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption in determining an appropriate allowance level management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates and takes into consideration past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trust’s credit loss reserve committee which receives input from credit risk management treasury corporate finance the economic research group and each of northern trust’s business units the allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit debt securities held to maturity and other financial assets was 1907 million 611 million 73 million and 08 million respectively as of december 31 2020 for additional information relating to the allowance for credit losses and the changes in the allowance for credit losses during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 due to chargeoffs 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

recoveries and provisions for credit losses refer to note 7 “allowance for credit losses” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the following table shows the net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans and leases by segment and class at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

table 39 net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans and leases 



net recoveries chargeoffs for the following segments were zero and therefore excluded from the above table as the ratio of net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans and leases is also zero lease financing net other and nonus the average loans and leases balances were also not provided in the table for lease financing net other and nonus 

total average loans and leases for all loan portfolio categories were 335 billion 311 billion and 320 billion for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the sec requires the disclosure of the allowance for credit losses that is applicable to international operations the disclosure has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining nonus operating performance the amounts disclosed should not be construed as being the only amounts that are available for nonus loan chargeoffs since the entire allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both us and nonus loans in addition these amounts are not intended to be indicative of future chargeoff trends please refer to the following table for the nonus allowance balances 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following table shows the allowance evaluated on an individual and collective basis for the loans and leases portfolio by segment and class at december 31 2020 and 2019 

table 40 allocation of the allowance for credit losses 



allowance related to credit exposure evaluated on an individual basis the allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans leases and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

the allowance evaluated on an individual basis for loans and leases increased 38 million from 69 million at december 31 2019 to 107 million at december 31 2020 primarily attributable to outstanding loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio partially offset by a decrease in outstanding loans in the residential real estate portfolio 

allowance related to credit exposure evaluated on a collective basis expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics if financial assets are deemed to not share similar risk characteristics an individual assessment is warranted 

the allowance evaluated on a collective basis for loans and leases increased 1236 million to 2411 million at december 31 2020 compared with 1175 million at december 31 2019 under the previous “incurred loss” model primarily driven by current and projected economic conditions and downgrades in the portfolio both resulting from the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related market and economic impacts the largest increases were in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios 

overall allowance the evaluation of the reserve evaluated on an individual and collective basis resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 2599 million at december 31 2020 compared with 1244 million at the end of 2019 under the previous “incurred loss” model the allowance of 1907 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 056 at december 31 2020 which increased from a 1045 million allowance assigned to loans and leases representing 033 of total loans and leases at december 31 2019 allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 611 million and 199 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

nonus outstandings 

as used in this discussion nonus outstandings are crossborder outstandings as defined by the sec they consist of loans securities interestbearing deposits with financial institutions accrued interest and other monetary assets not included are letters of credit loan commitments and nonus office local currency claims on residents nonus outstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of tangible liquid collateral realizable outside the country however transactions with branches of nonus banks are included in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the nonus bank’s head office 

shortterm interbank time deposits with nonus banks represent the largest category of nonus outstandings northern trust actively participates in the interbank market with us and nonus banks 

northern trust places deposits with nonus counterparties that have strong internal northern trust risk ratings and external credit ratings these nonus banks are approved and monitored by northern trust’s capital markets credit committee which has credit authority for exposure to all nonus banks and approves credit limits this process includes financial analysis of the nonus banks use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or general market conditions separate from the entityspecific review process the average life to maturity of deposits with nonus banks is deliberately maintained on a shortterm basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions northern trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of collateral andor balance sheet netting additionally the capital markets credit committee oversees countryrisk analyses and imposes limits on country exposure for additional information refer to note 32 “reporting segments and related information” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

capital management 

one of northern trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients counterparties creditors regulators and stockholders a strong capital position helps northern trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments 

senior management with oversight from the capital governance committee and the full board of directors is responsible for capital management and planning northern trust manages its capital on both a total corporation basis and a legal entity basis the capital committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the capital policy approved by the capital governance committee of the board of directors in establishing the metrics related to capital a variety of factors are taken into consideration including the unique risk profiles of northern trust’s businesses regulatory requirements capital levels relative to peers and the impact on credit ratings 

capital levels strengthened in 2020 as average stockholders’ equity increased 5442 million or 5 reaching 112 billion total stockholders’ equity was 117 billion at december 31 2020 as compared to 111 billion at december 31 2019 during 2019 the corporation issued and sold 16 million depositary shares each representing 11000th ownership interest in a share of series e noncumulative perpetual preferred stock for proceeds of 3914 million net of underwriting discounts commissions and other issuance costs these proceeds were subsequently used to fund the redemption of all outstanding shares of the corporation’s series c noncumulative perpetual preferred stock on january 2 2020 at a redemption price of 4000 million which was 115 million in excess of the net carrying value of the shares the 115 million excess is included in preferred stock dividends in the determination of net income available to common shareholders preferred dividends totaling 447 million were declared in 2020 during 2020 the corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend of 070 per common share common dividends totaling 5920 million were declared in 2020 during the year ended december 31 2020 the corporation repurchased 33 million shares of common stock including 05 million shares withheld related to sharebased compensation at an average price per share of 9149

in accordance with basel iii requirements capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches for each ratio the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy the following table provides a reconciliation of the corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total riskbased capital and its riskbased capital ratios under the applicable us regulatory rules as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

table 44 capital adequacy 



1 riskweighted assets exclude as applicable under each regulatory approach amounts primarily related to goodwill certain other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from tier 1 and tier 2 capital if any 

2 adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities 

3 in november 2019 the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that established a deduction for central bank deposits from the total leverage exposures of custodial banking organizations including northern trust corporation and the northern trust company equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april 1 2020 

further on april 1 2020 the federal reserve issued an interim final rule that requires bank holding companies including northern trust corporation to deduct on a temporary basis deposits with the federal reserve and investments in us treasury securities from their total leverage exposure the us treasury securities deduction is applied in addition to the central bank deposits relief referred to above this rule became effective on april 1 2020 and will remain in effect through the first quarter of 2021 on may 15 2020 the us federal banking agencies released an interim final rule that permits insured depository institutions of bank holding companies also to temporarily exclude deposits with the federal reserve and investments in us treasury securities from their total leverage exposure the northern trust company did not elect to take this deduction 

the supplementary leverage ratios at december 31 2020 for the northern trust corporation and the northern trust company reflect the impact of these final rules 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” under applicable us regulatory requirements as a result of the stress test results published by the federal reserve on june 25 2020 northern trust’s stress capital buffer requirement for the 2020 capital plan cycle was set at 25 the 2020 stress capital buffer became effective october 1 2020 and results in a common equity tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement of 70 

further information regarding the corporation’s and the bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” is provided in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 “business” and note 33 “regulatory capital requirements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2020 the basel iii regulatory capital items subject to phasein and phaseout are not material to regulatory capital ratios 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

commitments letters of credit and securities lent with indemnification 

northern trust in the normal course of business enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be drawn fully upon and the client default to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit northern trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities 

at december 31 2020 legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled 2523 million and 45 million respectively at december 31 2019 legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled 3016 million and 92 million respectively 

additional information about northern trust’s offbalance sheet financial instruments is included in note 26 “commitments and contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

variable interest entities 

variable interest entities vies are defined within gaap as entities which either 1 lack sufficient equity at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 2 have equity investors that lack attributes typical of an equity investor such as the ability to make significant decisions through voting rights affecting the entity’s operations or the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity or 3 are structured with voting rights that are disproportionate to the equity investor’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive returns and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of the holder of the equity investment at risk with disproportionately few voting rights investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder if any that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and through its variable interest the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vie’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 

additional information about northern trust’s vies is included in note 29 “variable interest entities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for credit losses 

the corporation adopted accounting standards update asu no 201613 “financial instruments—credit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” asu 201613 on january 1 2020 which significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments upon adoption of asu 201613 the corporation recorded a 137 million increase in the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings 101 million net of income taxes for more information on the adoption of asu 201613 please refer to note 2 “recent accounting pronouncements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the allowance for credit losses — which represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk offbalance sheet credit exposure and specific borrower relationships — is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process northern trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis a financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption in determining an appropriate allowance level management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates and takes into consideration past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2020 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

evaluated on a collective basis expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics if financial assets are deemed to not share similar risk characteristics an individual assessment is warranted 

the allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is primarily based on internal loss data specific to the northern trust financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments based on loan and obligorspecific factors including loan type borrower type collateral type loan size and borrower credit quality for each segment the probability of default and loss given default are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument for the first two years the reasonable and supportable period these factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar factors for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period northern trust reverts to its longrun historical loss experiences on a straightline basis over four quarters the exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balances as of each quarterend with adjustments made for potential drawdowns of revolving lines 

for each of the different parameters specific credit models for the individual loan segments were developed for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance the quantitative allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework through which management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio 

asu 201613 requires the use of projected macroeconomic factors northern trust’s current projection period is eight quarters with a fourquarter straightline reversion period to historical average loss rates the corporation uses multiple forecasts which are approved by northern trust’s macroeconomic scenario development committee msdc the baseline forecast aligns with the corporation’s latest thinking on macroeconomic projections for the next eight quarters the forecasts are weighted at each evaluation period and are management’s best estimate of future economic projections at that time 

the allowance estimate is sensitive to changes in portfolio composition and quality and macroeconomic forecasts increases in the amount of borrowing and material downgrades to the quality of the lending portfolio will increase the reserve all else equal similarly deteriorating projections for macroeconomic conditions will increase the reserve macroeconomic factors that are particularly correlated to northern trust’s loan and lease portfolio are equity market values market volatility corporate profits house and commercial real estate price indices unemployment and disposable income the investment security and other financial assets exposure portfolios are less sensitive to macroeconomic factors in terms of overall reserve impact due to factors such as high credit quality short duration and low historical losses 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trust’s credit loss reserve committee which receives input from credit risk management treasury corporate finance the economic research group and each of northern trust’s business units the credit loss reserve committee determines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by msdc and also reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with northern trust’s qualitative adjustment framework 

evaluated on an individual basis the allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of financial assets considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans for which the amount of allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

the quarterly analysis of the individual and collective allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees us qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan us nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the average remaining service period of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us pension plans in 2020 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 337 for both the us qualified plan and the us nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 900 to 250 that averaged 497 the expected longterm rate of return on us qualified plan assets was 525 

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us pension plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2020 measurement date the following were considered 

• discount rate northern trust estimates the discount rate for its us pension plans by applying the plan specific projected cash flows for future benefit payments for each plan to the aon aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date this yield curve is composed of individual zerocoupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99year time horizon zerocoupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aarated corporate bonds this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 275 and 245 at december 31 2020 for the us qualified and us nonqualified plans respectively 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

• compensation level based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from 900 to 250 that averages 497 

• rate of return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the longterm 30 years rate of return on plan assets which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness as a result of these analyses northern trust’s rate of return assumption for the us qualified plan remains at 525 for 2021 

• mortality table as of december 31 2020 northern trust has adopted the aggregate pri2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2019 northern trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale mp2020 which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2020 this assumption was updated at december 31 2020 from improvement scale mp2019 the updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in slightly lower projected mortality improvement rates than estimated by the mp2019 improvement scale mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the irs prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2021 

net pension expense in 2021 is expected to increase slightly by approximately 12 million primarily driven by the decrease in discount rates in 2020 

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected us pension plans’ periodic pension expense in 2021 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 45 sensitivity of us pension plans assumptions 



pension contributions the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 there were no contributions to the us qualified plan for the 2020 plan year the minimum required contribution to the us qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2021 the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 2550 million for 2021 

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2020 approximately 25 of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1 of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 7 of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 93 of northern trust’s assets and 98 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment debt 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

securities classified as available for sale make up 97 of level 2 assets with the remaining 3 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2020 all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 95 measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2020 northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million and 10 million shares of visa inc class b common stock visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 26 “commitments and contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities including overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

physical and financial collateral northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies 

netting onbalance sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting agreements netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits

the corporation’s liquidity defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets was 25 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively during and at yearend 2020 and 2019 these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries as needed average liquidity during 2020 and 2019 was 27 billion and 20 billion respectively the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 34 “northern trust corporation corporation only” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

uses of liquidity 

liquidity supports a variety of activities including client withdrawals purchases of securities net loan growth and draws on commitments to extend credit 

the corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation’s stockholders the payment of principal and interest to note holders repurchases of its common stock and investments in or loans to its subsidiaries the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2020 were 5846 million of common stock dividends and 2998 million of common stock repurchases 

credit ratings 

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2020 provided in the following table allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table 48 northern trust credit ratings as of december 31 2020 



a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 28 “offsetting of assets and liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels at december 31 2020 the net maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay was 6042 million other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2020 that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings

market risk management 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk associated with the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and trading risk interest rate risk associated with the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

the asset and liability management policy policy on dealer trading activities and exposure limits for market risk are set by boardlevel committees and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income nii sensitivity of market value of equity mve and valueatrisk var across a range of time horizons 

treasury in the first line of defense proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities the alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite monitoring risk metrics overseeing balance sheet resources overseeing the execution of strategies and reviewing reporting such as stress test results 

market and liquidity risk management in the second line of defense provides challenge to the first line activities evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness and escalates material items for corrective action the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk associated with the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet is the potential for deterioration in northern trusts financial position eg interest income market value of equity or capital due to changes in interest rates nii and mve sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions which directly impact the mve to mitigate interest rate risk the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are sufficiently correlated which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite 

there are four commonly recognized types of structural interest rate risk associated with the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 

• repricing risk which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities 

• yield curve risk which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve 

• basis risk which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics and 

• embedded optionality risk which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes 

interest rate risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii and mve sensitivity nii sensitivity provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii mve sensitivity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve based on the periodend balance sheet 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

• purchase of investment securities 

• sale of investment securities that are classified as available for sale 

• issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes 

• collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank and 

• hedging with various types of derivative financial instruments 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nii sensitivity 

the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalance sheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation 

• the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered shortterm in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interestbearing treatment 

• prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions 

• cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a thirdparty vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the thirdparty mortgage analytics vendor 

• nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on northern trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategiesor judgment and 

• new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices 

the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 basis point ramp downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period 

table 50 net interest income sensitivity as of december 31 2020 



the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

mve sensitivity 

mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

• the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives which are based on a combination of northern trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment—some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives 

• the present values of most noninterestrelated balances such as receivables equipment and payables are the same as their book values and 

• monte carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths 

the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates 

table 51 market value of equity sensitivity as of december 31 2020 



the mve simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk mve sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trust’s balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides global foreign exchange gfx services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods the gfx trading portfolio at northern trust is composed of spot forward and nondeliverable foreign currency transactions for gfx spot risk is driven primarily by foreign exchange rate fx risk and forward risk is driven primarily by interest rate ir risk 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vendor software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the gfx var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical simulation monte carlo simulation and taylor approximation horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels of 95 and 99 subcomponent vars using only fx drivers and only ir drivers and lookback periods of one year two years and four years those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the following table presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for gfx in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equallyweighted volatility the total var for gfx is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents 

table 52 global foreign currency valueatrisk 



during 2020 northern trust did not incur an actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate during 2019 northern trust experienced one day of actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer subsidiary northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 11 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps and swaptions entered into to meet clients’ interest rate risk management needs but also including a small number of caps and floors all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by northern trusts treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities 

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished longterm earnings and capital as well as reputational damage to the firm strategic risk encompasses two main areas 

• macroeconomic and geopolitical risk centers on external events or developments that would have a detrimental impact on financial markets andor financial services firms 

• business risk arises from internal secular competitive or regulatory trends that impact northern trust’s stated strategy or its achievability 

strategic risk framework and governance 

the corporate strategic risk framework has been developed in conjunction with the corporation’s risk appetite and risk management policies and defines the mission and expectations of the strategic risk management function to identify and analyze the sources and consequences of strategic risk 

this is achieved through participation in the establishment and review of business line strategy coordination of risk input to the evaluation of key strategic opportunities and developing and maintaining a risk inventory and set of metrics which attempt to gauge the level of strategic risk within the organization 

in addition the strategic risk management function maintains the global event response program which aims to anticipate and prepare for stress scenarios and provide an outline for responding to them when they occur 

both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods guidelines and frameworks by which northern trust monitors and evaluates strategic risk

the doddfrank act as amended 

in may 2018 the us congress passed and the president signed the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the regulatory relief act which amended parts of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act and directed the federal reserve board and other federal regulators to revise parts of their regulations that implement the doddfrank act in october 2019 the federal reserve board and other federal regulators finalized the revisions required by the regulatory relief act the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act as implemented through final rules promulgated by the federal reserve board and other agencies and amended by the regulatory relief act most relevant to the corporation and its subsidiaries including the bank 

enhanced prudential standards the doddfrank act as implemented by the federal reserve board through various rulemakings and amended by the regulatory relief act generally imposes enhanced prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the enhanced prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures 

in october 2019 the federal reserve board finalized a proposed rule implementing changes made by the regulatory relief act this rule introduced a new fourcategory framework to determine which enhanced prudential standards and other requirements are applicable to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least 100 billion based on asset thresholds and other riskbased factors under the new rules the corporation is classified as a category ii institution 

the requirements under the new framework that apply to the corporation are largely unchanged as a result of the federal reserve board’s final tailoring rule for enhanced prudential standards the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board conduct supervisory and internal periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions maintain enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework discussed below in “liquidity standards” and aggregate credit exposure limits conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event the corporation is not subject to the total lossabsorbing capacity requirement capital surcharge enhanced supplementary leverage ratio or aggregate credit exposure limit that apply to us bank holding companies that are global systemically important bank holding companies 

resolution planning as required by section 165d of the doddfrank act the corporation is required to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition under an fdic rule the cidi resolution plan rule the bank must submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of its failure the corporation is required to submit its next section 165d resolution plan by july 1 2021 the fdic has indicated that the bank is not required to submit a resolution plan under the cidi resolution plan rule before the conclusion of a rulemaking regarding the cidi resolution plan rule requirements 

on march 24 2017 the federal reserve board and the fdic provided joint written feedback to the corporation regarding the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 pursuant to section 165d of the doddfrank act the 2015 165d plan the joint written feedback identified certain “shortcomings” in the corporation’s 2015 165d plan while the identification of these shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not “credible” the corporation was required to address the shortcomings in a satisfactory manner in the corporation’s resolution plan submitted to the federal reserve board and the fdic in december 2017 the 2017 165d plan on march 29 2019 the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly announced that they did not identify shortcomings or deficiencies in the 2017 165d plan 

in addition on june 27 2018 the bank submitted its resolution plan the 2018 cidi plan to the fdic under the cidi resolution plan rule to date no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the 2018 cidi plan 

separately the european union bank recovery and resolution directive brrd was adopted for european union credit institutions including certain of the bank’s subsidiaries and branches effective january 1 2015 in accordance with applicable commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf guidance a simplified recovery plan for northern trust global services se a luxembourgregistered indirect subsidiary of the bank has been established and will be reviewed and filed with the cssf at least biennially cssf regulations also require institutions to submit resolution related data on an annual basis a requirement for which northern trust global services se has an established process 

orderly liquidation authority under the doddfrank act certain financial companies such as the corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority if in default or danger of default and their resolution under the us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states 



among other requirements set by statute if the corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority the fdic would be appointed as its receiver which would give the fdic considerable powers to resolve the corporation absent such actions the corporation as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code 

the volcker rule  the volcker rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for marketmaking hedging certain trading activities in us and foreign sovereign debt certain trading activities of nonus banking entities trading outside the united states certain customerdriven matched swaps and trading activities related to liquidity management the volcker rule also imposes significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds” such as hedge funds or private equity funds again subject to exceptions northern trust maintains an enterprisewide compliance program to comply with the volcker rule 

swaps and other derivatives the doddfrank act imposed a regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin trade reporting and recordkeeping the doddfrank act also requires certain entities to register as a “major swap participant” a “swap dealer” a “majorsecuritybased swap participant” or a “securitybased swap dealer” the bank’s activities as a swap dealer are subject to the cftc’s rules and regulations including rules regarding internal and external business conduct standards reporting and recordkeeping mandatory clearing for certain swaps trade documentation and confirmation requirements and crossborder swap activities the bank is also subject to federal reserve board regulations regarding mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap counterparties the sec’s rules related to securitybased swaps are not currently applicable to the bank’s swapdealing activity and the bank’s current trading activity does not mandate its regulation as a securitybased swap dealer 

holding company support under the federal deposit insurance act 

the doddfrank act amended the federal deposit insurance act fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies such as the corporation to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress 

payment of dividends 

the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed without objection by the federal reserve board dividends from the bank are a significant source of funds for the corporation and the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends on the ability of the bank to pay sufficient dividends to the corporation 

various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank to the corporation without regulatory consent the bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized in general the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar year is limited to its “recent earnings” the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years or its “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus whichever is less the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation may also be affected by the capital adequacy standards applicable to the bank discussed further below which include minimum requirements and buffers 

capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to the federal reserve board’s capital plan rules which require the corporation to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan to which the federal reserve board has not objected 

the major components of that oversight are the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar and doddfrank act stress tests dfast these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available 

the corporation submitted its most recent capital plan to the federal reserve board in april 2019 as part of the federal reserve board’s 2019 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporation’s plan and proposed capital actions including authority to increase its dividend payments and share repurchases in mid2019 

the regulatory relief act and the federal reserve board’s tailoring rule implementing changes required by such act did not directly affect the ccar exercise or capital plan requirements that apply to the corporation the corporation remains subject to annual companyrun stress testing annual supervisory stress testing and annual capital plan submission requirements 



the corporation will submit its 2020 capital plan to the federal reserve board by april 6 2020 the federal reserve board is expected to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2020 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases in mid2020 

under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on june 21 2019 and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on october 31 2019 

in april 2018 the federal reserve board proposed revisions to the ccar exercise and dfast regulations that would in part integrate the forwardlooking stress test results with the nonstress capital requirements discussed below by using the results of the annual supervisory stress test to set specific buffer requirements above minimum capital requirements which restrict capital distributions under the capital rule and establish a single approach to capital distribution limitations the april 2018 proposal also would replace the 25 capital conservation buffer requirement discussed below with a stress capital buffer requirement and establish a stress leverage buffer requirement in addition to the minimum 4 tier 1 leverage ratio requirement under the april 2018 proposal an institution would be required to maintain capital ratios above its minimum plus its buffer requirements in order to avoid restrictions on its capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments an institution would be bound by the most stringent distribution limitations if any as determined by its capital conservation buffer requirement its stress leverage buffer requirement and if applicable its advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard 

the april 2018 proposal also would remove the stress testing assumption that an institution would make all planned capital distributions over the planning horizon including any planned common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock instead the stress buffer requirements would include only four quarters of planned common stock dividends in order to preserve the incentives for an institution to engage in disciplined forwardlooking dividend planning further the april 2018 proposal would adjust the methodology used in the supervisory stress test to assume that the institution takes actions to maintain a constant level of assets including loans trading assets and securities over the planning horizon and assume that the institution’s riskweighted assets and leverage ratio denominator generally remain unchanged over the planning horizon the april 2018 proposal also would remove the quantitative objection in ccar and eliminate the 30 percent dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of an institutions capital plan the federal reserve board would retain the ccar qualitative supervisory review and the ability to object to an institution’s capital plan on qualitative grounds based on the adequacy of the institution’s capital planning processes for institutions supervised by the large institution supervision coordination committee and other large and complex institutions 

as of the date of this filing the federal reserve board has not finalized the april 2018 proposal and the corporation cannot predict whether it will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the ccar exercise and dfast regulations are applied to the corporation 

capital adequacy requirements 

the corporation as a bank holding company is subject to riskbased and leverage capital guidelines implemented by the federal reserve board that are based on industrystandard guidelines published by the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee known as basel iii the bank as an fdicinsured depository institution is also required to meet riskbased and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation with the bank is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations that are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios the corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach to calculating riskbased capital ratios the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy 



the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios at december 31 2019  were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2019 



advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 advanced approaches institutions that are insured depository institutions such as the bank also must maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” the corporation and bank are also subject to a capital conservation buffer which requires them to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in order to avoid constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation the minimum capital conservation buffer increased to 25 in 2019 from 1875 in 2018 

a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation is also a component of the capital adequacy framework in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 but certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0 which slightly increase the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subject 

as discussed above in april 2018 the federal reserve board proposed revisions to the basel iii rules that would in part integrate the forwardlooking stress test results with the nonstress capital requirements discussed in this section if implemented the revisions would establish revised capital requirements for large banking organizations such as the corporation that are institutionspecific and risksensitive 

liquidity standards 

northern trust is subject to the us liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement which is designed to ensure that covered banking organizations including the corporation and the bank maintain an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to their expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon under a regulatorily prescribed liquidity stress scenario as of december 31 2019  the corporation and the bank were in compliance with applicable lcr requirements 

basel iii also introduced the concept of a net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon the nsfr will require certain banking organizations including the corporation to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities the federal reserve board has proposed but has not adopted a final rule implementing the nsfr 

the enhanced prudential standards imposed by the doddfrank act as amended by the regulatory reform act specify certain required liquidity risk management practices for large bank holding companies and banks the federal reserve board’s october 2019 final tailoring rule targets certain aspects of these requirements based on banking organizations’ business model and risk profile as delineated into four riskbased categories the corporation a category ii institution under the final tailoring rule is subject to the liquidity risk management monthly liquidity stress testing liquidity buffer and daily liquidity reporting requirements 



prompt corrective action 

federal banking regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards and are also authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation could be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan for the bank if it were undercapitalized 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates

various legal requirements prohibit northern trust entities from engaging in business in or with certain jurisdictions and parties such as organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control publishes lists of these prohibited parties known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction or account the corporation or the bank must reject or block such account or transaction and notify the appropriate authorities 

failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals restrictions on their business activities or harm to reputation many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations

 item 1a  risk factors 

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k 

market risks 

we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide 

our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions for example poor investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide that is due to underperformance relative to our competitors or benchmarks could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients further broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products could impact our earnings negatively 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings interest rates generally remain low relative to historical levels low interest rate environments have had in the past and may have in the future a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding low interest rate environments also have historically had a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example in the past we have from time to time waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to shortterm interest rate levels and we may do so in the future if shortterm interest rate levels decline low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

conversely in some circumstances a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yields and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 



further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 

changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary trade and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary trade and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union remains uncertain 

in june 2016 united kingdom uk voters approved a departure from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” following delivery of the uk’s formal notice of withdrawal in march 2017 a subsequent negotiation period and approval of a withdrawal agreement by each of the uk and the eu the uk formally exited the eu on january 31 2020 the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the final terms of the postbrexit relationships negotiated between the uk and other eu nations brexit has contributed and may continue to contribute to market volatility particularly the valuation of the euro and british pound and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our brexitrelated preparations and to mitigate the potential risk that our uk subsidiaries will be unable to retain their eu financial services “passports” we have implemented certain changes to our organizational structure including the establishment of an eudomiciled credit institution in luxembourg we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur additional costs associated with such measures and unforeseen political regulatory or other developments related to brexit or operational issues associated with the organizational restructuring related thereto also may result in additional costs and disruption to our eu banking business 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 



volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues 

operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 

 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 



failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information resulting in theft loss or other misappropriation of this information regulators globally are also introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the theft loss or other misappropriation of such information most states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches for example the general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal information noncompliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in the united states the california consumer privacy act ccpa was adopted by the state of california and became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa substantially increases the rights of california residents to understand how their personal data is collected and used by commercial businesses and includes a private right of action permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state attorney general or other government actor for breaches these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective information security relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered in addition a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident 

we expect to continue to face a wide variety of cyberthreats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients’ or other parties’ confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the 



effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation 

further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are 

inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 



a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 31 of our revenue in 2019  our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments money laundering and laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 



failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position in october 2017 we announced our “value for spend” expense management initiative with the goal of realizing 250 million in expense runrate savings by 2020 through improved organizational alignment process optimization and strategic sourcing although we have made substantial progress toward achieving this goal we cannot predict its overall effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future 

acts of terrorism natural disasters global climate change pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters global climate change pandemics global conflicts or other similar events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively 



the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the method pursuant to which the london interbank offered rate libor or other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

many financial markets currently rely on interbank offered rates each an ibor as mutually agreed upon reference rates serving as the basis for the pricing and valuation of assets trading positions loans and other financial transactions following historical concerns about attempted manipulation of ibor levels as well as a potential lack of liquidity in the underlying activity that contributes to an ibor setting global regulators have signaled interest in replacing existing ibor rates with alternative reference rates while there are multiple ibors libor is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in the world and serves as the reference rate for our floatingrate funding certain of the products that we own or offer various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved and many derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients’ risk in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates the process for establishing libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 and as a result the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 any change in the availability or calculation of libor or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floatingrate funding the yield on loans or securities held by us the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into the value of loans securities or derivative instruments held by us or our clients which in the case of assets held by our clients could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets the trading market for securities based on libor or other benchmarks the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively while we are working to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative interest rate benchmarks for us and our clients there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other interest rate benchmarks or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor or other interest rate benchmarks further the potential transition away from the use of libor or other interest rate benchmarks or uncertainty related to any such potential transition may cause us to recognize additional costs or experience operational disruptions which may negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity risks 

if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes see “supervision and regulation—liquidity standards” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 



if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 



regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally and subject to evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly 

various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives these initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 

we may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us 



we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap the process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate 

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 

strategic risks 

if we do not execute strategic plans successfully we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

if we are not able to attract retain and motivate key personnel our business could be negatively affected 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely 

we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those 



applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations operational failures litigation regulatory actions or fines the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates vendors or other third parties with which we do business the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could materially and adversely affect our reputation as well as our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 

we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current “fintech” environment in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 



our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act hr 1 tcja was signed into law the tcja introduced a number of changes in thenexisting tax law impacting businesses including among other things a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 disallowance of certain deductions that had previously been allowed limitations on interest deductions alteration of the expensing of capital expenditures adoption of a territorial tax system assessment of a onetime repatriation tax or “tollcharge” on undistributed earnings and profits of usowned foreign corporations and introduction of certain antibase erosion provisions the ultimate impact of the tcja on our financial condition and results of operations in future years remains uncertain and may differ materially from our expectations due to the anticipated issuance of technical guidance regarding certain elements of the tcja including elements impacting the us taxes payable on the income of the corporation’s nonus branches changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made with respect to the tcja and changes to the competitive landscape in which we operate and other factors 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 



our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected there can be no assurance that the federal reserve board will not object to our future capital plans in addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders an objection by the federal reserve board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us 

a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 

our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock and series e noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series e preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt or elect to defer interest payments on our floating rate capital debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock

net interest income stated on an fte basis is a nongaap financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes when adjusted to an fte basis yields on taxable nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable however the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided on page 89

provision for income taxes 

provisions for income tax and effective tax rates are impacted by levels of pretax income as well as nonrecurring items such as the resolution of tax matters and changes in income tax rates and tax laws the 2019 provision for income taxes was 4519 million  representing an effective rate of 232  this compares with a provision for income taxes of 4014 million and an effective rate of 205 in 2018  

the increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to higher us taxes payable on the income of the corporations nonus branches in 2019 as well as income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the timing of tax deductions for software developmentrelated expenses and the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 

the tcja was enacted on december 22 2017 and reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21  it also required companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred at december 31 2017 northern trust made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the tcja during 2018 northern trust completed the related calculations and additional analyses associated with the implementation of the tcja resulting in a number of adjustments to the 2018 tax provision as follows 

table 18 impact of tax cuts and jobs act 

adjustments in the above table included a tax benefit of 168 million resulting from an adjustment to the corporation’s 2017 income tax provision for mandatory deemed repatriation with respect to the pre2018 earnings of its nonus subsidiaries offset by a 127 million net provision recorded associated with the repricing of deferred taxes 

as a result of the tcja earnings which had been reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states were deemed to have been repatriated to the united states and were subject to a repatriation tax as of december 31 2018  northern trust’s repatriation tax was 1332 million

reporting segment financial information presented on an internal managementreporting basis is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment and incorporates processes for allocating assets liabilities equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing ftp methodology under the methodology assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk liquidity risk and other product characteristics on an instrument level equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including but not limited to risk regulatory considerations and internal metrics allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities the accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments northern trusts presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions 

effective january 1 2019 northern trust implemented several enhancements to its ftp methodology including the allocation of contingent liquidity charges to cis and wealth management client instruments and products these methodology enhancements affect the results of each reporting segment due to the lack of historical information segment results for periods ended prior to january 1 2019 have not been revised to reflect the methodology enhancements 

also effective january 1 2019 all revenues expenses and average assets are allocated to cis and wealth management with the exception of nonrecurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions divestitures litigation restructuring and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

allowance and provision for credit losses 

during 2017 the corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes the allowance for credit losses as of and prior to december 31 2016 remains unadjusted as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial 

table 38 analysis of allowance for credit losses 





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships specific loss component and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit inherent loss component 

the sec requires the disclosure of the allowance for credit losses that is applicable to international operations the disclosure has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining nonus operating performance the amounts disclosed should not be construed as being the only amounts that are available for nonus loan chargeoffs since the entire allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both us and nonus loans in addition these amounts are not intended to be indicative of future chargeoff trends there was no allowance for credit losses relating to nonus operations for years 2016 through 2019 for 2015 there was a 33 million allowance for credit losses at the beginning of the year a credit provision of 33 million during the year and no allowance for credit losses as of december 31 2015 

the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31 2019  and at each of the prior four yearends 

table 39 allocation of the allowance for credit losses 





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

specific component of the allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired taking into consideration expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

the specific allowance component decreased 31 million from 100 million at december 31 2018 to 69 million at december 31 2019  primarily attributable to standby letters of credit and outstanding loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio and outstanding loans in the residential real estate portfolios 

inherent component of the allowance the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans 

the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 107 million to 1175 million at december 31 2019  compared with 1282 million at december 31 2018  primarily due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality within the residential real estate portfolio partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality 

overall allowance the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 1244 million at december 31 2019  compared with 1382 million at the end of 2018  the allowance of 1045 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 033 at december 31 2019  which decreased from a 1126 million allowance assigned to loans and leases representing 035 of total loans and leases at december 31 2018  allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 199 million and 256 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

provision the provision for credit losses was a credit provision of 145 million and net recoveries totaled 07 million in 2019  this compares with a credit provision of 145 million and net chargeoffs of 11 million in 2018  

impaired loans 

a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2019  impaired loans totaled 922 million and included 826 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 1162 million at december 31 2018  which included 998 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 50 million and 72 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2019  and 2018  respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1 million as of december 31 2019  homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2019  provided below allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 

table 48 northern trust credit ratings as of december 31 2019 



a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 28 “offsetting of assets and liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels at december 31 2019  the net maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay was 4391 million  other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2019  that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with basel iii requirements capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches for each ratio the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy the following table provides a reconciliation of the corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total riskbased capital and its riskbased capital ratios under the applicable us regulatory rules as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

table 50 capital adequacy 



1 riskweighted assets exclude as applicable under each regulatory approach amounts primarily related to goodwill certain other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from tier 1 and tier 2 capital if any 

2 adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities 

3 effective january 1 2018 the corporation and bank are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” under applicable us regulatory requirements further information regarding the corporation’s and the bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” is provided in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 “business” and note 34 “regulatory capital requirements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

specific allowance the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired taking into consideration expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

inherent allowance the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments based on loan type loan size and borrower rating for each segment the probability of default over a loss emergence period and a loss given default are derived from the historical data and applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate finance 

the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2019 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees us qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan us nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us pension plans in 2019  northern trust utilized a discount rate of 447 for both the us qualified plan and the us nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 900 to 250 that averaged 439  the expected longterm rate of return on us qualified plan assets was 600  

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us pension plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2019 measurement date the following were considered 

 

net pension expense in 2020 is expected to increase by approximately 306 million  primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate and expected rate of return 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected us pension plans’ periodic pension expense in 2020 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019  the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 53 sensitivity of us pension plans assumptions 



pension contributions the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 there were no contributions to the us qualified plan for the 2019 plan year northern trust contributed 500 million to the us qualified plan at the beginning of 2018 retrospectively for the 2017 plan year the minimum required contribution to the us qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2020  the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 275 million for 2020  

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2019  approximately 29 of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1 of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 11 of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 89 of northern trust’s assets and 99 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment debt securities classified as available for sale make up 97 of level 2 assets with the remaining 3 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2019  all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 97  measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2019  northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million and 10 million shares of visa inc class b common stock visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 26 “contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values 

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

on january 1 2020 northern trust adopted asu no 201613  “financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” asu 201613 asu 201613 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments the main provisions of asu 201613 include 1 replacing the “incurred loss” approach under current gaap with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost 2 requiring entities to record an allowance for availableforsale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments as is required by the otherthantemporaryimpairment model under current gaap and 3 a simplified accounting model for purchased creditimpaired debt securities and loans 

in conjunction with the adoption of asu 201613 northern trust expects an increase in the allowance for credit losses of less than 20 million this change in accounting principle will be applied prospectively by increasing the allowance for credit losses on january 1 2020 with a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings net of income taxes periods prior to the adoption date will not be adjusted northern trust also expects that the corporation and the banks capital ratios will not be materially impacted by the adoption of this standard 

in august 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201815 “intangibles  goodwill and other  internal  use software subtopic 35040 customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” asu 201815 asu 201815 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license asu 201815 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years although early adoption is permitted asu 201815 is not expected to have a significant impact on northern trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations

as part of the integrated risk framework northern trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes embedded within its businesses to enable a riskinformed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies northern trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify measure manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines 

northern trust defines its risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk the board of directors and senior management are willing to assume to achieve the corporation’s strategic objectives and business plan consistent with prudent management of risk and applicable capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements it includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks using both monetary loss and nonfinancial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance thresholds and guideline levels that trigger escalation to senior management 

risk control 

risk control is an internal independent review function within the risk management function risk control is managed by the head of risk control and is comprised of model risk management credit review global compliance testing and basel independent verification groups each with its own risk focus and oversight model risk management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprisewide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and revalidating existing models credit review provides an independent ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities lastly basel independent verification promotes rigor and accuracy in northern trust’s ongoing compliance with basel iii requirements and adherence to enhanced prudential standards including liquidity stress testing the business risk committee has oversight responsibility with respect to risk control generally as well as each of these groups 

audit services 

audit services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within northern trust’s risk management framework audit services is managed by the chief audit executive with oversight from the audit committee audit services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the audit committee audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience including risk management expertise the chief audit executive reports directly to the audit committee and the corporation’s chief executive officer and is a nonvoting member of gerc 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk overview 

credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust’s activities a significant component of credit risk relates to loans leases securities and counterpartyrelated exposures northern trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large us financial institutions in that northern trust is generally 

 

credit risk framework and governance 

the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk to monitor and control credit risk the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies standards and programs designed to promote a prudent relationshipbased credit culture this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies standards programs and external regulations 

the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust’s diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust 

the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee the capital markets credit committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties 

the crc establishes and monitors creditrelated policies and programs throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro and chairs the crc independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by risk control 

credit risk measurement 

an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust’s internal risk rating system northern trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk calculations include entityspecific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity 

the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control 

loans and other extensions of credit 

a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the “offbalancesheet arrangements” section and in note 29 “offbalancesheet financial instruments guarantees and other commitments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as part of northern trust’s credit processes the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default independent from the credit risk management function credit review undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the credit risk management’s requirements 

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities including overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 

physical and financial collateral northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies 

netting onbalancesheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting agreements netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits 

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes human factors and systems or from external events 

operational risk overview 

operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties potential legal actions or other catastrophes to result in losses this includes the potential that continuity of service and resiliency may be impacted 

operational risk includes compliance fiduciary and legal risks which under the corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly 

operational risk framework and governance 

to monitor and control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that influence risk and drive action to reduce future loss events the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprisewide operational risk framework and businessspecific risk management programs to identify monitor measure manage and report on operational risk and mitigate northern trust’s exposure to loss several key programs support the operational risk framework including 





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

as discussed in risk control model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework 

the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the corporate operational risk policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks 

operational risk measurement 

northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trust’s ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999 th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a oneyear time horizon 

information security and technology management 

effective management of risks related to the confidentiality integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices northern trust’s information security and technology risk management framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and an information security and technology risk management policy and program approved by the business risk committee the framework is supported by an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across the businesses including the information security and technology risk committee istrc the istrc is chaired by the chief information risk officer who regularly reports to the business risk committee on the status of the information security and technology risk management program 

in addition to a strong governance process internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computerbased training phishing simulations and the designation of individuals as information security and privacy champions within the businesses in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information any findings identified are remediated following a riskbased approach 

in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization northern trust uses external thirdparty security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness these teams perform security program maturity assessments penetration tests security assessments and reviews of northern trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the cyber incident response plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents a cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions denials compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality integrity and availably of the assets of northern trust or its clients the plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact actions and status to senior management including the chief information security officer and chief information risk officer and appropriate stakeholders the plan is designed to work with enterpriselevel response plans and is reviewed tested and updated regularly 

northern trusts disclosure controls and procedures also address cybersecurity incidents and include elements to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents northern trust also maintains compliance programs to address the applicability of restrictions on securities trading while in possession of material nonpublic information including in instances in which such information may relate to cybersecurity incidents 

business resiliency and continuity management 

northern trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprisewide including staff technology and facilities to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes missioncritical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements 

northern trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers a highly redundant global network robust network security resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and workfromhome programs that provide further capability 

all of northern trust’s businesses are required to riskassess their critical functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements people systems vendor relationships and other assets arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical thirdparty vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis all of northern trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee 

northern trust has also begun exploring the integration of climaterelated scenario analyses into its broader risk management program to help align with certain recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd conducting such climaterelated scenario analyses and assessing the magnitude of climaterelated financial risks and opportunities related to northern trusts global assets are intended to position the organization to navigate uncertain climate futures more effectively 

fiduciary risk 

fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts i to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws or ii to properly discharge fiduciary duties fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction type of relationship and governing document 

fiduciary risk overview 

the fiduciary risk management framework identifies assesses measures monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level 

  

fiduciary risk framework and governance 

the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on fiduciary risk in addition the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization 

  

compliance risk 

compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws regulations rules other regulatory requirements or codes of conduct and other standards of selfregulatory organizations applicable to northern trust compliance risk includes the following two subcategories 





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

compliance risk framework and governance 

the compliance risk management framework identifies assesses controls measures monitors and reports on compliance risk the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee 

each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust’s compliance and ethics program 

the ceoc establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust’s compliance and ethics program the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee as appropriate and chairs the ceoc 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due because of firmspecific or marketwide stress events 

liquidity risk overview 

northern trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile northern trust’s balance sheet is primarily liabilitydriven that is the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits this liabilitydriven business model differs from a typical assetdriven business model where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support for example increased levels of lending northern trust’s balance sheet is generally comprised of highquality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress resulting in low liquidity risk 

liquidity risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all liquidity risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

the liquidity management policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the liquidity stresstesting buffer across a range of time horizons treasury in the first line of defense proposes liquidity risk management strategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities the asset and liability management committee alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite monitoring risk metrics overseeing balance sheet resources and reviewing reporting such as cash flows lcr and stress test results 

market and liquidity risk management in the second line of defense provides challenge to the first line activities evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness and escalates material items for corrective action the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures approving and monitoring risk metrics and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement 

liquidity risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by northern trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks including liquidity stress testing liquidity metric monitoring collateral management intraday management cash flow projections operational deposit modeling liquid asset buffer measurement funds transfer pricing and contingency funding planning 

the liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting both northern trust’s treasury and market and liquidity risk management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite holistic liquidity metrics 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

such as lcr and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile 

market risk 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk and trading risk interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

the asset and liability management policy policy on dealer trading activities and exposure limits for market risk are set by boardlevel committees and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income nii sensitivity of market value of equity mve and valueatrisk var across a range of time horizons 

treasury in the first line of defense proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite monitoring risk metrics overseeing balance sheet resources and reviewing reporting such as stress test results 

market and liquidity risk management in the second line of defense provides challenge to the first line activities evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness and escalates material items for corrective action the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in northern trusts financial position eg interest income market value of equity or capital due to changes in interest rates nii and mve sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the mve to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are sufficiently correlated which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite 

there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk in the banking book 

 

interest rate risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii and mve sensitivity nii sensitivity provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii mve sensitivity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve based on the periodend balance sheet 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nii sensitivity 

the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation 

 

the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward and 100 basis point downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period 

table 55 net interest income sensitivity as of december 31 2019 

the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

mve sensitivity 

mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates 

table 56 market value of equity sensitivity as of december 31 2019 



the mve simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk mve sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides global foreign exchange gfx services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods the gfx trading portfolio at northern trust is composed of spot forward and nondeliverable foreign currency transactions for gfx spot risk is driven primarily by foreign exchange rate fx risk and forward risk is driven primarily by interest rate ir risk 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the gfx var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical simulation monte carlo simulation and taylor approximation horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels of 95 and 99 subcomponent vars using only fx drivers and only 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

ir drivers and look back periods of one year two years and four years those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for gfx in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equallyweighted volatility the total var for gfx is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents 

table 57 global foreign currency valueatrisk 



during 2019  northern trust experienced one day of actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate during 2018  northern trust did not incur an actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer subsidiary northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 12 million for the year ended december 31 2019  

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps and swaptions entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps and floors all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by northern trusts treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities 

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished longterm earnings and capital as well as reputational damage to the firm strategic risk includes the following three subcategories 

 

strategic risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies and practices designed to identify analyze and limit where possible the impact of strategic risk the strategic risk management function is responsible for defining this framework and providing independent oversight of its application across northern trust in furtherance of this effort northern trust has established governance around its strategic planning processes to review and challenge strategic decisions 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in addition northern trust maintains a global stress testing framework which guides stress testing exercises across the company enterprise stress testing a component of this effort is specifically designed to look at the prospective impact of internal and external shocks on the organization northern trust also maintains the global emergency response plan which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise 

both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk

northern trust is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the united states as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the united states in which northern trust does business the discussion below outlines significant elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to northern trust changes in these laws or regulations or their application cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on northern trust’s businesses and results of operations 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged 



in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company the bank as the corporation’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition as a result of the amendment of the bhca by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act as discussed further below the corporation must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its eligible deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies as an illinois banking corporation the bank is also subject to illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area 

the bank is registered provisionally as a swap dealer with the us commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange act and is a member of the national futures association nfa as a provisionally registered swap dealer the bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding swap activity and the supervision examination and enforcement powers of the cftc nfa and other regulators certain of the corporation’s other affiliates are registered with the cftc as commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators under the commodity exchange act are members of the nfa and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the cftc and nfa 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve board its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec as a brokerdealer and an investment adviser and is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies the corporation’s brokerdealer subsidiary also is registered with the sec and municipal securities rulemaking board as a municipal securities dealer several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder those subsidiaries also act as investment advisers to various mutual funds exchangetraded funds and hedge funds of funds that are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 other subsidiaries are regulated by state regulators in various states 

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment company 

another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and cftc oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities including swapdealing activities 



the doddfrank act as amended 

the doddfrank act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the us financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the us financial stability oversight council the federal reserve board and the fdic in may 2018 the us congress passed and the president signed the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the “regulatory relief act” which revised parts of the doddfrank act and directed the federal reserve board and other federal regulators to revise parts of their regulations the federal reserve board has finalized or proposed some of the regulatory changes required by the regulatory relief act but other required changes remain to be finalized andor proposed the corporation cannot predict what changes may occur to the doddfrank act as a result of the regulatory relief act or the ultimate effect such changes would have on the corporation the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act as amended that currently are the most relevant to the corporation and its subsidiaries including the bank 

enhanced prudential standards  the doddfrank act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the enhanced prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management stress testing requirements and aggregate credit exposure limits under the final rules the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board be subject to supervisorconducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions conduct capital stress tests implement enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework discussed below in “liquidity standards” and aggregate credit exposure limits conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event the federal reserve board also has proposed rules that would implement early remediation requirements that are required to be established under section 166 of the doddfrank act 

the regulatory relief act immediately increased the threshold for imposing enhanced prudential standards on us bank holding companies from 50 billion to 100 billion in total consolidated assets this threshold will further increase to 250 billion in november 2019 for all us bank holding companies but the federal reserve board retains the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to certain us bank holding companies with between 100 billion and 250 billion in total consolidated assets to implement this change in october 2018 the federal reserve board proposed creating riskbased categories of banking organizations each of which would be subject to a tailored set of the enhanced prudential standards the federal reserve board has indicated that assuming it finalizes the october 2018 proposal without further modification the corporation will be a category ii institution which means that the corporation would remain subject to the existing enhanced prudential standards described above but would not be subject to the total lossabsorbing capacity requirement capital surcharge enhanced supplementary leverage ratio or aggregate credit exposure limit that apply to us bank holding companies that are global systemically important bank holding companies as of the date of this report the federal reserve board has not finalized the october 2018 proposal and the corporation cannot predict whether the october 2018 proposal will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the enhanced prudential standards are applied to the corporation 

resolution planning  as required by section 165d of the doddfrank act the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly issued a final rule that requires each us bank holding company with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company’s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition the fdic issued a final rule the “cidi resolution plan rule” that requires insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in total assets including the bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution’s failure the regulatory relief act immediately raised the threshold for application of the resolution planning requirement to 100 billion and this threshold will further increase to 250 billion in november 2019 although the federal reserve board retains the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to certain us bank holding companies with between 100 billion and 250 billion in total consolidated assets the federal reserve board and the fdic have indicated that in light of the regulatory relief act the agencies will publish proposals and solicit comment on revisions to the resolution planning requirements until such time as the federal reserve board and fdic propose and finalize changes to the resolution 



planning requirements the corporation and the bank will be required to submit resolution plans pursuant to the existing rules provided however that the agencies have indicated that the corporation is not required to submit a section 165d resolution plan before december 31 2019 and the fdic has indicated that the bank is not required to submit an insured depository institution resolution plan before july 1 2020 

on march 24 2017 the federal reserve board and the fdic provided joint written feedback to the corporation regarding the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 pursuant to section 165d of the doddfrank act the “2015 165d plan” the joint written feedback identified certain “shortcomings” in the corporation’s 2015 165d plan while the identification of these shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not “credible” the corporation was required to address the shortcomings in a satisfactory manner in the corporation’s resolution plan to be submitted to the federal reserve board and the fdic by december 31 2017 this plan was submitted on december 19 2017 the “2017 165d plan” if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly decide that the 2017 165d plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner then the federal reserve board and the fdic could jointly determine that the 2017 165d plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of such a joint determination the corporation could be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements restrictions on growth activities or operations or be required to divest certain assets or operations to date no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the 2017 165d plan in addition on june 27 2018 the bank submitted its resolution plan the “2018 cidi plan” to the fdic under the cidi resolution plan rule to date no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the 2018 cidi plan 

separately the european union bank recovery and resolution directive brrd was adopted for european union credit institutions including certain of the bank’s subsidiaries and branches effective january 1 2015 in accordance with applicable prudential regulation authority pra guidance a recovery plan for northern trust global services limited since reincorporated as northern trust global services se a uk incorporated indirect subsidiary of the bank has been established and will be reviewed at least annually pra guidance also requires institutions to produce resolution planning information in accordance with such guidance a resolution pack for northern trust global services se and the bank’s london branch has been prepared and such information will be reviewed every two years 

the corporation and the bank have and will continue to focus management attention and substantial resources to meet us and european regulatory expectations with respect to these resolution planning requirements 

orderly liquidation authority  under the doddfrank act certain financial companies such as the corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority for the orderly liquidation authority to apply the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must make a determination among other things that the corporation is in default or danger of default the failure of the corporation and its resolution under the us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the corporation and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects this determination must be recommended by twothirds of the fdic board of directors and twothirds of the federal reserve board absent such actions the corporation as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code if the corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority the fdic would be appointed as its receiver which would give the fdic considerable powers to resolve the corporation including 1 the power to remove officers and directors and appoint new ones 2 the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review 3 the ability to differentiate among creditors including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what such senior creditors would have received in bankruptcy liquidation and 4 broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution 

the volcker rule  the volcker rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for marketmaking hedging certain trading activities in us and foreign sovereign debt certain trading activities of nonus banking entities trading outside the united states and trading activities related to liquidity management the volcker rule also maintains significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds” such as hedge funds or private equity funds a banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds only if certain requirements are satisfied moreover a banking entity only may retain a limited ownership interest in such funds and must monitor and track investments in such covered funds carefully to ensure that the ownership interest in the fund does not exceed regulatory thresholds generally a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the funds or permitting the funds to use the name of the bank the volcker rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule compliance with the volcker rule generally has been required since july 21 2015 northern trust has conducted an 



enterprisewide review of affected activities taken steps to bring those activities into conformance and has established an enterprisewide compliance program to comply with the volcker rule 

in july 2018 the federal reserve board and other federal regulatory agencies having oversight over the volcker rule proposed amendments to the rule the notice of proposed rulemaking contains certain revisions to the volcker rule’s restrictions northern trust is evaluating the proposal to determine the impact such proposal will have if any if it becomes effective but as of the date of this report no final rule amendments have been issued the full impact of the volcker rule on northern trust ultimately will depend on the finalization of the july 2018 proposed amendments and further interpretation and guidance by the regulatory agencies responsible for its enforcement northern trust is monitoring developments with respect to the volcker rule actively and will revise further its operations and compliance programs as appropriate or required 

swaps and other derivatives  title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin trade reporting and recordkeeping title vii also requires certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” a “swap dealer” a “majorsecuritybased swap participant” or a “securitybased swap dealer” the cftc has finalized most rules further defining these registrant categories while the sec continues to draft rules related to securitybased swaps the cftc’s title vii rules and regulations are applicable to the bank’s activity as a swap dealer and include rules related to internal and external business conduct standards reporting and recordkeeping mandatory clearing for certain swaps and trade documentation and confirmation requirements and applied certain regulatory requirements to crossborder swap activities in addition the federal reserve board has finalized regulations applicable to the bank regarding mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap counterparties the sec’s rules related to securitybased swaps are not currently applicable to the bank’s swap dealing activity and the bank’s current trading activity does not mandate its regulation as a securitybased swap dealer northern trust continues to monitor title viirelated regulatory developments and will revise further its operations andor swaps compliance program as appropriate or required 

incentive compensation arrangements  the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions no final rule has been issued to date 

holding company support under the federal deposit insurance act 

the doddfrank act amended the federal deposit insurance act fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies such as the corporation to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations and fund dividend payments dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year including any prospective dividend would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or 



unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by certain bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios 

on january 30 2017 the federal reserve board announced modifications to capital plan and stress testing rules under the modified final rules the qualitative assessment of ccar was removed for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between 50 billion and 250 billion irrespective of the amount of onbalancesheet foreign exposure held by such bank holding companies as a result capital plans submitted by the corporation currently are no longer subject to objection from the federal reserve board on qualitative grounds in lieu of the qualitative assessment of ccar the corporation is subject to a horizontal capital review hcr focusing on specific areas of capital planning conducted as part of the federal reserve board’s normal supervisory process any supervisory findings resulting from the hcr are addressed through supervisory communications capital plans submitted by the corporation remain subject to objection from the federal reserve board on quantitative grounds 

the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in april 2018 as part of the federal reserve board’s 2018 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporation’s plan the corporation will submit its 2019 capital plan to the federal reserve board by april 5 2019 the federal reserve board is expected to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2019 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases in mid2019 

in addition to the ccar stress testing requirements federal reserve board regulations include doddfrank act stress tests dfast under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on june 21 2018 and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on october 31 2018 

in april 2018 the federal reserve board proposed revisions to the ccar exercise and dfast regulations that would in part integrate the forwardlooking stress test results with the nonstress capital requirements discussed below by using the results of the annual supervisory stress test to set specific buffer requirements above minimum capital requirements which restrict capital distributions under the capital rule and establish a single approach to capital distribution limitations the april 2018 proposal also would replace the 25 capital conservation buffer requirement with a stress capital buffer requirement and establish a stress leverage buffer requirement in addition to the minimum 4 tier 1 leverage ratio requirement under the april 2018 proposal an institution would be required to maintain capital ratios above its minimum plus its buffer requirements in order to avoid restrictions on its capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments an institution would be bound by the most stringent distribution limitations if any as determined by its capital conservation buffer requirement its stress leverage buffer requirement and if applicable its advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard 



the april 2018 proposal also would remove the stress testing assumption that an institution would make all planned capital distributions over the planning horizon including any planned common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock instead the stress buffer requirements would include only four quarters of planned common stock dividends in order to preserve the incentives for an institution to engage in disciplined forwardlooking dividend planning further the april 2018 proposal would adjust the methodology used in the supervisory stress test to assume that the institution takes actions to maintain a constant level of assets including loans trading assets and securities over the planning horizon and assume that the institution’s riskweighted assets and leverage ratio denominator generally remain unchanged over the planning horizon the april 2018 proposal also would remove the quantitative objection in ccar and eliminate the 30 percent dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of an institutions capital plan the federal reserve board would retain the ccar qualitative supervisory review and the ability to object to an institution’s capital plan on qualitative grounds based on the adequacy of the institution’s capital planning processes qualitative objection for institutions supervised by the large institution supervision coordination committee and other large and complex institutions 

separately the regulatory relief act immediately raised the threshold for application of dfast regulations to 100 billion and this threshold will further increase to 250 billion in november 2019 however the regulatory relief act did not directly affect the ccar exercise in its october 2018 proposal described above the federal reserve board proposed that the corporation will be subject to the qualitative and quantitative assessments of the ccar exercise and the dfast regulations but did not address the april 2018 proposal as of the date of this filing the federal reserve board has not finalized the april 2018 or october 2018 proposals and the corporation cannot predict whether either proposal will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the ccar exercise and dfast regulations are applied to the corporation 

additionally on december 21 2018 the federal reserve board announced it will not incorporate the current expected credit losses methodology cecl from accounting standards update no 201613 into its supervisory stress tests until at least 2022 to reduce uncertainty allow for better capital planning at affected firms and allow the federal reserve board to gather additional information on the impact of cecl the federal reserve board will still require banking organizations subject to companyrun stress test requirements as part of the ccar exercise to incorporate cecl into their internal stress testing processes beginning in 2020 

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022 

to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2018  and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios 

pursuant to the federal reserve board’s implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy 



the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of   december 31 2018   



in addition to the above as of january 1 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions such as the bank also are required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio 

basel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements the minimum capital conservation buffer in 2018 was 1875 and will increase to 25 for 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 and the federal reserve board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12month phasein of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0 slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subject 

on december 21 2018 the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that will permit banking organizations including the corporation and the bank to elect to phasein the dayone adverse effects of implementing cecl on regulatory capital calculations over a threeyear period the final rule will take effect april 1 2019 although cecl is not required to be implemented by public companies until 2020 

as discussed above in april 2018 the federal reserve board proposed revisions to the basel iii rules that would in part integrate the forwardlooking stress test results with the nonstress capital requirements discussed in this section if implemented the revisions would establish revised capital requirements for large banking organizations such as the corporation that are institutionspecific and risksensitive the april 2018 proposal would also modify several assumptions in the ccar exercise to align them better with an institution’s expected actions under stress separately the regulatory relief act directed the federal reserve board to revise the basel iii rules to provide relief from the supplementary leverage ratio requirement for certain funds that are deposited with a central bank further in october 2018 the federal reserve board proposed changes to the applicability thresholds for regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for certain large us banking organizations at the same time the federal reserve board indicated that assuming it finalizes the proposal without further modification the corporation will be a category ii institution meaning 



that it will become subject to certain additional capital planning and liquidity reporting requirements as of the date of this report the federal reserve board has not finalized the april 2018 or october 2018 proposals or proposed rules to implement the relief provided for in the regulatory relief act the corporation cannot predict whether the april 2018 or october 2018 proposals will be finalized whether and when the rules to implement the relief provided for in the regulatory relief act will be proposed and finalized and whether finalization of any proposal would alter the way in which the basel iii rules are applied to the corporation and bank 

liquidity standards 

in addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr has been fully implemented since january 1 2017 northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a daily basis and disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basis 

the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 which were to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board issued a proposal on may 3 2016 to implement the nsfr and revised aspects of that proposal in the two october 2018 proposals discussed above but has not adopted a final rule 

the enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporation’s board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile the board of directors has approved a liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcr 

prompt corrective action 

the fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiary 

as noted above the federal reserve board has issued proposed rules to implement certain “early remediation requirements” applicable to us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more as required under section 166 of the doddfrank act similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require institutions subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the institution’s financial condition deteriorates no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued as of the date of this report and the thresholds at which such a final rule would apply have been raised by the regulatory relief act and may be subject to further rulemaking by the federal reserve board 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

as an insured depository institution the bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the corporation as the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered 



transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted the bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions including the bank these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains antimoney laundering aml and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies including but not limited to standards for conducting due diligence verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities aml laws outside the us contain similar requirements the corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable aml laws and regulations compliance with applicable aml laws and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators and the corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation 

in may 2016 the financial crimes enforcement network fincen issued a new rule that requires certain financial institutions including the bank to obtain beneficial ownership information related to certain legal entity clients compliance with the new rule has been required since may 2018 as part of its aml compliance program northern trust has implemented and continues to maintain processes and controls to comply with the new beneficial ownership information collection rule 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in business with certain prohibited parties and jurisdictions as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts trafficking in narcotics proliferating weapons of mass destruction or representing other threats to national security known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction or account the corporation or the bank must reject or block such account or transaction as required and notify the appropriate authorities 

many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions 



deposit insurance and assessments 

the bank accepts deposits and eligible deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limit the current limit for fdic insurance for deposit accounts is 250000 for each depositor account under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency the fdic’s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions certain liquid assets are excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria this has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums due from custody banks in march 2016 the fdic finalized a surcharge assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more such as the bank in connection with the doddfrank act requirement to increase the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio from 115 to 135 without increasing the assessments of small insured depository institutions this surcharge assessment remained in effect until september 30 2018 when the reserve ratio reached 135 on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law placing new restrictions on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more such as the bank with respect to the deduction of all or a portion of all of their deposit insurance assessment payments as business expenses for federal taxation purposes as a result of this tax law change the bank is no longer able to deduct its fdic deposit insurance assessment payments 

fiduciary rule 

the us department of labor issued a final regulation and related prohibited transaction exemptions effective june 2017 which significantly expanded the concept of “investment advice” for the purpose of determining fiduciary status to employee benefits plans plan participants and individual retirement account ira owners under erisa and the internal revenue code irc however in june 2018 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit vacated the final regulation and related prohibited transaction exemptions and thus they are no longer in effect in anticipation of the fifth circuit’s action the department of labor issued guidance in may 2018 stating that pending the issuance of further regulations exemptions or administrative guidance it will not pursue prohibited transaction claims against investment advice fiduciaries who are working diligently and in good faith to comply with the “impartial conduct standards” set forth in the vacated regulation for transactions that would have been exempted by the vacated prohibited transaction exemptions the corporation is operating under the department of labor’s may 2018 guidance pending further developments 

community reinvestment act 

the bank is subject to the community reinvestment act cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank in october 2012 the federal reserve board the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the bank’s cra compliance approved the designation of the bank as a “wholesale bank” as a result of this designation the bank fulfills its cra obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development rather than retail cra loans federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the cra the bank received an “outstanding” cra rating from the federal reserve board in its most recent cra examination 

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice of data breaches to regulators and in some cases to clients 

most states the european union eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches for example a new european data protection framework  the general data protection regulation gdpr  was adopted on april 8 2016 and became effective in all european economic area eea member states on may 25 2018 gdpr is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across the eea to protect eea citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy gdpr has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the eea whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to or monitoring the behavior of eea individuals organizations that violate certain provisions of gdpr could be fined up to €20 million or 4 of their annual global turnover ie revenue for the preceding fiscal year whichever is greater 



the corporation has adopted and disseminated privacy policies and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security in accordance with applicable law

nonus regulation 

northern trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its nonus branches and subsidiaries operate for example branches and subsidiaries conducting banking and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act 2000 they are authorized by the pra or the financial conduct authority fca and regulated by the fca and in some instances also the pra the pra and fca exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees 

northern trust’s european branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the eu and the member states in which they are domiciled moreover northern trust’s noneuropean branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of these laws given that some eu laws apply to the wider eea which includes not only all eu member states but also the noneu member states iceland liechtenstein and norway and because of increasing extraterritorial effect of european legislation

market risks 

we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide 

our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions for example poor investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide that is due to underperformance relative to our competitors or benchmarks could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients further broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the recent shift in investor preference to lower fee products could impact our earnings negatively 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings although the federal reserve board has raised the target federal funds rate range in recent years interest rates generally remain low relative to historical levels low interest rate environments have had in the past and may have in the future a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding low interest rate environments also have historically had a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example in the past we have from time to time waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to shortterm interest rate levels while we did not implement any such fee waivers in 2018 we may do so in the future if shortterm interest rate levels decline low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

conversely a continued rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower 



performance yield and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 

further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 

changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdom’s referendum regarding whether to remain part of the european 

union remains uncertain 

in june 2016 united kingdom uk voters approved a departure from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk delivered a formal notice of withdrawal to the eu the terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period expected to last at least two years from the withdrawal notification date and such negotiation period likely will be followed by additional negotiations between the eu and the uk concerning future relations between the parties on december 8 2018 the uk and eu jointly published the terms of a withdrawal agreement which to date has failed to generate the support of the uk parliament and a nonbinding statement on future relations the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the final terms of withdrawal and the postbrexit relationships between the uk and other eu nations further such impact may be more pronounced if the withdrawal were to occur without a transition agreement in place between the uk and the eu brexit has contributed and may continue to contribute to market volatility particularly the valuation of the euro and british pound and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations additionally certain of our eu operations are conducted through subsidiaries located in the uk leveraging the eu financial services “passport” which permits activities throughout the single eu market without needing to obtain local authorizations in conjunction with our brexitrelated preparations and to mitigate the potential risk that our uk subsidiaries will be unable to retain their eu financial services “passports” we have taken steps to implement certain changes to our organizational structure including the establishment of an eudomiciled credit institution in luxembourg we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur additional costs associated with such measures and unforeseen political regulatory or other developments related to brexit or operational issues associated with the organizational restructuring related thereto also may result in additional costs and disruption to our eu banking business 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions and any disruptions related to such challenges may impact our earnings negatively 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market 



values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity further to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 

volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could impact our earnings negatively 

operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 





 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 

failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information resulting in theft loss or other misappropriation of this information regulators globally are also introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the theft loss or other misappropriation of such information for example the general data protection regulation gdpr which was adopted by the eu in 2016 and became effective in may 2018 establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal information noncompliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue the gdpr and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective cybersecurity relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered we expect to continue to face increasing cyberthreats 



including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients’ or other parties’ confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation 

further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are 

inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain 



assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 34  of our revenue in 2018  our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act and the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 



failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position in october 2017 we announced our “value for spend” expense management initiative through which we intend to realize 250 million in expense runrate savings by 2020 through improved organizational alignment process optimization and strategic sourcing although we have made progress toward achieving this level of expense runrate savings we cannot provide assurance that the overall “value for spend” initiative will be successful nor can we predict its overall effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact the purchase of our products and services negatively to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively 



the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the method pursuant to which the london interbank offered rate libor or other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

many financial markets currently rely on interbank offered rates each an ibor as mutually agreed upon reference rates serving as the basis for the pricing and valuation of assets trading positions loans and other financial transactions following historical concerns about attempted manipulation of ibor levels as well as a potential lack of liquidity in the underlying activity that contributes to an ibor setting global regulators have signaled interest in replacing existing ibor rates with alternative reference rates while there are multiple ibors libor is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in the world and serves as the reference rate for our floatingrate funding certain of the products that we own or offer various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved and many derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients’ risk libor has been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates the process for establishing libor announced in july 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 such announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other interest rate benchmarks or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor or other interest rate benchmarks any change in the availability or calculation of libor or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floatingrate funding the yield on loans or securities held by us the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into the value of loans securities or derivative instruments held by us or our clients which in the case of assets held by our clients could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets the trading market for securities based on libor or other benchmarks the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively further the potential transition away from the use of libor or other interest rate benchmarks or uncertainty related to any such potential transition may cause us to recognize additional costs or experience operational disruptions which may negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity risks 

if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits are reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes see “supervision and regulationliquidity standards” in item 1 “business” of 



this annual report on form 10k any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulationpayment of dividends” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 



regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally and subject to evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection including the gdpr regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act as amended by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act may have a material effect on our operations 

the doddfrank act became law in july 2010 and has had a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate in february 2017 an executive order was issued by the president i establishing core principles for regulating the us financial system and ii instructing the us secretary of the treasury to consult with heads of the member agencies of the us financial stability oversight council and to issue reports that identify laws regulations and policies including those implemented under the doddfrank act that inhibit federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles the required reports were issued in 2017 and 2018 and further action may be taken in the future regarding the reports’ recommendations in may 2018 congress passed and the president signed into law the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa containing significant amendments to the doddfrank act and requiring the federal reserve board and other regulatory agencies to adopt various implementing regulations while some of the implementing regulations have been finalized others remain subject to further regulatory action and there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the existing provisions will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies these legislative an d  regulatory changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements and any further changes to or resulting from the doddfrank act and the egrrcpa may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise affect our business adversely 

failure to address shortcomings identified by regulators in our 2015 resolution plan could result in restrictions or directives that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business 

section 165d of the doddfrank act and implementing regulations jointly issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic require bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in assets which includes the corporation to submit annually a resolution plan to the federal reserve board and the fdic detailing the bank holding company’s plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure if the regulators jointly determine that our resolution plan is not “credible” or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code the corporation could be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements restrictions on growth activities or operations or be required to divest certain assets or operations on march 24 2017 the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly identified certain “shortcomings” in the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 while the identification of shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not credible the corporation was required to address satisfactorily the identified shortcomings in the corporation’s resolution plan submitted to the federal reserve board and the fdic on december 19 2017 with respect to which the corporation has not yet received formal regulatory feedback if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly decide that the corporation’s 2017 resolution plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner then the federal reserve board and the fdic could jointly determine that the 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code and could subject us to the measures described above 



changes by the us and other governments to policies involving the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly 

in the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 

we may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us 

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be affected adversely to the extent that our reserves are not adequate 

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 



strategic risks 

if we do not execute strategic plans successfully we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely 

we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations operational failures litigation regulatory actions or fines the purported actions of our affiliates vendors or other third parties with which we do business the purported actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could materially and adversely affect our reputation as well as our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other 



parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 

we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current “fintech” environment in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 

our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 



we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act hr 1 the act was signed into law the act introduced a number of changes in thenexisting tax law impacting businesses including among other things a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 disallowance of certain deductions that had previously been allowed limitations on interest deductions alteration of the expensing of capital expenditures adoption of a territorial tax system assessment of a repatriation tax or “tollcharge” on undistributed earnings and profits of usowned foreign corporations and introduction of certain antibase erosion provisions in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a net tax benefit of 531 million associated with the act in conjunction with the issuance by the irs of additional guidance with respect to the act and certain additional analyses conducted by the corporation we also recognized an additional 48 million  of net income tax benefits in 2018 related to the act the ultimate impact of the act on our financial condition and results of operations in 2018 and future years remains uncertain and may differ materially from our expectations due to the issuance of technical guidance regarding elements of the act changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made with respect to the act and changes to the competitive landscape in which we operate and other factors 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 

our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected there can be no assurance that the federal reserve board will not object to our future capital plans in addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders an objection by the federal reserve board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us 

a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the 



bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 

our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series c noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series c preferred stock and series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt or elect to defer interest payments on our floating rate capital debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock

net interest income 

net interest income stated on an fte basis is a nongenerallyacceptedaccountingprinciple gaap financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes when adjusted to an fte basis yields on taxable nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable however the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided on page 88 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

an analysis of net interest income on an fte basis major balance sheet components impacting net interest income and related ratios are provided below 

table 13 analysis of net interest income fte

net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds adjusted for the impact of interestrelated hedging activity earning assets – including federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell interestbearing due from banks and interestbearing deposits with banks federal reserve and other central bank deposits securities and loans and leases – are financed by a large base of interestbearing funds that include client deposits shortterm borrowings senior notes and longterm debt earning assets also are funded by net noninterestrelated funds which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterestbearing cash and due from banks items in process of collection and buildings and equipment net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interestbearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates in addition the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income 

net interest income in 2018  was 162 billion  up 1935 million  or 14  from 143 billion  in 2017  net interest income on an fte basis for 2018  was 166 billion  an increase of 1889 million  or 13  from 148 billion  in 2017  due to an increased net interest margin and higher levels of average earning assets  average earning assets increased 26 billion  or 2  to 1137 billion  in 2018  from 1112 billion  in 2017  the net interest margin in 2018  was 143  up from 129  in 2017  the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2018  was 146  up from 133  in 2017

the increase in average earning assets was primarily funded by higher levels of shortterm borrowings and interestbearing deposits partially offset by reductions of demand and other noninterestbearing deposits average shortterm borrowings increased 41 billion  or 61  to 108 billion  in 2018  from 67 billion  in 2017  average interestbearing deposits increased 12 billion  or 2  to 746 billion  in 2018  from 734 billion  in 2017  average demand and other noninterestbearing deposits decreased 26 billion  or 11  to 205 billion  in 2018  from 231 billion  in 2017  



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

stockholders’ equity averaged 102 billion  in 2018  compared with 100 billion  in 2017  the increase of 2483 million  or 2  was attributable to currentyear earnings partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation’s share repurchase program and dividend declarations during the year ended december 31 2018  the corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 31  to 055  per share and repurchased 90 million  shares returning 14 billion  in capital to common stockholders compared to 8956 million  in 2017

the current year includes tax benefits primarily attributable to the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result of the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 a tax benefit recognized in 2018 resulting from a change in accounting method regarding the timing of tax deductions for softwarerelated expenses and adjustments recorded in the current year associated with the implementation of the tcja as outlined below these decreases to the provision for income taxes in the current year were partially offset by the impact of an increase in income before income taxes tax accounting changes in 2018 brought about by the tcja including the tax accounting associated with additional nondeductible expenses and a reduction in the income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises  also included in the 2017 tax provision were federal and state research tax credits related to the corporation’s technology spend between 2013 and 2016

table 16 impact of tax cuts and jobs act   

adjustments in the above table include a tax benefit of   168 million   resulting from an adjustment to the corporation’s 2017 income tax provision for mandatory deemed repatriation with respect to the pre2018 earnings of its nonus subsidiaries offset by a 127 million  net provision associated with the repricing of deferred taxes 

the income tax provision of 4349 million  for 2017  represented an effective tax rate of 266  and reflects reductions totaling 500 million  related to certain nonus subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states as a result of the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 these earnings and the earnings from prior years which have been reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states are deemed to have been repatriated to the united states and subject to a repatriation tax as of december 31 2018  northern trust’s repatriation tax has been estimated to be 1332 million  



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the 2016  income tax provision of 4846 million  represented an effective tax rate of 319  and reflects reductions of 501 million  related to certain nonus subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside the united states

the following table summarizes the results of operations of cis for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  on a managementreporting basis 

table 18 cis results of operations 

note stated on an fte basis 

the 47  increase in cis net income in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily resulted from higher net interest income trust investment and other servicing fees foreign exchange trading income and a lower provision for income taxes partially offset by higher noninterest expense including expenses associated with the ubs acquisition the 24  increase in cis net income in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily resulted from higher trust investment and other servicing fees net interest income and other noninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense including expenses associated with the ubs acquisition and lower foreign exchange trading income 

cis trust investment and other servicing fees 

cis trust investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody fund administration investment management and securities lending custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custodyadministration transaction volumes and number of accounts the asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on monthend market values quarterend market values or the average of monthend market values for the quarter the fund administration fees that are assetvaluerelated are priced using monthend quarterend or average daily balances investment management fees which are based generally on client assets under management are based primarily on market values throughout a period 

securities lending revenue is affected by market values the demand for securities to be lent which drives volumes and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed the other services fee category in cis includes such products as investment risk and analytical services benefit payments and other services revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee

during 2017 the corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes as a result the loan and lease balances for periods ended prior to january 1 2017 below have been adjusted to conform to the presentation for periods ended after such date the adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class there was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned oreo oreo is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections renegotiations and renewals the following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at december 31 2018  and each of the prior four yearends 

table 32 nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets of 1177 million  as of december 31 2018  decreased 376 million  or 24  from 1553 million  in december 31 2017  reflecting improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio and the commercial and institutional portfolio changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses 

allowance and provision for credit losses 

during 2017 the corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes the allowance for credit losses as of december 31 2016 remains unadjusted as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial 

table 33 changes in the allowance for credit losses   



the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships specific loss component and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit inherent loss component 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31 2018  and at each of the prior four yearends 

table 34 allocation of the allowance for credit losses   



specific component of the allowance  the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

at december 31 2018  the specific allowance component amounted to 100 million  compared with 54 million  at the end of 2017  the 46 million  increase is primarily attributable to outstanding loans and standby letters of credit in the residential real estate and commercial and institutional portfolios respectively 

the increase in the specific component of the allowance from 21 million  in 2016  to 54 million  in 2017  was primarily attributable to additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans partially offset by chargeoffs and payoffs 

inherent component of the allowance  the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans 

the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 202 million  to 1282 million  at december 31 2018  compared with 1484 million  at december 31 2017  which decreased 415 million  from 1899 million  at december 31 2016  

the decrease in 2018  was primarily driven by reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio the decrease in 2017  was primarily driven by improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios 

overall allowance  the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 1382 million  at december 31 2018  compared with 1538 million  at the end of 2017  the allowance of 1126 million  assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 035  at december 31 2018  down from a 1312 million  allowance assigned to loans and leases representing 040  of total loans and leases at december 31 2017  allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 256 million  and 226 million  at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

provision  the provision for credit losses was a credit of 145 million  and net chargeoffs totaled 11 million  in 2018  this compares with a credit provision of 280 million  and net chargeoffs of 102 million  in 2017  and a 260 million  credit provision and net chargeoffs of 152 million  in 2016  

impaired loans 

a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2018  impaired loans totaled 1162 million  and included 998 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 1398 million  at december 31 2017  which included 984 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 72 million  and 54 million  of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1 million as of december 31 2018  homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards 

critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

specific allowance  the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

inherent allowance  the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate finance 

the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2018  and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2018  northern trust utilized a discount rate of 379  for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 900  to 250  that averaged 439  the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 600  

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2018  measurement date the following were considered 

 

annual net pension expense in 2019 is expected to decrease by approximately   82 million  primarily driven by the increase in discount rate   

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected us plans’ periodic pension expense in 2019  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018  the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 35 sensitivity of us pension plans assumptions   



pension contributions  the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the pension protection act of 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2006 there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2018  plan year northern trust contributed 500 million  to the qualified plan at the beginning of 2018 retrospectively for the 2017 plan year the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero  in 2019  the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 270 million  for 2019  

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2018  approximately 29  of northern trust’s total assets and less than 1  of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 14  of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 86  of northern trust’s assets and 94  of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment debt securities classified as available for sale make up 96  of level 2 assets with the remaining 4  primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2018  all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 96  measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2018  northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million  and 10 million  shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 25 “contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet with cash and due from banks deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks shortterm money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 68  of total assets as of december 31 2018  the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank which include those placed at the federal reserve discount window totaled 473 billion  at december 31 2018  the corporation and the bank each satisfied the us liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2018  

the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity dividend payments from the bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets on august 3 2018 the corporation issued 500 million of 3650  senior notes due august 3 2028 the corporation also received 12 billion  of dividends from the bank in 2018  dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in further detail in note 31 “restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation’s stockholders the payment of principal and interest to note holders repurchases of its common stock and investments in or loans to its subsidiaries the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2018  were 9243 million  of common stock repurchases and 4054 million  of common stock dividends 

the corporation’s liquidity defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets was 8668 million  and 10 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively during and at yearend 2018  and 2017  these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries as needed average liquidity during 2018  and 2017  was 8870 million  and 7505 million  respectively the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 34 “northern trust corporation corporation only” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2018  provided below allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 

table 38 northern trust credit ratings as of december 31   2018   



a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 26 “derivative financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels the net maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay at december 31 2018  was 76 million  other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2018  that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings

in accordance with basel iii requirements capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches for each ratio the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy the following table provides a reconciliation of the corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total riskbased capital and its riskbased capital ratios under the applicable us regulatory rules as of december 31 2018  and 2017  

table 40 capital adequacy

northern trust’s risk management framework contains three interrelated elements designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification management and reporting a comprehensive risk inventory a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes the risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by northern trust supporting the consistent identification and classification of risks across the organization the risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views all identified risks inherent in northern trust’s business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories credit operational fiduciary compliance market liquidity and strategic risk all material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories 

northern trust implements its risk management framework through a “three lines of defense” operating model embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses the model used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization contains three roles each a complimentary level of risk management accountability within this operating model northern trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams the risk management function the second line of defense sets the direction for northern trust’s risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance audit services the third line of defense provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework

the chief risk officer cro oversees northern trust’s management of risk and compliance promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified understood appropriately monitored and mitigated the cro reports directly to the business risk committee and the corporation’s chief executive officer the cro regularly advises the business risk committee and reports to the committee at least quarterly on risk exposures risk management deficiencies and emerging risks in accordance with the risk management framework the executive risk management team of northern trust together with the chief financial officer head of capital and resolution planning general counsel and chief audit executive meets as the global enterprise risk committee gerc to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk within northern trust among other risk management responsibilities gerc receives reports or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues senior risk committees include 

the credit risk committee crc  establishes and monitors creditrelated policies and practices throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application 

the operational risk committee orc  provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities 

the fiduciary risk committee frc  is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities 

the compliance  ethics oversight committee ceoc  provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies implementation of the compliance and ethics program and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the corporation 

the market  liquidity risk committee mlrc oversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies key assumptions and practices 

the model risk oversight committee mroc is responsible for providing management attention direction and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within northern trust 

in addition to the aforementioned committees northern trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into gerc 

risk assessment appetite and reporting processes 

as part of the integrated risk framework northern trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes embedded within its businesses to enable a riskinformed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies northern trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify measure manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines 

northern trust defines its risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives and remain in compliance with applicable capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements it includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks using both 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

monetary loss and nonfinancial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance threshold and guideline levels that trigger escalation to senior management 

risk control 

risk control is an internal independent review function within the risk management function risk control is managed by the head of risk control and is comprised of model risk management credit review global compliance testing and basel independent verification groups each with its own risk focus and oversight model risk management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprisewide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and revalidating existing models credit review provides an independent ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities lastly basel independent verification promotes rigor and accuracy in northern trust’s ongoing compliance with basel iii requirements and adherence to enhanced prudential standards including liquidity stress testing the business risk committee oversees risk control generally as well as each of these groups 

audit services 

audit services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within northern trust’s risk management framework audit services is managed by the chief audit executive with oversight from the audit committee audit services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the audit committee audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience including risk management expertise the chief audit executive reports directly to the audit committee and the corporation’s chief executive officer 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation 

credit risk overview 

credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust’s activities a significant component of credit risk relates to loans leases securities and counterpartyrelated exposures northern trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large us financial institutions in that northern trust is generally 

 

credit risk framework and governance 

the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk to monitor and control credit risk the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies standards and programs designed to promote a prudent relationshipbased credit culture this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies standards programs and external regulations 

the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust’s diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust 

the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee the capital markets credit committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties 

the crc establishes and monitors creditrelated policies and programs throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro and chairs the crc independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by risk control 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk measurement 

an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust’s internal risk rating system northern trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk calculations include entityspecific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity 

the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control 

loans and other extensions of credit 

a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the “offbalancesheet arrangements” section and in note 28 “offbalancesheet financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as part of northern trust’s credit processes the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default independent from the credit risk management function credit review undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the credit risk management’s requirements 

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities including overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 

physical and financial collateral  northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies 

netting  onbalancesheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees  personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes human factors and systems or from external events 

operational risk overview 

operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties potential legal actions or other catastrophes to result in losses this includes the potential that continuity of service and resiliency may be impacted 

operational risk includes compliance fiduciary and legal risks which under the corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly 

operational risk framework and governance 

to monitor and control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprisewide operational risk framework and businessspecific risk management programs to identify monitor measure and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust’s exposure to loss several key programs support the operational risk framework including 

 

as discussed in risk control model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework 

the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the corporate operational risk policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks 

operational risk measurement 

northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trust’s ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

capital business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999 th  percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a oneyear time horizon 

information security and technology management 

effective management of risks related to the confidentiality integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices northern trust’s information security and technology risk management framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and an information security and technology risk management policy and program approved by the business risk committee the framework is supported by an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across the businesses including the information security and technology risk committee istrc the istrc is chaired by the chief information security officer who regularly reports to the business risk committee on the status of the information security and technology risk management program 

in addition to a strong governance process internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computerbased training phishing simulations and the designation of individuals as information security and privacy champions within the businesses in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information any findings identified are remediated following a riskbased approach 

in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization northern trust uses external thirdparty security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness these teams perform security program maturity assessments penetration tests security assessments and reviews of northern trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan 

the cyber incident response plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents a cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions denials compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality integrity and availably of the assets of northern trust or its clients the plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact actions and status to senior management including the chief information security officer and appropriate stakeholders the plan is designed to work with enterpriselevel response plans and is reviewed tested and updated regularly 

northern trusts disclosure controls and procedures also address cybersecurity incidents and include elements to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents northern trust also maintains compliance programs to address the applicability of restrictions on securities trading while in possession of material nonpublic information including in instances in which such information may relate to cybersecurity incidents 

business resiliency and continuity management 

northern trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprisewide including staff technology and facilities to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes missioncritical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements 

northern trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers a highly redundant global network robust network security resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and workfromhome programs that provide further capability 

all of northern trust’s businesses are required to riskassess their critical functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements people systems vendor relationships and other assets arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical thirdparty vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis all of northern trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually 

the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee

fiduciary risk 

fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts i to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws or ii to properly discharge fiduciary duties fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction type of relationship and governing document 

fiduciary risk overview 

the fiduciary risk management framework identifies assesses measures monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level 

  

fiduciary risk framework and governance 

the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on fiduciary risk in addition the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization 

  

compliance risk 

compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws regulations rules other regulatory requirements or codes of conduct and other standards of selfregulatory organizations applicable to northern trust compliance risk includes the following two subcategories 

 

compliance risk framework and governance 

the compliance risk management framework identifies assesses controls measures monitors and reports on compliance risk the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee 

each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust’s compliance and ethics program 

the ceoc establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust’s compliance and ethics program the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee as appropriate and chairs the ceoc 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due because of firmspecific or marketwide events 

liquidity risk overview 

northern trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile northern trust’s balance sheet is primarily liabilitydriven that is the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits this liabilitydriven business model differs from a typical assetdriven business model where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support for example increased levels of lending northern trust’s balance sheet is generally comprised of highquality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress resulting in low liquidity risk 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all liquidity risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the liquidity stresstesting buffer across a range of time horizons 

the asset and liability management committee alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite overseeing balance sheet resources and reviewing reporting such as cash flows and stress test results the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement 

liquidity risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by northern trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks including liquidity stress testing liquidity metric monitoring collateral management intraday management cash flow projections operational deposit modeling liquid asset buffer measurement funds transfer pricing and contingency funding planning 

the liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting both northern trust’s treasury and market and liquidity risk management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite holistic liquidity metrics such as lcr and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile 

market risk 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk and trading risk interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

exposure limits for market risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income nii sensitivity of market value of equity mve and valueatrisk var across a range of time horizons 

alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite overseeing balance sheet resources and reviewing reporting such as stress test results the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk is the risk to nii associated with the balance sheet or mve due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the mve to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

there are four commonly recognized types of structured interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii and mve sensitivity nii sensitivity provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii mve sensitivity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

 

nii sensitivity 

the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward and 100 basis point downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period 

table 42 net interest income sensitivity as of   december 31 2018 

the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided further the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to the impact of certain client deposit modeling enhancements 

mve sensitivity 

mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation 

 

the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates 

table 43 market value of equity sensitivity as of   december 31 2018   





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the mve simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk mve sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided further the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to the impact of certain client deposit modeling enhancements 

during the year ended december 31 2018  northern trust did not exceed the nii or mve sensitivity tolerances established by the board 

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equally weighted and exponentially weighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents 

table 44 foreign currency valueatrisk   



during 2018  and 2017  northern trust did not incur an actual trading loss in excess of the daily value at risk estimate 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 12 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps floors and swaptions an option to enter into an interest rate swap all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities 

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished longterm earnings and capital as well as reputational damage to the firm strategic risk includes the following three subcategories 

 

strategic risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies and practices designed to identify analyze and limit where possible the impact of strategic risk the strategic risk management function is responsible for defining this framework and providing independent oversight of its application across northern trust in furtherance of this effort northern trust has established governance around its strategic planning processes to review and challenge strategic decisions 

in addition northern trust maintains a global stress testing framework which guides stress testing exercises across the company enterprise stress testing a component of this effort is specifically designed to look at the prospective impact of internal and external shocks on the organization northern trust also maintains the global emergency response plan which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise 

both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors 



under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company the bank as the corporation’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition as a result of the amendment of the bhca by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act as discussed further below the corporation must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its eligible deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies as an illinois banking corporation the bank is also subject to illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area 

the bank is registered provisionally as a swap dealer with the us commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange act and is a member of the national futures association nfa as a provisionally registered swap dealer the bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding swap activity and the supervision examination and enforcement power of the cftc nfa and other regulators certain of the corporation’s other affiliates are registered with the cftc as commodity trading advisors or commodity pool operators under the commodity exchange act are members of the nfa and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the cftc and nfa

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment company 



another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and cftc oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities including swapdealing activities 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the us financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the us financial stability oversight council the federal reserve board and the fdic in february 2017 an executive order was issued by the current presidential administration i establishing core principles for regulating the us financial system and ii instructing the us secretary of the treasury to consult with heads of the member agencies of the us financial stability oversight council and issue reports that identify laws regulations and policies including those implemented under the doddfrank act that inhibit federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles certain of these required reports were issued during 2017 and additional such reports may be issued in the future the corporation cannot predict what changes may occur to the doddfrank act as a result of the executive order and related reports or the ultimate effect such changes would have on the corporation the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that currently are the most relevant to the corporation and its subsidiaries including the bank 

enhanced prudential standards  the doddfrank act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the enhanced prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements under the final rules the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board be subject to supervisorconducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions conduct capital stress tests implement enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework discussed below in “liquidity standards” conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event the federal reserve board also has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act in 2017 the us house of representatives approved a bill that would introduce a multipronged factorbased approach rather than the current threshold of 50 billion in total consolidated assets to be used in determining the financial institutions subject to enhanced prudential standards as of the date of this report the us senate had not approved such bill and the corporation cannot predict whether the bill will be enacted into law and whether such a law would alter the way in which the enhanced prudential standards are applied to the corporation if enacted 

resolution planning  as required by section 165d of the doddfrank act the federal reserve board and the fdic have jointly issued a final rule requiring each us bank holding company with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company’s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition the fdic has issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in total assets including the bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution’s failure the corporation and the bank submitted resolution plans pursuant to these rules in december 2015 on march 24 2017 the federal reserve board and the fdic provided joint written feedback to the corporation regarding the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 pursuant to section 165d of the doddfrank act the “2015 165d plan” the joint written feedback identified certain “shortcomings” in the corporation’s 2015 165d plan while the identification of these shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not “credible” the corporation was required to address the shortcomings in a satisfactory manner in the corporation’s resolution plan to be submitted to the federal reserve board and the fdic by december 31 2017 this plan was submitted on december 19 2017 if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly decide that the corporation’s 2017 resolution plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner then the federal reserve board and the fdic could jointly determine that the 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of such a joint determination the corporation could be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements restrictions on growth activities

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations and fund dividend payments dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year including any prospective dividend would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by certain bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios 



on january 30 2017 the federal reserve board announced modifications to capital plan and stress testing rules under the modified final rules the qualitative assessment of ccar was removed for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between 50 billion and 250 billion irrespective of the amount of onbalancesheet foreign exposure held by such bank holding companies as a result capital plans submitted by the corporation are no longer subject to objection from the federal reserve board on qualitative grounds in lieu of the qualitative assessment of ccar the corporation is subject to a horizontal capital review hcr focusing on specific areas of capital planning conducted as part of the federal reserve board’s normal supervisory process any supervisory findings resulting from the hcr are addressed through supervisory communications capital plans submitted by the corporation remain subject to objection from the federal reserve board on quantitative grounds 

the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in april 2017 as part of the federal reserve board’s 2017 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporation’s plan the corporation will submit its 2018 capital plan to the federal reserve board by april 5 2018 the federal reserve board is expected to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2018 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases in mid2018 

in addition to the ccar stress testing requirements federal reserve board regulations include doddfrank act stress tests dfast under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on june 22 2017 and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on october 27 2017 

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022 

to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2017  and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios 

pursuant to the federal reserve board’s implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy 



the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of   december 31 2017   



in addition to the above as of january 1 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions such as the bank also are required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio 

basel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements the minimum capital conservation buffer in 2018 is 1875 and will increase to 25 for 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 and the federal reserve board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12month phasein of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0 slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subject 

liquidity standards 

in addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr has been fully implemented since january 1 2017 currently northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a daily basis daily calculation of the lcr has been required since july 2016 additionally on december 19 2016 the federal reserve board finalized rules that will require large banking organizations such as the corporation to disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basis these disclosure rules are being phased in through october 2018 

the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 which were to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum 



standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board issued a proposal on may 3 2016 to implement the nsfr but has not adopted a final rule 

the enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporation’s board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile the board of directors has approved a liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcr 

prompt corrective action 

the fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiary 

as noted above the federal reserve board has issued proposed rules to implement certain “early remediation requirements” applicable to us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more as required under section 166 of the doddfrank act similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm’s financial condition deteriorates no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued as of the date of this report 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

as an insured depository institution the bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the corporation as the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted the bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions including the bank these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of 



applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains antimoney laundering aml and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies including but not limited to standards for conducting due diligence verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities aml laws outside the us contain similar requirements the corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable aml laws and regulations compliance with applicable aml laws and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators and the corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation 

in may 2016 the financial crimes enforcement network fincen issued a new rule that requires certain financial institutions including the bank to obtain certain beneficial ownership information from legal entity clients compliance with the new rule is not required until may 2018 and it is possible that fincen may issue additional guidance regarding its implementation

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice of data breaches to regulators and in some cases to clients 

most states the european union eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches for example a new european data protection framework  the general data protection regulation gdpr  was adopted on april 8 2016 and will become effective in all european economic area eea member states on may 25 2018 gdpr is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across the eea to protect eea citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy gdpr has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the eea whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to or monitoring the behavior of eea individuals

 item 1a  risk factors 

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k 

market risks 

we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide 

our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions for example poor investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide that is due to underperformance relative to our competitors or benchmarks could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients further broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the recent shift in investor preference to lower fee products could impact our earnings negatively 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings although the federal reserve board has raised the target federal funds rate range in recent years interest rates generally remain low relative to historical levels the low interest rate environment has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a continued low interest rate environment also may have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example in recent years we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to shortterm interest rate levels while the recent federal funds rate increases have reduced significantly the amount of such fee waivers they have not been altogether eliminated and they could increase in the future if shortterm interest rate levels decline low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

conversely a continued rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yield and fees a decline in the value of 



securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 

further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 

changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions and any disruptions related to such challenges may impact our earnings negatively 

the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdom’s referendum regarding whether to remain part of the european 

union remains uncertain 

in june 2016 united kingdom “uk” voters approved a departure from the european union the “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk delivered a formal notice of withdrawal to the eu the terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period expected to last at least two years from the withdrawal notification date and such negotiation period likely will be followed by additional negotiations between the eu and the uk concerning future relations between the parties the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of withdrawal and the postbrexit relationships between the uk and other nations brexit has contributed and may continue to contribute to market volatility particularly the valuation of the euro and british pound and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations additionally certain of our eu operations are conducted through subsidiaries located in the uk if our uk subsidiaries are not able to retain their eu financial services “passport” which permits activities throughout the single eu market without needing to obtain local authorizations we may incur costs to move operations and personnel from our uk subsidiaries to new or existing subsidiaries in other eu member states such as the planned move of our eubanking headquarters to luxembourg during any such transition we may incur additional costs as well as face greater operational risk and client concern with respect to our ability to maintain a high level of service delivery particularly relative to those of our competitors with subsidiaries in other eu member states facing a lesser degree of cost or disruption if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial 



market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity further to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 

volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could impact our earnings negatively 

operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 





 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businessesparticularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client typesand consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 

failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information resulting in theft loss or other misappropriation of this information 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective cybersecurity relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyberthreats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients’ or other parties’ confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions 



service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation 

further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 



failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 32  of our revenue in 2017  our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act and the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 

failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position in october 2017 we announced our “value for spend” expense management initiative through which we intend to realize 250 million in expense runrate savings by 2020 through improved organizational alignment process optimization and strategic sourcing we cannot provide assurance that such initiative will be successful nor can we predict its overall effect on our financial condition or results of operations 



acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact the purchase of our products and services negatively to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively 

the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity risks 

if we do not effectively manage our liquidity our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits are reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank 



given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes see “supervision and regulationliquidity standards” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulationpayment of dividends” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 



regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations 

the doddfrank act which became law in july 2010 has had a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate while the current presidential administration and us congress have indicated that the doddfrank act may be subject to scrutiny and that some of its provisions may be amended or repealed there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the existing provisions will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies in february 2017 an executive order was issued by the president i establishing core principles for regulating the us financial system and ii instructing the us secretary of the treasury to consult with heads of the member agencies of the us financial stability oversight council and to issue reports that identify laws regulations and policies including those implemented under the doddfrank act that inhibit federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles certain of the required reports were issued during 2017 and additional reports may be issued in the future further changes to or resulting from the doddfrank act the february 2017 executive order or the reports issued by the us secretary of the treasury may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise affect our business adversely these legislative andor regulatory changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 

failure to address shortcomings identified by regulators in our 2015 resolution plan could result in restrictions or directives that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business 

section 165d of the doddfrank act and implementing regulations jointly issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic require bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in assets which includes the corporation to annually submit a resolution plan to the federal reserve board and the fdic detailing the bank holding company’s plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure if the regulators jointly determine that our resolution plan is not “credible” or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code the corporation could be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements restrictions on growth activities or operations or be required to divest certain assets or operations on march 24 2017 the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly identified certain “shortcomings” in the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 while the identification of shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not credible the corporation was required to address satisfactorily the identified shortcomings in the corporation’s resolution plan to be submitted to the federal reserve board and the fdic by december 31 2017 the corporation submitted this resolution plan on december 19 2017 if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly decide that the corporation’s 2017 resolution plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner then the federal reserve board and the fdic could jointly determine that the 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code and could subject us to the measures described above 

changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings 

the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements ultimately could impact the profitability of certain of our business activities 



require changes to certain business practices or otherwise affect our business and earnings adversely see “supervision and regulation” under item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subject 

changes by the us and other governments to policies involving the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly 

in the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 

we may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us 

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be affected adversely to the extent that our reserves are not adequate 



if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 

strategic risks 

if we do not execute strategic plans successfully we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely 

we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 



damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 

we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current “fintech” environment in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 

our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 



failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can affect our earnings and growth prospects negatively 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management fiduciary and assetservicing businesses if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would affect our earnings negatively 

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act hr 1 the “act” was signed into law the act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses including among other things a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 disallowance of certain deductions that had previously been allowed limitations on interest deductions alteration of the expensing of capital expenditures adoption of a territorial tax system assessment of a repatriation tax or “tollcharge” on undistributed earnings and profits of usowned foreign corporations and introduction of certain antibase erosion provisions in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a net tax benefit of 531 million associated with the act however the ultimate impact of the act on our financial condition and results of operations in 2018 and future years remains uncertain and may differ materially from our expectations due to the issuance of technical guidance regarding elements of the act changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made with respect to the act and changes to the competitive landscape in which we operate and other factors 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 

our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected there can be no assurance that the federal reserve board will not object to our future capital plans in addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders an objection by the federal reserve board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us 



a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 

our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series c noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series c preferred stock and series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debts or elect to defer interest payments on our floating rate capital debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock

the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted on december 22 2017 the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 it also requires companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred  at december 31 2017  northern trust has made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act as follows 

table 16 impact of tax cuts and jobs act   

the amounts related to federal taxes on mandatory deemed repatriation and certain other adjustments are considered provisional as of   december 31 2017  as northern trust did not have the necessary information available to complete its accounting for the change in tax law and as such has provided a reasonable estimate northern trust will continue to refine the related calculations as additional analyses are completed in addition these provisional amounts may require adjustment based on an evolving understanding of the new tax law and the issuance of guidance by the internal revenue service irs  as a result of the changes in us tax law northern trust  expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 23 to 24 in 2018

the income tax provision of 4846 million  for 2016  reflects reductions totaling 501 million  related to certain nonus subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states the 2015  income tax provision of 4912 million  represented an effective tax rate of 335  and reflects reductions of 436 million  related to nonus subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside the united states

wealth management foreign exchange trading income 

foreign exchange trading income totaled 31 million  in 2017  a 55 million  or 64  decrease from 86 million  in 2016  the decrease is attributable to lower volatility and client volumes foreign exchange trading income in 2016  decreased 38 million  or 32  as compared to 2015  reflecting lower client volumes in 2016  

wealth management other noninterest income

table 26 treasury and other results of operations   



note stated on an fte basis 

treasury and other noninterest income in 2017  was 308 million  compared to 1331 million  in 2016  the decrease primarily reflects a decrease in other operating income a component of other noninterest income due to a prioryear gain on the sale of 11 million visa class b common shares 

treasury and other net interest income on an fte basis in 2017  was 50 million  down 386 million  or 89  from 436 million  in 2016  the decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin and lower levels of earning assets net interest income on an fte basis in 2016  decreased 693 million  or 61  to 436 million  from 1129 million  in 2015  the decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin partially offset by higher levels of earning assets 

treasury and other noninterest expense in 2017  equaled 1696 million  up 264 million  or 18  from 1432 million  in 2016  the increase is primarily attributable to higher general overhead costs including compensation and equipment and software expense partially offset by an increase in indirect expense allocations to cis and wealth management 

the benefit from income taxes was 1460 million  in 2017  compared to a benefit of 43 million  in the prior year primarily due to lower income before income taxes the net benefit attributable to the tax cuts and jobs act of 531 million  an increase in the excess tax benefit related to sharebased compensation and federal and state research tax credits of 176 million  related to the corporation’s technology spend between 2013 and 2016 and recorded in 2017

loans and leases 

during 2017 the corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes as a result the priorperiod loan and lease balances below have been adjusted to conform with currentperiod presentation the adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class there was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported 

the following table presents the amounts outstanding of loans and leases by segment and class as of december 31 2017  and the preceding four yearends 

table 30 composition of loan portfolio 

residential real estate 

the residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily composed of mortgages and home equity credit lines provided as an accommodation to clients residential real estate loans totaled 72 billion  at december 31 2017  or 22  of total us loans compared with 81 billion  or 24  of total us loans at december 31 2016  all residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing northern trust’s credit policies which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature such as option arm loans subprime loans loans with initial “teaser” rates and loans with excessively high loantovalue ratios residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loantocollateral value of no more than 65  to 80  at inception appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties 

of the total 72 billion  in residential real estate loans at december 31 2017  19 billion  were in florida 14 billion  were in the greater chicago area and 14 billion  were in california with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the united states served by northern trust legally binding commitments to extend residential real estate credit which are primarily equity credit lines totaled 10 billion  and 12 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

commercial real estate 

in managing its credit exposure management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where 1 the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes 2 the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property or 3 the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds the commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction acquisition and development loans extended primarily to investors well known to northern trust underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loantovalue ratios and debt service coverage requirements recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required 

commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of incomeproducing properties cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan these loans are primarily located in the illinois  



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

california  florida  texas  and arizona  markets construction acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization the intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with northern trust or another financial institution upon completion 

the table below provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types 

table 31 commercial real estate loans 

at december 31 2017  legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled 3125 million  and 138 million  respectively at december 31 2016  legally binding commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 5461 million  and 157 million  respectively

nonperforming assets and 90 days past due loans 

during 2017 the corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain nonperforming loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes as a result the priorperiod balances below have been adjusted to conform with currentperiod presentation these adjustments generally reflect reclassification of nonperforming loans and leases from commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class there was no impact on total nonperforming loans and leases previously reported 

nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned oreo oreo is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections renegotiations and renewals the following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at december 31 2017  and each of the prior four yearends 

table 32 nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets of 1553 million  as of december 31 2017  decreased 101 million  or 6  reflecting improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio partially offset by additional impaired loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and of the qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses 

allowance and provision for credit losses 

during 2017 the corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes the previously reported allowance for credit losses remains unadjusted as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial 

table 33 changes in the allowance for credit losses   





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships specific loss component and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit inherent loss component 

the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31 2017  and at each of the prior four yearends 

table 34 allocation of the allowance for credit losses   



specific component of the allowance  the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

at december 31 2017  the specific allowance component amounted to 54 million  compared with 21 million  at the end of 2016  the 33 million  increase is primarily attributable to additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans partially offset by chargeoffs and payoffs 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from 31 million  in 2015  to 21 million  in 2016  was primarily attributable to chargeoffs and payoffs partially offset by additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans 

inherent component of the allowance  the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans 

the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 415 million  to 1484 million  at december 31 2017  compared with 1899 million  at december 31 2016  which decreased 403 million  from 2302 million  at december 31 2015  

the decrease in 2017  was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios the decrease in 2016  was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the residential real estate and private client portfolios 

overall allowance  the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 1538 million  at december 31 2017  compared with 1920 million  at the end of 2016  the allowance of 1312 million  assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 040  at december 31 2017  down from a 1610 million  allowance representing 048  of total loans and leases at december 31 2016  allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 226 million  and 310 million  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

provision  the provision for credit losses was a credit of 280 million  and net chargeoffs totaled 102 million  in 2017  this compares with a credit provision of 260 million  and net chargeoffs of 152 million  in 2016  and a 430 million  credit provision and net chargeoffs of 195 million  in 2015  

impaired loans 

a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2017  impaired loans totaled 1398 million  and included 984 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 1561 million  at december 31 2016  which included 1276 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 54 million  and 21 million  of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1 million as of december 31 2017  homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards 

critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

specific allowance  the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

inherent allowance  the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data 

specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment 

framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments for each segment the probability of default 

and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate finance 

the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2017  and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2017  northern trust utilized a discount rate of 446  for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 900  to 250  that averaged 439  the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 675  

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2017  measurement date the following were considered 

 

annual net pension expense in 2018 is expected to increase by approximately   19 million  primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets   



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected us plans’ periodic pension expense in 2018  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017  the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 35 sensitivity of us pension plans assumptions   



pension contributions  the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2017  and 2016  northern trust contributed 500 million  to the qualified plan at the beginning of 2018 the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero  in 2018  the remaining maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 250 million  for 2018  

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2017  approximately 25  of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1  of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 17  of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 83  of northern trust’s assets and 98  of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment securities classified as available for sale make up 97  of level 2 assets with the remaining 3  primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2017  all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 96  measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2017  the fair value of northern trust’s level 3 assets was 43 million  level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from northern trust clients to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities northern trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trades and bids the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited 

as of december 31 2017  northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million  and 10 million  shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 24 “contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values

the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk to monitor and control credit risk the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies standards and practices designed to promote a conservative credit culture this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies standards and external regulations 

the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust’s diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust 

the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee the capital markets credit committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the crc establishes and monitors creditrelated policies and practices throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro and chairs the crc independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by risk control 

credit risk measurement 

an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust’s internal risk rating system northern trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk calculations include entityspecific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity 

the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control 

loans and other extensions of credit 

a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the “offbalancesheet arrangements” section and in note 27 “offbalancesheet financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as part of northern trust’s credit processes the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default independent from the credit risk management function credit review undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the credit risk management’s requirements 

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities including overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 

physical and financial collateral  northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies 

netting  onbalancesheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees  personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits 

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes human factors and systems or from external events 

operational risk overview 

operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties potential legal actions or other catastrophes to result in losses 

operational risk includes compliance fiduciary and legal risks which under the corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly 

operational risk framework and governance 

to monitor and control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprisewide operational risk framework and businessspecific risk management programs to identify monitor measure and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust’s exposure to loss several key programs support the operational risk framework including 

 

as discussed in risk control model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework 

the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the corporate operational risk policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks 

operational risk measurement 

northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trust’s ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999 th  percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a oneyear time horizon 

information security and technology management 

effective management of risks related to the confidentiality integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices northern trust’s approach to information security begins at a governance level with an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across northern trust’s businesses in addition to a strong governance process internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computerbased training phishing simulations and the designation of individuals as information security and privacy champions within the businesses in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information any findings identified are remediated following a riskbased approach 

in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization northern trust uses external thirdparty security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness these teams perform security program maturity assessments penetration tests security assessments and reviews of northern trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan 

the cyber incident response plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents a cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions denials compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality integrity and availably of the assets of northern trust or its clients the plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact actions and status to senior management including the chief information security officer and appropriate stakeholders the plan is designed to work with enterpriselevel response plans and is tested routinely 

business resiliency and continuity management 

northern trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprisewide including staff technology and facilities to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes missioncritical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements 

northern trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers a highly redundant global network robust network security resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and workfromhome programs that provide further capability 

all of northern trust’s businesses are required to riskassess regularly their critical functions and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements people systems vendor relationships and other assets arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical thirdparty vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis all of northern trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually 

the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee

fiduciary risk 

fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts i to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws or ii to properly discharge fiduciary duties fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction type of relationship and governing document 

fiduciary risk overview 

the fiduciary risk management framework identifies assesses measures monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level 

  

fiduciary risk framework and governance 

the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on fiduciary risk in addition the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization 

  

compliance risk 

compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws regulations rules other regulatory requirements or codes of conduct and other standards of selfregulatory organizations applicable to northern trust compliance risk includes the following two subcategories 

 

compliance risk framework and governance 

the compliance risk management framework identifies assesses controls measures monitors and reports on compliance risk the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee 

each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust’s compliance and ethics program 

the ceoc establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust’s compliance and ethics program the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee as appropriate and chairs the ceoc 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due because of firmspecific or marketwide events 

liquidity risk overview 

northern trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile northern trust’s balance sheet is liabilitydriven that is the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits which are generally related to the level of global custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits this liabilitydriven business model differs from a typical assetdriven business model where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support for example increased levels of lending for execution of the organization’s investment strategy northern trust’s balance sheet generally consists of highquality assets with relatively short durations resulting in low liquidity risk 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all liquidity risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the liquidity stresstesting buffer across a range of time horizons 

the asset and liability management committee alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite overseeing balance sheet resources and reviewing reporting such as cash flows and stress test results the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for approving subpolicies and procedures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving methodologies and key assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement 

liquidity risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by northern trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks including liquidity stress testing liquidity metric monitoring collateral management intraday management cash flow projections operational deposit assessments liquid asset buffer measurement funds transfer pricing and contingency funding planning 

the liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting both northern trust’s treasury and market and liquidity risk management functions produce management reports using the outputs from the liquidity assessment monitoring and analysis enabling oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of risk within the approved risk appetite holistic liquidity metrics such as lcr and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile 

market risk 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk and trading risk interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

exposure limits for market risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income nii sensitivity of market value of equity mve and valueatrisk var across a range of time horizons 

alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite overseeing balance sheet resources and reviewing reporting such as stress test results the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for approving subpolicies and procedures establishing and monitoring risk metrics and approving methodologies and key assumptions that drive market risk measurement 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk is the risk to nii associated with the balance sheet or mve due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the mve to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trust’s interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to nii even in periods of volatile interest rates 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

there are four commonly recognized types of structured interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk analysis monitoring and reporting 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii and mve sensitivity nii sensitivity provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii mve sensitivity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

 

nii sensitivity 

the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in nii sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from that assumed the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period given the low level of interest rates the simulation of nii for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

table 42 net interest income sensitivity as of   december 31 2017 

the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided further the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to changes to client deposit pricing assumptions and the implementation of interest rate risk model enhancements 

mve sensitivity 

mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in mve sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from the incorporated assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation 

 

the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current market implied forward rates given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero the simulation of mve for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

table 43 market value of equity sensitivity as of   december 31 2017   





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the mve simulations do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk mve sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided further the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to changes to client deposit pricing assumptions and the implementation of interest rate risk model enhancements 

during the year ended december 31 2017  northern trust did not exceed its nii sensitivity limits or its mve sensitivity limits 

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equally weighted and exponentially weighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents 

table 44 foreign currency valueatrisk   





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

during 2017  and 2016  northern trust did not incur an actual trading loss in excess of the daily value at risk estimate 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 08 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps floors and swaptions an option to enter into an interest rate swap all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities 

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished longterm earnings and capital as well as reputational damage to the firm strategic risk includes the following three subcategories 

 

strategic risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies frameworks and practices designed to identify analyze and limit where possible the sources and negative consequences of strategic risk the strategic risk management function is responsible for defining the strategic risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust in furtherance of this effort northern trust has established governance and strategic planning processes for review and effective challenge where appropriate of business strategy and new products 

in addition northern trust maintains a global stress testing framework which governs stress testing exercises conducted by northern trust’s businesses and enterprise tabletop exercises that examine the consequences of macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks northern trust also maintains the global emergency response plan which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise 

both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company the bank as the corporation’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition as a result of the amendment of the bhca by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act as discussed further below the corporation must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act 



of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment company 

another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and cftc oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities including swapdealing activities 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the us financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the us financial stability oversight council the federal reserve board and the fdic in february 2017 an executive order was issued by the new presidential administration i establishing core principles for regulating the us financial system and ii instructing the us secretary of the treasury to consult with heads of the member agencies of the us financial stability oversight council and issue a report within 120 days and periodically thereafter that identifies laws regulations and policies including those implemented under the doddfrank act that inhibit federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles the corporation cannot predict what changes may occur to the doddfrank act as a result of the executive order or the ultimate effect such changes would have on the corporation the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that currently are the most relevant to the corporation and its subsidiaries including the bank 

enhanced prudential standards  the doddfrank act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the enhanced prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements under the final rules the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board be subject to supervisorconducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions conduct capital stress tests implement enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework discussed below in “liquidity standards” conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event the federal reserve board also has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act 

resolution planning   as required by section 165d of the doddfrank act the federal reserve board and fdic have jointly issued a final rule requiring each us bank holding company with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company’s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition the fdic has issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in total assets including the bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution’s failure the corporation and the bank submitted resolution plans pursuant to these rules in december 2015 if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 pursuant to section 165d of the doddfrank act is not credible and the corporation fails to address the deficiencies in a timely manner the corporation could be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements restrictions on growth activities or operations or be required to divest certain assets or operations on august 2 2016 the federal reserve board and the fdic announced that they will provide feedback and guidance to the corporation regarding the december 2015 resolution plan and that accordingly the corporation is not required to submit an updated resolution plan until december 31 2017 to date no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the december 2015 resolution plan separately the european union bank recovery and resolution directive brrd was adopted for european union credit institutions including certain of the bank’s subsidiaries and branches effective january 1 2015 in accordance with applicable prudential regulation authority pra guidance a recovery plan for northern trust global services limited ntgsl a uk incorporated indirect subsidiary of the bank has been prepared and will be reviewed at least annually pra guidance also requires institutions to produce resolution planning information in two phases in accordance with such guidance a phase 1 resolution pack for ntgsl and the bank’s london branch has been prepared and such information will be reviewed every two years the corporation and the bank have and will continue to focus management attention and substantial resources to meet us and european regulatory expectations with respect to these resolution planning requirements

swaps and other derivatives  title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin trade reporting and recordkeeping title vii also requires certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” a “swap dealer” a “majorsecuritybased swap participant” or a “securitybased swap dealer” the cftc and sec have finalized rules further defining these registrant categories and the cftc sec federal reserve board and other us regulators are in the process of adopting rules and regulations to implement title vii the cftc has finalized many rules and regulations applicable to swap dealers including the bank such as internal and external business conduct standards reporting and recordkeeping mandatory clearing for certain swaps the mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap entities exchangetrading rules and trade documentation and confirmation requirements and applied certain regulatory requirements to crossborder swap activities the sec has finalized rules that among other things enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities require regulatory reporting of securitybased swap information and the public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction volume and pricing information by swap data repositories and define the scope of swap data repository registration requirements the scope of securitybased swap dealer and majorsecuritybased swap participant registration business conduct and trade acknowledgment and verification requirements and certain regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities it is anticipated that the sec will continue with its rulemaking process which will further clarify among other things margin requirements for uncleared securitybased swaps central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps additionally the us banking agencies have separately finalized rules requiring the posting and collection of margin by swap dealers including the corporation and the bank for certain uncleared swaps as noted above the cftc and sec have yet to complete the 



implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop 

incentive compensation arrangements  the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions no final rule has been issued to date 

holding company support under the federal deposit insurance act 

the doddfrank act amended the federal deposit insurance act fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies such as the corporation to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year including any prospective dividend would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by certain bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios 



on january 30 2017 the federal reserve board announced modifications to capital plan and stress testing rules for the 2017 ccar cycle under the final rules the qualitative assessment of ccar has been removed for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between 50 billion and 250 billion irrespective of the amount of onbalancesheet foreign exposure held by such bank holding companies as a result capital plans submitted by the corporation will no longer be subject to objection from the federal reserve board on qualitative grounds and the corporation will be subject to certain reduced regulatory reporting requirements in lieu of the qualitative assessment of ccar the corporation will be subject to a targeted horizontal review of specific areas of capital planning conducted as part of the federal reserve board’s normal supervisory process any supervisory findings resulting from the targeted horizontal review will be addressed through supervisory communications capital plans submitted by the corporation remain subject to objection from the federal reserve board on quantitative grounds 

the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in april 2016 as part of the federal reserve board’s 2016 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporation’s plan the corporation will submit its 2017 capital plan to the federal reserve board by april 5 2017 the federal reserve board has indicated that it expects to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2017 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases by june 30 2017 

in addition to the ccar stress testing requirements federal reserve board regulations include doddfrank act stress tests dfast under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on june 23 2016 and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on october 27 2016 

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022 

to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2016  and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios 

pursuant to the federal reserve board’s implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy 



the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2016   



in addition to the above beginning in 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions such as the bank also will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio 

basel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 125 in 2017 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 and the federal reserve board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12month phasein of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0 slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subject 

liquidity standards 

in addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr has been phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 currently northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a daily basis daily calculation of the lcr has been required since july 2016 additionally on december 19 2016 the federal reserve board finalized rules that will require large banking organizations such as the corporation to disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basis these disclosure rules will be phased in from april 2017 through october 2018 

the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum standard by 



january 1 2018 the federal reserve board issued a proposal on may 3 2016 to implement the nsfr but has not adopted a final rule 

the enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporation’s board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile the board of directors has approved a liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcr 

prompt corrective action 

the fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiary 

as noted above the federal reserve board has issued proposed rules to implement certain “early remediation requirements” applicable to us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more as required under section 166 of the doddfrank act similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm’s financial condition deteriorates no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to date

as an insured depository institution the bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the corporation as the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted the bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions including the bank these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of 



applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states and the eu have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators announced that they will propose enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to certain large and interconnected financial institutions including the corporation and the bank the regulators expect that the proposal will include standards related to i cyber risk governance ii cyber risk management iii internal dependency management iv external dependency management and v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness certain “sectorcritical” systems operated by financial institutions would be subject to more stringent standards as of december 31 2016 the regulators have not released additional information on the prospective proposal 

consumer laws and regulations 

the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the doddfrank act established an independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb was tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act has led to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws 

nonus regulation

instances also the pra the pra and fca exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees 

northern trust’s european branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the european economic area eea moreover northern trust’s noneuropean branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of these laws given the increasing extraterritorial effect of european legislation

 item 1a – risk factors 

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k 

market risks 

market volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions may affect our earnings negatively 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors have historically reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide such conditions also may affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which would reduce our earnings 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings although the federal reserve board has raised the target federal funds rate range in recent years thus far such increases have been measured and interest rates generally remain near historical lows the low interest rate environment that has persisted since the 20072008 global financial crisis has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a continued low interest rate environment also may have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example we have waived in recent years and may waive in the future certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to shortterm interest rate levels low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively if for example such a rise causes our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yield and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 

further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 



changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or continuing pressure on oil prices and any disruptions related to such challenges may impact our earnings negatively 

the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdom’s referendum regarding whether to remain part of the european 

union remains uncertain 

in june 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved a departure from the european union the “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of withdrawal and the postbrexit relationships that the uk will negotiate with the eu and other noneu nations increased market volatility and further global economic deterioration resulting from brexit or concern about brexit could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations the volatility in the exchange rate for the british pound has increased since the announcement of brexit which has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our results of operations additionally certain of our eu operations are conducted through a uk branch of the bank and other of our subsidiaries located in the uk if our uk subsidiaries are not able to retain their eu financial services “passport” which permits crossborder services and activities throughout the single eu market without needing to obtain local authorizations we may incur costs to establish one or more subsidiaries in other eu member states and move operations and personnel accordingly further during any such transition we may be faced with greater operational risk and client concern with respect to our ability to maintain a high level of service delivery particularly relative to those of our competitors with subsidiaries in other eu member states facing a lesser degree of cost or disruption if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity further to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 



volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could impact our earnings negatively 

operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 

 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk 



management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 

failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches – including cyberattacks – could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information resulting in theft loss or other misappropriation of this information 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective cybersecurity relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyberthreats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients’ or other parties’ confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation 

further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of 



the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology and the need to frequently update our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 



we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 25  of our revenue in 2016  our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies further it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act and the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 

failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact the purchase of our products and services negatively to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make 



difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of earnings negatively 

the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain in recent years the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity risks 

if we do not effectively manage our liquidity our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits are reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability new regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes see “supervision and regulation—liquidity standards” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if 



needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 

regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations 

the doddfrank act which became law in july 2010 has had a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate while the new presidential administration and us congress have indicated that the doddfrank act may be subject to further scrutiny and that some of its provisions may be amended or repealed there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the existing provisions will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies in february 2017 an executive order was issued by the new presidential administration i establishing core principles for regulating the us financial system and ii instructing the us secretary of the treasury to 



consult with heads of the member agencies of the us financial stability oversight council and to issue reports that identify laws regulations and policies including those implemented under the doddfrank act that inhibit federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles further changes to or resulting from the doddfrank act or the recent executive order may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise affect our business adversely these legislative andor regulatory changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 

changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings 

the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements ultimately could impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise affect our business and earnings adversely see “supervision and regulation” under item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subject 

money market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsors 

on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules was completed in october 2016 the effects of these rules could lead to lower investor demand for money market mutual funds reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise affect our business earnings or financial condition adversely 

changes by the us and other governments to policies involving the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly 

in the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods the new presidential administration has called for substantial reform to financial services regulation which may include comprehensive changes to existing laws and regulations and their application by regulators we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally other governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or enhanced regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in 



injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 

we may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us 

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be affected adversely to the extent that our reserves are not adequate 

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 

strategic risks 

if we do not execute strategic plans successfully we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key 



personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely 

we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 

we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 



our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can affect our earnings and growth prospects negatively 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management fiduciary and assetservicing businesses if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would affect our earnings negatively 

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 

our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt   

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make 



other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected there can be no assurance that the federal reserve board will not object to our future capital plans in addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders an objection by the federal reserve board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us 

a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 

our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series c noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series c preferred stock and series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debts or elect to defer interest payments on our floating rate capital debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock

the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships specific loss component and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit inherent loss component 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31 2016  and at each of the prior four yearends 

table 32 allocation of the allowance for credit losses   



specific component of the allowance  the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

at december 31 2016  the specific allowance component amounted to 21 million  compared with 31 million  at the end of 2015  the 10 million  decrease is primarily attributable to chargeoffs and payoffs partially offset by additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans 

the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from 211 million  in 2014  to 31 million  in 2015  was primarily attributable to chargeoffs and restructurings and payoffs as a result of improvements in commercial and institutional commercial real estate and residential real estate loans 

inherent component of the allowance  the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans 

the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 403 million  to 1899 million  at december 31 2016  compared with 2302 million  at december 31 2015  and decreased 446 million  from 2748 million  at december 31 2014  

the decrease in 2016  reflected improved credit quality across the portfolio and an update to the underlying data used in the quantitative portion of the inherent allowance for credit losses that resulted in a reduction in the allowance ascribed to the residential real estate and private client portfolios the decrease in 2015  was driven by improved credit quality across the loan and lease portfolio coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses 

overall allowance  the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 1920 million  at december 31 2016  compared with 2333 million  at the end of 2015  the allowance of 1610 million  assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 048  at december 31 2016  down from a 1938 million  allowance representing 058  of total loans and leases at december 31 2015  allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 310 million  and 395 million  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

provision  the provision for credit losses was a credit of 260 million  and net chargeoffs totaled 152 million  in 2016  this compares with a credit provision of 430 million  and net chargeoffs of 195 million  in 2015  and a 60 million  provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 180 million  in 2014  

impaired loans 

a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2016  impaired loans totaled 1561 million  and included 1276 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 1573 million  at december 31 2015  which included 1171 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 21 million  and 31 million  of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1 million as of december 31 2016 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards 

critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses pension plan accounting and otti of investment securities management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

specific allowance  the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

inherent allowance  the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data 

specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment 

framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments for each segment the probability of default 

and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate finance 

the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2016  and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2016  northern trust utilized a discount rate of 471  for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 750 to 250 that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 700  

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2016  measurement date the following were considered 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected us plans’ periodic pension expense in 2017  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 33 sensitivity of us pension plans assumptions   



pension contributions  the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2016  and 2015  due to strong asset performance over the past several years the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2017  the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 225 million for 2017  

otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities 

under gaap companies are required to perform periodic reviews of securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the declines in value are considered otherthantemporary for availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities that management has no intent to sell and believes it morelikelythannot that it will not be required to sell prior to recovery the consolidated statements of income reflect only the credit loss component of an impairment while the remainder of the fair value loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income the credit loss component recognized in earnings is based on the amount of principal and interest not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security for debt securities that northern trust intends to sell or would morelikelythannot be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis the full impairment that is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized in earnings the application of significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in assessing whether otti exists and if so in the calculation of the credit loss component of the otti assumptions used in this process are inherently subject to change in future periods different judgments or subsequent changes in estimates could result in materially different impairment loss recognition 

northern trust conducts security impairment reviews quarterly to identify and evaluate those securities within its investment portfolio that have indications of possible otti a determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is otherthantemporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security factors northern trust considers in determining whether impairment is otherthantemporary include but are not limited to the length of time the security has been impaired the severity of the impairment the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions northern trust’s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis 

there were 37 million  and 42 million  of losses recognized in 2016 and 2014 respectively in connection with the writedown of securities determined to be otti there were no  otti losses recognized in 2015 additional otti may occur in future periods as a result of market and economic conditions 

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2016  approximately 30  of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1  of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 20  of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 80  of northern trust’s assets and 97  of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment securities classified as available for sale make up 94  of level 2 assets with the remaining 6  primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2016  all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 96  measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2016  the fair value of northern trust’s level 3 assets was 47 million  level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from northern trust clients as of december 31 2016 to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities northern trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results trades and bids the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited as of december 31 2015 northern trust estimated the fair value of auction rate securities by developing and maintaining a pricing model that discounted estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model included the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trust’s own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities 

as of december 31 2016  northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million  and 10 million shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 24 “contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values 

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” asu 201409 asu 201409 is a converged standard between the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions and industries the primary objective of asu 201409 is revenue recognition that represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017

commitments letters of credit and securities lent with indemnification 

northern trust in the normal course of business enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be drawn fully upon and the client default to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit northern trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities the following table provides details of northern trust’s offbalancesheet financial instruments as of december 31 2016  and 2015

variable interest entities 

variable interest entities vies are defined within gaap as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support such as guarantees subordinated fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder if any that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vie’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 

leveraged leases  in leveraged leasing transactions northern trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds 20  30  of the asset’s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining 70  80  provided by thirdparty nonrecourse debt holders in such transactions the trusts which are vies are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership the lessee’s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property as a result northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies 

tax credit structures  northern trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities collectively community development projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits these community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which northern trust typically invests as a limited partnerinvestor member through equity contributions the economic performance of the community development projects which are vies is subject to the performance of their underlying investments and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments this power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the vies

northern trust’s liquidity management framework focuses on five key areas  position management liquidity analysis contingency planning peer group comparisons and management reporting  while also providing for the review and management of the liquidity of the corporation separate from that of the bank it is through this framework that management monitors its sources and uses of liquidity evaluates their level of stability under various circumstances plans for adverse situations benchmarks itself against other banks provides information to management and complies with various us and international regulations 

position management includes daily and intraday monitoring of cash positions anticipating future funding requirements given both internal and external events controlling and monitoring collateral positions and management of liquidity metrics such as the liquidity coverage ratio as the corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trust’s banking activities the bank centrally manages liquidity for all us and international banking operations liquidity is provided by a variety of sources including client deposits institutional and personal from the cis and wealth management businesses wholesale funding from the capital markets maturities of shortterm investments federal home loan bank advances and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity at december 31 2016  the bank had over 367 billion  of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings the bank is also active in the us interbank funding market providing an important source of additional liquidity and lowcost funds liquidity supports a variety of activities including client withdrawals purchases of securities net loan growth and draws on commitments to extend credit northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet with cash and due from banks deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks shortterm money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 66  of total assets as of december 31 2016  the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank which include those placed at the federal reserve discount window totaled 417 billion  at december 31 2016  the corporation and the bank each satisfied the us liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2016  

liquidity analysis evaluates a bank’s ability to meet its cash flow obligations given a variety of possible internal and external events and under different economic conditions northern trust uses liquidity analysis to support its contingent liquidity plans size its liquidity buffer gain insight into its liquidity position and strengthen its liquidity and management practices liquidity analysis is performed using multiple independent scenarios across major currencies at a consolidated corporate level and for various international banking subsidiaries these scenarios which include both companyspecific and systemic events analyze potential impacts on northern trust’s domestic and foreign deposit balances intraday exposures wholesale funding sources financial market access external borrowing capacity and other on and offbalancesheet obligations results are reviewed by senior management and alco on a regular basis 

another important area of northern trust’s liquidity risk management is the development and maintenance of contingent liquidity plans a contingent funding plan covering the corporation bank and major subsidiaries is approved at least once per calendar year by the business risk committee and regularly updated and tested this plan which can be activated in the event of an actual liquidity crisis details organizational responsibilities and defines specific actions designed to provide the proper maintenance of liquidity during periods of stress in conjunction with northern trust’s global contingent funding plan international banking subsidiaries also have individual contingent liquidity plans 

northern trust analyzes its liquidity profile against a peer group of large us bank holding companies including other major custody banks this analysis provides management with benchmarking information highlights industry trends and supports the establishment of new strategies 

management regularly reviews various reports analyses and other information depicting changes in northern trust’s liquidity mix and funding concentrations overall financial market conditions and other internal and external liquidity metrics management uses this information to evaluate the overall status of northern trust’s liquidity position and anticipate potential events that could stress that position in the future an overall liquidity status level for northern trust established and regularly reviewed by alco is monitored on an ongoing basis by senior management and risk oversight bodies downgrades in liquidity status resulting from internal external or industrywide events trigger specific predetermined actions and limits designed to position northern trust to respond better to potential liquidity stresses

corporation liquidity 

the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity dividend payments from the bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets in 2016  the corporation received 3000 million  of dividends from the bank dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in further detail in note 30 “restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation’s stockholders the payment of principal and interest to note holders repurchases of its common stock and investments in or loans to its subsidiaries the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2016  were 4111 million  of common stock repurchases and 3330 million  of common stock dividends 

the corporation’s liquidity defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets was 7570 million  and 7575 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively during and at yearend 2016  and 2015  these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries as needed average liquidity during 2016  and 2015  was 5628 million  and 8462 million  respectively the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 33 “northern trust corporation corporation only” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2016  provided below allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 

table 36 northern trust credit ratings as of december 31   2016   



a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 25 “derivative financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels the net maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay at december 31 2016  was 407 million  other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2016  that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings

capital management 

one of northern trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients counterparties creditors regulators and stockholders a strong capital position helps northern trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

senior management with oversight from the capital governance committee and the full board of directors is responsible for capital management and planning northern trust manages its capital on both a total corporation basis and a legal entity basis the capital committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the capital policy approved by the board of directors in establishing the metrics related to capital a variety of factors are taken into consideration including the unique risk profiles of northern trust’s businesses regulatory requirements capital levels relative to peers and the impact on credit ratings 

capital levels were strengthened in 2016  as average stockholders’ equity increased 4608 million  or 5  reaching 91 billion  total stockholders’ equity was 98 billion  at december 31 2016  as compared to 87 billion  at december 31 2015  in april 2016 the board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 6  to 038  per common share common dividends totaling 3435 million  were declared in 2016  during the year ended december 31 2016  the corporation repurchased 61 million  shares of common stock including 04 million  shares withheld related to sharebased compensation at an average price per share of 6791  in august 2016 the corporation issued series d preferred stock for net proceeds of 4935 million  preferred dividends totaling 234 million  were declared in 2016  



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with basel iii requirements capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches for each ratio the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy the following table provides a reconciliation of the corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total riskbased capital and its riskbased capital ratios under the applicable us regulatory rules as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

table 38 capital adequacy   



1 riskweighted assets exclude as applicable under each regulatory approach amounts primarily related to goodwill certain other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from tier 1 and tier 2 capital if any 

2 adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities 

3 beginning with the first quarter of 2015 advanced approaches banking organizations must calculate and report their supplementary leverage ratio effective january 1 2018 the corporation will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” under applicable us regulatory requirements further information regarding the corporation’s and 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” is provided in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 “business” and note 32 “regulatory capital requirements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2016  the corporation’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been 121  on a fully phasedin basis while the corporation’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been 115  on a fully phasedin basis 

the implementation of basel iii in the united states has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital the corporation and the bank believe their capital strength balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued us implementation of basel iii

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

risk identification and risk management process 

northern trust utilizes a risk classification system called the “risk universe” to identify and classify the risks that it inherently faces and a “risk inventory” in which such risks are defined and maintained to support granular and dynamic risk identification the risk universe and risk inventory form the basis of common risk language and provide a consistent framework for the definition and categorization of risk and the organization of risk management activities the risk universe and risk inventory support risk management at all levels and enable risks to be clearly and consistently identified categorized assessed managed and reported to line management corporate risk and committees 

as part of the integrated enterprise risk framework northern trust has established four key processes as described below 

risk appetite  northern trust defines the organization’s risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives risk appetite is a methodology to measure northern trust’s willingness to take risk and reflects northern trust’s tolerance of certain levels of risk exposures as measured at the enterprise and business level as applicable northern trust’s corporate risk appetite statement reflects northern trust’s expectation that risk is consciously considered as part of daytoday activities and strategic decisions northern trust manages its business activities consistent with the risk appetite statement in which specific guidelines are detailed for credit operational fiduciary compliance market liquidity and strategic risk communication and enforcement of the corporate risk appetite statement occurs through written policies and risk assessment processes within risk practices business units regions and legal entities supporting alignment of risktaking decisions with applicable aspects of the corporate risk appetite statement 

gerc reviews the measurement and assessment of risk within the corporation and against northern trust’s corporate risk appetite statement when appropriate gerc addresses emerging risk issues and directs risk mitigation actions 

assessment of risks  northern trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs that identify manage and measure risks in line with northern trust’s corporate risk appetite statement and guidelines risk assessments are performed on a regular basis by business risk management and facilitated by the risk management function the risk assessment process draws on the input of management staff and risk personnel across the business focusing on the inherent drivers of risk the effectiveness of controls and the resulting residual risks 

risk management embedding  risk management processes extend beyond risk assessment and measurement and are embedded in strategic and business planning and decisionmaking although the risk management function sets the direction for northern trust’s risk management activities northern trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams 

risk reporting review and communication  the risk reporting review and communication process produces risk reports that provide updates on the risk profile performance against risk guidelines and thresholds and analysis and trend information all of which highlight top and emerging risks for management and the board risk reporting includes a robust escalation process to alert senior management of significant issues 

risk control 

risk control is an internal independent review function within the risk management function risk control is managed by the chief risk control officer and is comprised of the following groups each with its own risk focus and oversight the business risk committee oversees risk control and each of the groups below 

model risk management 

financial and risk modeling are used by northern trust to inform numerous decisions regarding risk management as well as capital estimation financial reporting and disclosure valuation and pricing and portfolio management model risk may result from decisions based on models that produce incorrect results or models that are improperly used model risk management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprisewide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and revalidating existing models validations are documented and include an assessment of the conceptual soundness of the modeling approach outcomes analysis applicability of use model assumptions and limitations development documentation ongoing monitoring and model controls oversight of model risk management is provided by the mroc 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit review 

credit review provides an independent ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust the scope of credit review activities includes all clientrelated transactions that give rise to credit exposure and processes that are designed to manage or monitor such exposure credit exposure includes credit risk inherent in the entire portfolio as well as individual credits or transactions in the form of direct outstandings potential exposure and contingent liabilities that are on or offbalance sheet 

global compliance testing and independent verification 

global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities global compliance testing identifies weaknesses that could result in regulatory compliance violations or risks to northern trust’s businesses and monitors action plans designed to mitigate those weaknesses oversight of global compliance testing activities is provided by the compliance  ethics oversight committee also included is an independent verification program that promotes rigor and accuracy in northern trust’s ongoing compliance with basel iii requirements and adherence to enhanced prudential standards including liquidity stress testing the program independently verifies northern trust’s advanced systems in order to comply with the qualification requirements related to the advanced internal ratings based and advanced measurement approaches in addition independent verification performs conceptual soundness evaluations of proposed changes to the bank’s advanced systems prior to notification to regulatory authorities as required in basel coordination committee bulletin 142 the independent verification program assesses the effectiveness of the credit risk operational risk and market risk frameworks the independent verification team presents an annual assessment report of its findings to the business risk committee which is required to review and approve the effectiveness of northern trust’s advanced systems on an annual basis 

audit services 

audit services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within northern trust’s enterprise risk management framework audit services is managed by the general auditor with oversight from the audit committee audit services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the audit committee audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience including risk management expertise the general auditor reports directly to the audit committee and the corporation’s chief executive officer 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation 

credit risk overview 

credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust’s activities a significant component of credit risk relates to loans leases securities and counterpartyrelated exposures northern trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large us financial institutions as it is generally more conservative in terms of credit risk in particular northern trust is generally 

 

credit risk framework and governance 

the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk to monitor and control credit risk the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies standards and practices designed to promote a conservative credit culture this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies standards and external regulations 

the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust’s diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust these activities are designed to diversify credit exposure on an industry and client basis and reduce overall credit risk 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee 

the capital markets credit committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties 

the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework is provided by risk control 

credit risk measurement 

an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust’s internal risk rating system northern trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk northern trust uses the advanced internal rating based approach to calculate regulatory capital using regulatory formulas and exposure level risk information from northern trust’s internal rating system calculations include entityspecific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity northern trust’s internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any modeled linkage to external credit ratings 

the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system this oversight includes the development monitoring and maintenance of the models as well as providing information to the credit risk committee to support model approval and monitoring of ongoing model performance independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control 

loans and other extensions of credit 

a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the “offbalancesheet arrangements” section and in note 27 “offbalancesheet financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as part of its credit process northern trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification approval and monitoring of credit risk borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting management reporting setting of loss allowances and capital calculations borrower risk ratings are discussed further in note 6 “loans and leases” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems in addition independent from the credit risk management function credit review undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the credit risk management’s requirements 

northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures these credits which include all nonperforming credits are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default elevated risk of default or are currently in default loans outstanding to watch list borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default but have limited financial flexibility totaled 2296 million  at december 31 2016  cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements and borrowers typically have minimal cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off 

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions which in turn are derived from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust has policies in place to ensure that credit risk mitigation is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 

physical and financial collateral  northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trust’s estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collateral’s value 

netting  onbalancesheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements a subset of these arrangements are conducted under an international swaps and derivatives association credit support annex northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees  personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust may also recognize “implied support” where the commitment provided is less than that of a legally enforceable guarantee in its assignment of borrower probability of default as permitted under us supervisory guidance northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits 

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes human factors and systems or from external events 

operational risk overview 

operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties potential legal actions or catastrophes to result in losses operational risk includes 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

operational risk includes compliance fiduciary and legal risks which under the corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly 

to monitor and control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment 

northern trust’s operational risk management strategy is to 

 

the goal of these activities is to keep the operational risk profile and losses within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement and guidelines 

the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the corporatewide operational risk framework as well as business specific risk management programs to identify monitor measure and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust’s exposure to loss risk control provides independent oversight and review of the operational risk framework 

operational risk framework and governance 

the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks 

the orc is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities to identify monitor measure manage and report on operational risk in addition the orc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its programs 

operational risk is identified monitored measured managed and reported through the operational risk framework the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events several key programs support the operational risk framework including 





management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

as discussed in risk control model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework 

operational risk measurement 

northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trust’s ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital while internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification external loss event data and qualitative risk and control selfassessments are also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999 th  percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a oneyear time horizon 

information security 

northern trust’s approach to information security begins at a governance level with an organizational structure which reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across northern trust’s businesses in addition technology risk is mitigated not only through a strong governance process but also internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates the desired control environment is expressed through northern trust’s policies standards and guidelines that together define its tolerance for risk each business is responsible for complying with these policies standards and guidelines as well as external regulations where appropriate these policies standards and guidelines contain limits and benchmarks to facilitate the measurement monitoring and reporting of risk 

effective management of information and technology risk is crucial in an environment of increasing threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security and following sound technology risk management practices as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer based training in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information any findings identified are remediated following a riskbased approach 

in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization northern trust uses external third party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness these teams perform security program maturity assessments penetration tests security assessments and reviews of northern trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the business and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan

market risk 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk and market risk interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies programs and practices to keep the market risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities 

exposure limits for market risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures alco and the market and liquidity risk committee mlrc provide oversight and are responsible for developing the market risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of market risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on market risk at alco and mlrc meetings senior management reviews and discusses northern trust’s market risk profile as well as various scenario analyses alco and mlrc establish and monitor guidelines based on measures such as net interest income nii sensitivity market value of equity mve var and notional position sizes 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk is the risk to nii associated with the balance sheet or value of equity due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the market value of equity to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trust’s interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to nii even in periods of volatile interest rates 

there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk measurement reporting and analysis 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation of nii provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii simulation of mve provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability 

nii sensitivity 

the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates balance sheet changes and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in nii sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from that assumed the following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period given the low level of interest rates the simulation of nii for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

table 40 net interest income sensitivity 

the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movement for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

mve sensitivity 

mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in mve sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from the incorporated assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation 

 

the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current market implied forward rates given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero the simulation of mve for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

table 41 market value of equity sensitivity   december 31 2016   



the mve simulations do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk mve sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

interest rate risk monitoring 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of riskreturn tradeoffs a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

 

northern trust strives to use the most effective instruments for implementing its interest rate risk management strategies considering the costs liquidity collateral and capital requirements of the various alternatives and the riskreturn tradeoffs during the year ended december 31 2016 northern trust did not exceed its nii sensitivity limits or its mve sensitivity limits

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents

during 2016  and 2015  northern trust did not incur an actual trading loss in excess of the daily value at risk estimate 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 08 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps floors and swaptions an option to enter into an interest rate swap all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department when 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities 

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the longterm risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions improper implementation of business decisions unexpected external events or damage to northern trust’s reputation from negative public opinion strategic risk includes the following three subcategories 

business risk  the risk arising from the general economic conditions and external factors in which northern trust operates that could adversely affect its revenues profits and or capital 

strategy risk  the longterm risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions improper implementation of business decisions and unexpected external events and

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors 



under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act 



of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds 

another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and cftc oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities including swapdealing activities 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act has had and is expected to continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the financial stability oversight council the federal reserve board and the fdic the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that are most relevant to the corporation and its subsidiaries including the bank 

enhanced prudential standards  the doddfrank act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the enhanced prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements under the final rules the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board be subject to supervisorconducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions conduct capital stress tests implement enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework discussed below in “liquidity standards” conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event the federal reserve board also has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act 

resolution planning   as required by section 165d of the doddfrank act the federal reserve board and fdic have jointly issued a final rule requiring each us bank holding company with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company’s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition the fdic has issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in total assets including the bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution’s failure the corporation and the bank submitted resolution plans pursuant to these rules in december 2015 if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan submitted by the corporation in december 2015 pursuant to section 165d of the doddfrank act is not credible and the corporation fails to address the deficiencies in a timely manner the corporation could be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements restrictions on growth activities or operations or be required to divest certain assets or operations the corporation and the bank have and will continue to focus management attention and substantial resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning a similar directive the european union bank recovery and resolution directive brrd was adopted for european union credit institutions including certain of the bank’s subsidiaries and branches effective january 1 2015 in accordance with applicable prudential regulation authority pra guidance a recovery plan for northern trust global services limited ntgsl a uk incorporated indirect subsidiary of the bank has been prepared and will be reviewed at least annually applicable pra guidance requires institutions to produce resolution planning information in two phases in accordance with such guidance a phase 1 resolution plan for ntgsl and the bank’s london branch has been prepared and such information will be submitted to the pra every two years 

orderly liquidation authority  under the doddfrank act certain financial companies such as the corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries can be subjected to a new orderly liquidation authority for the orderly liquidation authority to apply the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must make a determination among other things that the corporation is in default or danger of default the failure of the corporation and its resolution under the us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the corporation and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects this determination must be recommended by twothirds of the fdic board of directors and twothirds of the federal reserve board absent such actions the corporation as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority became effective in july 



2010 and rulemaking is proceeding in stages if the corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority the fdic would be appointed as its receiver which would give the fdic considerable powers to resolve the corporation including 1 the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the corporation’s failure and to appoint new directors and officers 2 the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review 3 the ability to differentiate among creditors including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what such senior creditors would have received in bankruptcy liquidation and 4 broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution 

the volcker rule  the volcker rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for marketmaking hedging certain trading activities in us and foreign sovereign debt certain trading activities of nonus banking entities trading outside the united states and trading activities related to liquidity management the volcker rule also maintains significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds” such as hedge funds or private equity funds a banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds only if certain requirements are satisfied moreover a banking entity only may retain a limited ownership interest in such funds and must monitor and track investments in such covered funds carefully to ensure that the ownership interest in the fund does not exceed regulatory thresholds a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the funds or permitting the funds to use the name of the bank the volcker rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule compliance with the volcker rule generally has been required since july 21 2015 but the federal reserve board has extended the conformance period for compliance with certain portions of the prohibition against sponsoring or investing in certain legacy covered funds until july 21 2017 northern trust has conducted an enterprisewide review of affected activities taken steps to bring those activities into conformance and has established an enterprisewide compliance program to comply with the volcker rule the full impact of the volcker rule on northern trust ultimately will depend on further interpretation and guidance by the regulatory agencies responsible for its enforcement northern trust is monitoring developments with respect to the volcker rule actively and will revise further its operations and compliance programs as appropriate or required 

swaps and other derivatives  title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain derivatives activities are required to be “pushed out” of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” a “swap dealer” a “majorsecuritybased swap participant” or a “securitybased swap dealer” the cftc and sec have finalized joint rules further defining these entities and the cftc sec and other us regulators are in the process of adopting regulations to implement title vii the cftc also has finalized many rules applicable to swap dealers and other swap market participants including business conduct standards for swap dealers reporting and recordkeeping mandatory central clearing for certain swaps exchangetrading rules applicable to swaps and regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities the sec has finalized rules that among other things enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities require regulatory reporting of securitybased swap information and the public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction volume and pricing information by registered swap data repositories and define the scope of swap data repository registration requirements the scope of securitybased swap dealer and majorsecuritybased swap participant registration requirements and certain regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities it is anticipated that the sec will continue with its rulemaking process which will further clarify among other things recordkeeping obligations central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps additionally in the fall of 2015 the us banking agencies separately finalized rules requiring the posting and collection of margin by swap entities including the corporation and the bank for certain uncleared swaps as noted above the cftc and sec have yet to complete the implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop 

incentive compensation arrangements  the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions no final rule has been issued to date 

holding company support under the federal deposit insurance act 

the doddfrank act amended the federal deposit insurance act fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies such as the corporation to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this 



requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios including a severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve board the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios in evaluating a capital plan the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors consistent with prior federal reserve board guidance ccar rules provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of projected aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny the corporation’s common stock dividend payout ratio was 353  in 2015 

the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in january 2015 as part of the federal reserve board’s 2015 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporation’s plan due to a change in the capital planning schedule the corporation will submit its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve board by april 5 2016 the federal reserve board has indicated that it expects to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2016 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases by june 30 2016 the corporation anticipates announcing its proposed 2016 capital plan distributions shortly thereafter 



in addition to the ccar stress testing requirements federal reserve board regulations also include the new doddfrank act stress tests dfast the ccar and dfast requirements substantially overlap and the federal reserve board implements them at the bank holding company level on a coordinated basis under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on march 5 2015 and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on july 29 2015 

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022 

to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2015  and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios 

pursuant to the federal reserve board’s implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy 

the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2015   



in addition to the above beginning in 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions 



will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions such as the bank also will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio 

basel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 0625 in 2016 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures 

liquidity standards 

in addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr is being phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 currently northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a monthly basis daily calculation of the lcr will be required beginning in july 2016 additionally on november 24 2015 the federal reserve board proposed rules that would require large banking organizations such as the corporation to disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basis 

the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board has not yet issued a proposal to implement the nsfr 

the enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporation’s board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcr 

prompt corrective action 

the fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiary 

as noted above in december 2011 the federal reserve board issued proposed rules to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with 



total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 “early remediation requirements” similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm’s financial condition deteriorates no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to date and the final rules implementing section 165 indicate that the federal reserve board is continuing to consider the comments it received to the proposal 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

as an insured depository institution the bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the corporation as the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted the bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions including the bank these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains antimoney laundering aml and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities aml laws outside the us contain similar requirements the corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable aml laws and regulations compliance with applicable aml and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators and the corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ level of compliance with these requirements could result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 

many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions 



deposit insurance and assessments 

the bank accepts deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limit the current limit for fdic insurance for deposit accounts is 250000 for each depositor account under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency the fdic’s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions certain liquid assets are excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria this has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums due from custody banks in october 2015 the fdic proposed a surcharge assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more such as the bank in connection with the doddfrank act requirement to increase the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio from 115 to 135 without increasing the assessments of small insured depository institutions 

money market mutual funds 

on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules will occur in phases through october 2016 money market mutual fund reforms also have been proposed by the european union eu a legislative proposal for a regulation on money market mutual funds was published by the eu on april 9 2013 although the legislative process with respect to the proposed regulation is continuing and the timing of its completion remains unclear on november 25 2015 the eu adopted a regulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking the regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions and began to be phased in beginning january 12 2016 further regulation containing the technical detail of the regulation has yet to be published which will delay the effective date of certain provisions 

community reinvestment act 

the bank is subject to the community reinvestment act cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank in october 2012 the federal reserve board the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the bank’s cra compliance approved the designation of the bank as a “wholesale bank” as a result of this designation the bank fulfills its cra obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development rather than retail cra loans federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the cra the bank received an “outstanding” cra rating from the federal reserve board in its most recent cra examination 

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states and the eu have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches 

consumer laws and regulations 

the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the doddfrank act established an independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb was tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws 



nonus regulation 

northern trust’s nonus branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate for example branches and subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act 2000 they are authorized by the pra or the financial conduct authority fca and regulated by the fca and in some instances also the pra the pra and fca exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees 

northern trust’s european branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the european economic area eea moreover northern trust’s noneuropean branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of these laws given the increasing extraterritorial effect of european legislation 

on july 23 2014 the eu published a directive referred to as ucits v on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ucits v will go into effect on march 18 2016 subject to certain grandfathering provisions although secondary legislation setting out technical details and regulatory guidance with respect to ucits v have yet to be adopted ucits v will introduce rules for a depositary rules on remuneration policies for certain staff and a sanctions regime for noncompliance

 item 1a – risk factors 

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k 

market risks 

market volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions may affect our earnings negatively 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors have historically reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide such conditions also may affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which would reduce our earnings 

changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings although the federal reserve board recently raised the target federal funds rate range interest rates generally remain near historical lows the low interest rate environment that has persisted since the 20072008 global financial crisis and that may persist in 2016 and beyond has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a continued low interest rate environment also may have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example since 2009 we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings 

a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively if for example such a rise causes our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yield and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs 

further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively 

please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 



changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively 

the monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or continuing declines in oil prices and any disruptions related to such challenges may impact our earnings negatively 

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity further to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly 

volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a 



percentage of our client’s earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could impact our earnings negatively 

operational risks 

many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 

 

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate effectively these risks or we may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely 

failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary information and security breaches – including cyberattacks – could expose us to a risk of loss of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by 



or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyberthreats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients’ or other parties’ confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business 

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations 

errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to 



those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense 

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely 

in conducting our business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 29  of our revenue in 2015  our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies further it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act and the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographical diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents 



the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely 

failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact the purchase of our products and services negatively to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively 

weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of earnings negatively 

the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain in recent years the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business our financial condition and our results of operations 



liquidity risks 

if we do not effectively manage our liquidity our business could suffer 

liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits are reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively various regulations recently adopted or proposed and additional regulations under consideration impose or could impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes see “supervision and regulation—liquidity standards” in item 1 “business” any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” in item 1 “business” 

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely 

any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our 



clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 

regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 

the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations 

the doddfrank act which became law in july 2010 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies as these provisions still require final rules to be promulgated further changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise affect our business adversely these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 

changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings 

the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements ultimately could impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise affect our business and earnings adversely see “supervision and regulation” under item 1 “business” for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subject 

the implementation of money market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsors 

on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules could lower investor demand for money market mutual funds reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise affect our business earnings or financial condition adversely the implementation of these rules is occurring in phases through october 2016 

further intervention of the us and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly 

in the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these 



and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods these actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict 

we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively 

we may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters 

in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us 

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be affected adversely to the extent that our reserves are not adequate 

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth 

strategic risks 

if we do not execute strategic plans successfully we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners 



delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations 

execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied 

competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely 

we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions have resulted in a significant amount of adverse media coverage of financial institutions actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further the proliferation of social media websites utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences 



we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively 

the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 

our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can affect our earnings and growth prospects negatively 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management fiduciary and assetservicing businesses if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would affect our earnings negatively 

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 



other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively 

both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively 

changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods 

our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt   

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board through the ccar exercise and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected there can be no assurance that the federal reserve board will respond favorably to our future capital plans in addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders an objection by the federal reserve board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us 

a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely 

our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the thencurrent dividend period of our series c preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debts or elect to defer interest payments on our floating rate capital debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current 

any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock

wealth management provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses was a credit of 204 million  for 2015  compared with a provision of 02 million  in 2014  and 234 million  in 2013  the 2015  provision primarily reflected improved credit quality of commercial real estate and residential real estate loan classes coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses the 2014  provision reflected improvement in the credit quality of the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes as compared to 2013  for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses refer to the “asset quality” section 

wealth management noninterest expense 

total noninterest expense which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services totaled 129 billion  in 2015 an increase of 232 million  or 2  from 127 billion  in the prior year the increase primarily reflected higher indirect allocations primarily attributable to 92 million of the charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar nav funds allocated to wealth management as well as increased employee benefits expense partially offset by lower expense for outside services noninterest expense in 2014  included 181 million  of charges relating to severance activities and reductions in office space and writeoffs of replaced or eliminated software

table 23 treasury and other results of operations   



note stated on an fte basis 

treasury and other noninterest income in 2015  was 1079 million  compared to 66 million  in 2014  the increase reflects the 999 million  gain on the sale of 10 million visa class b common shares recognized by the corporation during 2015 excluding the gain treasury and other noninterest income increased slightly compared to 2014  noninterest income in 2014  decreased 17  from 2013 and included 42 million  of otti charges related to certain craeligible securities 

treasury and other net interest income in 2015  was 1129 million  down 759 million  or 40  from 1888 million  in 2014  the decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin partially offset by higher levels of earning assets the changes to both the net interest margin and average earning assets versus prior year are partially due to a change in presentation as certain assets were transferred to treasury and other from cis in the first quarter of 2015 and the related internal funds pricing method was updated average earning assets in 2015 increased 220 billion  to 418 billion  from 198 billion  in the prior year net interest income in 2014  increased 43  from 2013 reflecting higher internal yields on funds provided to reporting segments in 2014 

treasury and other noninterest expense in 2015  equaled 1323 million  down slightly from 1335 million  in 2014  the 2014 expense included 46 million  of severancerelated charges excluding these charges the 34 million  or 3  increase is primarily attributable to higher general overhead costs partially offset by higher indirect expense allocations to cis and wealth management

loans and leases 

the following table presents the amounts outstanding of loans and leases by segment and class as of december 31 2015  and the preceding four yearends 

table 27 composition of loan portfolio 

residential real estate 

the residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily composed of mortgages and home equity credit lines provided as an accommodation to clients residential real estate loans totaled 89 billion  at december 31 2015  or 28  of total us loans compared with 98 billion  or 32  of total us loans at december 31 2014  all residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing northern trust’s credit policies which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature such as option arm loans subprime loans loans with initial “teaser” rates and loans with excessively high loantovalue ratios residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loantocollateral value of no more than 65  to 75  at inception revaluations of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted residential real estate collateral revaluations are performed by independent third parties 

of the total 89 billion  in residential real estate loans at december 31 2015  23 billion  were in florida 20 billion  were in the greater chicago area and 15 billion  were in california with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the united states served by northern trust legally binding commitments to extend residential real estate credit which are primarily equity credit lines totaled 14 billion  and 16 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

commercial real estate 

in managing its credit exposure management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where 1 the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes 2 the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property or 3 the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds the commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction acquisition and development loans extended primarily to highly experienced developers andor investors well known to northern trust underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loantovalue ratios and debt service coverage requirements recourse to borrowers through guarantees also is commonly required 

commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of incomeproducing properties cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan these loans are primarily located in the illinois  florida  california  texas  and arizona  markets construction acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization the intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with northern trust or another financial institution upon completion

the table below provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types 

table 28 commercial real estate loans 

at december 31 2015  legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled 7509 million  and 266 million  respectively at december 31 2014  legally binding commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 5561 million  and 1107 million  respectively 

nonperforming assets and 90 days past due loans 

nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned oreo oreo is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections renegotiations and renewals the following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at december 31 2015  and each of the prior four yearends 

table 29 nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets of 1883 million  as of december 31 2015  decreased 440 million  or 19  reflecting improved credit quality across the portfolio the december 31 2015 loan portfolio reflected a reclassification of a nonperforming loan from the residential real estate loan class to the commercial and institutional loan class due to a change in the obligor as a result of restructuring the loan in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and the risk of credit losses nonperforming assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes changes in

credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and of the qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses 

allowance and provision for credit losses 

table 30 changes in the allowance for credit losses   



the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships specific loss component and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit inherent loss component 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31 2015  and at each of the prior four yearends 

table 31 allocation of the allowance for credit losses   



specific component of the allowance  the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

at december 31 2015  the specific allowance component amounted to 31 million  compared with 211 million  at the end of 2014  the 180 million  decrease is primarily attributable to chargeoffs and restructurings and payoffs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional commercial real estate and residential real estate loans 

the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from 249 million  in 2013  to 211 million  in 2014  was primarily attributable to a decrease in nonperforming loans attributable to restructurings and payoffs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional commercial real estate and residential real estate loans partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans 

inherent component of the allowance  the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans 

the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 446 million  to 2302 million  at december 31 2015  compared with 2748 million  at december 31 2014  which decreased 82 million  from 2830 million  at december 31 2013  

the decrease in 2015  was driven by improved credit quality across the loan and lease portfolio in addition northern trust changed the estimation methodology for the calculation of the inherent component of the allowance as of december 31 2015  see allowance for credit losses in critical accounting estimates on page 56 for a description of the change in estimation methodology the adoption of this methodology resulted in a reduction in the commercial and institutional allowance requirement which was partially offset by an increase to the allowance assigned to undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit the adoption of the new estimation methodology did not have a material impact on the estimated reserve for any other presented loan categories the decrease in 2014  was primarily attributable to improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans in certain markets partially offset by additional allowances established for increased loan volumes in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes 

overall allowance  the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 2333 million  at december 31 2015  compared with 2959 million  at the end of 2014  the allowance of 1938 million  assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 058  at december 31 2015  down from a 2670 million  allowance representing 084  of total loans and leases at december 31 2014  allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 395 million  and 289 million  at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

provision  the provision for credit losses was a credit of 430 million  and net chargeoffs totaled 195 million  in 2015  this compares with a 60 million  provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 180 million  in 2014  and a 200 million  provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 397 million  in 2013  

impaired loans 

a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2015  impaired loans totaled 1573 million  and included 1171 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 2422 million  at december 31 2014  which included 1513 million  of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 31 million  and 66 million  of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1 million as of december 31 2015 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards 

critical accounting estimates 

the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses pension plan accounting and otti of investment securities management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

specific allowance  the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

inherent allowance  as of december 31 2015 northern trust changed the estimation methodology for inherent losses that have been incurred in the loan and lease portfolio the new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused than the previous methodology as it is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the change in methodology is accounted for as a change in estimate applicable to current period and future periods the new estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate finance 

for periods prior to the methodology change the amount of inherent allowance was based on factors that incorporated management’s evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as management’s evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors were applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and were reviewed quarterly by the loan loss reserve committee 

the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2015 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2015  northern trust utilized a discount rate of 425  for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 425  the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 725  

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2015  measurement date the following were considered 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected qualified plan periodic pension expense in 2016  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015  the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

table 32 sensitivity of qualified pension plan assumptions   



pension contributions  the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the ppa there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2015  and 2014  due to strong asset performance over the past few years the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2016  the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 250 million for 2016  

otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities 

under gaap companies are required to perform periodic reviews of securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the declines in value are considered otherthantemporary for availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities that management has no intent to sell and believes it morelikelythannot that it will not be required to sell prior to recovery the consolidated statements of income reflect only the credit loss component of an impairment while the remainder of the fair value loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income the credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected for debt securities that northern trust intends to sell or would morelikelythannot be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis the full impairment that is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized in earnings the application of significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in assessing whether otti exists and if so in the calculation of the credit loss component of the otti assumptions used in this process are inherently subject to change in future periods different judgments or subsequent changes in estimates could result in materially different impairment loss recognition 

northern trust conducts security impairment reviews quarterly to identify and evaluate those securities within its investment portfolio that have indications of possible otti a determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is otherthantemporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security factors northern trust considers in determining whether impairment is otherthantemporary include but are not limited to the length of time the security has been impaired the severity of the impairment the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions northern trust’s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis 

there were no creditrelated losses recognized in 2015  or 2013  creditrelated losses recognized in 2014  in connection with the writedown of securities totaled 42 million  additional otti may occur in future periods as a result of market and economic conditions 

fair value measurements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2015  approximately 29  of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1  of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 18  of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 82  of northern trust’s assets and 99  of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment securities classified as available for sale make up 95  of level 2 assets with the remaining 5  primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2015  all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified in level 2 and approximately 97  measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2015  the fair value of northern trust’s level 3 assets were 171 million  level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from northern trust clients to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities for which trading is limited and market prices are generally unavailable northern trust developed and maintains a pricing model that discounts estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trust’s own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities 

as of december 31 2015  northern trust’s level 3 liabilities consisted of a swap that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 10 million  shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust pursuant to the swap northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swap also requires periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swap is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see “visa class b common shares” under note 24 “contingent liabilities” provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values

corporation liquidity 

the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity dividend payments from the bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets in 2015  the corporation received 6000 million  of dividends from the bank dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in further detail in note 30 “restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation’s stockholders the payment of principal and interest to note holders repurchases of its common stock and investments in or loans to its subsidiaries the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2015  were 4969 million  of common stock repurchases and 3214 million  of common stock dividends

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2015  provided below allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 

table 35 northern trust credit ratings as of december 31   2015   



a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 25 “derivative financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels the net maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay at december 31 2015  was 3902 million  other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2015  that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee 

the counterparty risk management committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties 

the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework is provided by risk control 

credit risk measurement 

an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust’s internal risk rating system northern trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk northern trust uses the advanced internal rating based approach to calculate regulatory capital using regulatory formulas and exposure level risk information from northern trust’s internal rating system calculations include entityspecific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity northern trust’s internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any modeled linkage to external credit ratings 

the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system this oversight includes the development monitoring and maintenance of the models as well as providing information to the credit risk committee to support model approval and monitoring of ongoing model performance independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control 

loans and other extensions of credit 

a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in note 27 “offbalancesheet financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and in the “offbalancesheet arrangements” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as part of its credit process northern trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification approval and monitoring of credit risk borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting management reporting setting of loss allowances and capital calculations borrower risk ratings are discussed further in note 6 “loans and leases” to the consolidated financial statements 

the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems in addition independent from the credit risk management function credit review undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the credit risk management’s requirements 

northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures these credits which include all nonperforming credits are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default elevated risk of default or are currently in default loans outstanding to watch list borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default but have limited financial flexibility totaled 3283 million  at december 31 2015  cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements and borrowers typically have minimal cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off 

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions which in turn are derived from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust has policies in place to ensure that credit risk mitigation is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 

physical and financial collateral  northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trust’s estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collateral’s value 

netting  onbalancesheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements a subset of these arrangements are conducted under an isda credit support annex northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

guarantees  personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust may also recognize “implied support” where the commitment provided is less than that of a legally enforceable guarantee in its assignment of borrower probability of default as permitted under us supervisory guidance northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits 

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes human factors and systems or from external events 

operational risk overview 

operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties potential legal actions or catastrophes to result in losses operational risk includes 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

operational risk includes compliance fiduciary and legal risks which under the corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly 

to monitor and control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment 

northern trust’s operational risk management strategy is to 

 

the goal of these activities is to keep the operational risk profile and losses within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement and guidelines 

the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the corporatewide operational risk framework as well as business specific risk management programs to identify monitor measure and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust’s exposure to loss risk control provides independent oversight and review of the operational risk framework 

operational risk framework and governance 

the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks 

the orc is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities to identify monitor measure manage and report on operational risk in addition the orc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its programs 

operational risk is identified monitored measured managed and reported through the operational risk framework the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events several key programs support the operational risk framework including 

 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

as discussed in risk control model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework 

operational risk measurement 

northern trust utilizes a basel ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trust’s ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital while internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification external loss data is also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process business environment and internal control factor information is used to estimate loss frequency and as an adjustment to capital estimates the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999 th  percentile over a oneyear time horizon 

information security 

northern trust’s approach to information security begins at a governance level with an organizational structure which reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across northern trust’s businesses in addition technology risk is mitigated not only through a strong governance process but also internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates the desired control environment is expressed through northern trust’s policies standards and guidelines that together define its tolerance for risk each business is responsible for complying with these policies standards and guidelines as well as external regulations where appropriate these policies standards and guidelines contain limits and benchmarks to facilitate the measurement monitoring and reporting of risk 

effective management of information and technology risk is crucial in an environment of increasing threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security and following sound technology risk management practices as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer based training in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information any findings identified are remediated following a riskbased approach 

in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization northern trust uses external third party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness these teams perform security program maturity assessments penetration tests security assessments and reviews of northern trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the business and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan 

business resiliency 

northern trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprisewide including staff technology and facilities to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes missioncritical business functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

northern trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers a highly redundant global network robust network security resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and workfromhome programs that provide further capability by allowing staff to work from home 

all of northern trust’s businesses are required to regularly riskassess their critical functions and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements people systems vendor relationships and other assets arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical thirdparty vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis all of northern trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually 

the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee 

fiduciary risk 

fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts i to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws or ii to properly discharge fiduciary duties fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction type of relationship and governing document 

fiduciary risk overview 

the fiduciary risk management program identifies assesses measures and monitors fiduciary risk fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level each business also is expected to establish procedures for enhanced review in the event a product or relationship involves unique or more complex fiduciary risks the corporate fiduciary risk program framework utilizes existing corporate and business risk management tools to measure and guide the assessment of fiduciary risk in the businesses 

  

fiduciary risk framework and governance 

the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on fiduciary risk at frc meetings senior management reviews and discusses fiduciary risks including existing and emerging issues in addition the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization 

  

compliance risk 

compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws regulations rules other regulatory requirements or codes of conduct and other standards of selfregulatory organizations applicable to northern trust compliance risk includes the following two subcategories 

 

compliance risk framework and governance 

the compliance risk management framework identifies assesses controls measures monitors and reports on compliance risk the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee

the compliance and ethics oversight committee establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust’s compliance and ethics program the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee as appropriate and chairs the compliance and ethics oversight committee 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

market risk 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in earnings and the economic value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies programs and practices to keep the market risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the corporate market risk function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities independent oversight and review of the market risk framework is provided by risk control 

exposure limits for market risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures alco and its subcommittee the market and liquidity risk committee mlrc provide independent oversight and are responsible for developing the market risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of market risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on market risk at alco and mlrc meetings senior management reviews and discusses northern trust’s market risk profile as well as various scenario analyses alco and mlrc establish and monitor guidelines based on measures such as soe seve var and notional position sizes 

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk is the risk to earnings associated with the balance sheet or value of equity due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income but it can also impact certain types of fees related to the balance sheet changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the value of equity to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trust’s interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 

there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk measurement reporting and analysis 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk soe and seve simulation of earnings provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

sensitivity of earnings soe 

the modeling of soe incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period the 100 basis point increase for example consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 83 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions 

 

the following table shows the estimated impact on the next twelve months of pretax earnings excluding fee waivers of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates given the low level of interest rates the simulation of earnings for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

table 39 interest rate risk simulation of pretax earnings excluding fee waivers 

stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that results in them becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements including money market mutual fund fee waivers for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk soe is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

during the year ended december 31 2015  northern trust did not exceed its soe limits 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

sensitivity of economic value of equity seve 

economic value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100 or 200 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions 

 

the following table shows the estimated impact on economic value of equity of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current interest rates given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero the simulation of the economic value of equity for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

table 40 interest rate risk simulation of economic value of equity as of   december 31 2015   



stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that results in them becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the simulations of economic value of equity do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk seve is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

during the year ended december 31 2015  northern trust did not exceed its seve limits 

interest rate risk monitoring 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the soe and seve simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of riskreturn tradeoffs a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

 

northern trust strives to use the most effective instruments for implementing its interest rate risk management strategies considering the costs liquidity collateral and capital requirements of the various alternatives and the riskreturn tradeoffs

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods 

foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the corporate market risk function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the corporate market risk function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk 

the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a one day horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents

during 2015  and 2014  northern trust did not incur an actual trading loss in excess of the daily value at risk estimate 

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 40 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps floors and swaptions an option to enter into an interest rate swap all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department when

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the longterm risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions improper implementation of business decisions unexpected external events or damage to northern trust’s reputation from negative public opinion strategic risk includes the following three subcategories 

business risk  the risk arising from the general economic conditions and external factors in which northern trust operates that could adversely affect its revenues profits and or capital 

strategy risk  the longterm risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions improper implementation of business decisions and unexpected external events and

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company each of the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition as a result of the amendment of the bhca by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act as discussed further below the corporation must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies as an illinois banking corporation the bank is also subject to illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area 

the bank is registered provisionally with the us commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange act as a swap dealer as a provisionally registered swap dealer the bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding swap activity and the supervision examination and enforcement power of the cftc and other regulators certain of the corporation’s other affiliates are registered with the cftc as a commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the cftc

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds 

another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and cftc oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities including swapdealing activities 

  

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act has had and is expected to continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the financial stability oversight council the federal reserve board and the fdic the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that are most relevant to the corporation and its banking subsidiaries including the bank 

  

enhanced prudential standards the doddfrank act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the enhanced prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements under the final rules which became effective january 1 2015 the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board be subject to supervisorconducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions conduct capital stress tests implement enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework discussed below in “liquidity standards” conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event the federal reserve board also has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act but these proposed rules have not yet been finalized 

resolution planning as required by the doddfrank act the federal reserve board and fdic have jointly issued a final rule requiring the corporation to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition the fdic has issued a final rule requiring the bank to submit to the 

  

  fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the bank’s failure the corporation and the bank submitted a single resolution plan that complies with these rules in december 2014 a similar directive has been adopted for european union credit institutions 

orderly liquidation authority under the doddfrank act certain financial companies such as the corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries can be subjected to a new orderly liquidation authority for the orderly liquidation authority to apply the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must make a determination among other things that the corporation is in default or danger of default the failure of the corporation and its resolution under the us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the corporation and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects this determination must be recommended by twothirds of the fdic board of directors and twothirds of the federal reserve board absent such actions the corporation as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority became effective in july 2010 and rulemaking is proceeding in stages if the corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority the fdic would be appointed as its receiver which would give the fdic considerable powers to resolve the corporation including 1 the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the corporation’s failure and to appoint new directors and officers 2 the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review 3 the ability to differentiate among creditors including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what such senior creditors would have received in bankruptcy liquidation and 4 broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution 

the volcker rule  the volcker rule became effective on july 21 2012 and in december 2013 us regulators issued final regulations to implement it in december 2013 the federal reserve board extended the conformance period for compliance with the volcker rule until july 21 2015 the federal reserve board subsequently extended the conformance period for compliance with certain portions of the prohibition against sponsoring or investing in certain private funds until july 21 2017 the volcker rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for market making hedging certain trading activities in us and foreign sovereign debt certain trading activities of nonus banking entities trading outside the united states and trading activities related to liquidity management the volcker rule also maintains the ban on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds” such as hedge funds or private equity funds while a banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds if certain conditions are met it may not acquire or retain an equity partnership or other ownership interest in such private funds except for certain limited investments a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the fund or permitting the fund to use the name of the bank the rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule northern trust is reviewing its activities affected by the final volcker rule regulations and is taking steps to bring those activities into conformity with the volcker rule northern trust also is in the process of establishing the necessary compliance programs to comply with the final volcker rule regulations the impact of the volcker rule on northern trust will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight 

swaps and other derivatives title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be “pushed out” of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” a “swap dealer” a “majorsecuritybased swap participant” or a “securitybased swap dealer” the cftc and sec have finalized joint rules further defining these entities and the cftc sec and other us regulators are in the process of adopting regulations to implement title vii the cftc has also finalized many rules applicable to swap dealers and other swap market participants including business conduct standards for swap dealers reporting and recordkeeping mandatory central clearing for certain swaps exchangetrading rules applicable to swaps and regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities the sec has finalized rules that among other things enhance the oversight of clearing and trading 

  

  entities require regulatory reporting of securitybased swap information and the public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction volume and pricing information by registered swap data repositories and define the scope of swap data repository registration requirements and certain regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities it is anticipated that the sec will continue with its rulemaking process which will further clarify among other things recordkeeping obligations the scope of securitybased swap dealer and majorsecuritybased swap participant registration requirements central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps the cftc and sec have yet to complete the implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop 

incentive compensation arrangements the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions no final rule has been issued to date 

  

holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions 

the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies such as the corporation to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress 

  

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

  

  capital planning and stress testing 

the corporation’s capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios and a tier 1 common to riskweighted assets ratio of at least 5 calculated under general riskbased capital rules as currently in effect in each case on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios including a severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve board the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a tier 1 common to riskweighted assets ratio of at least 5 

the purpose of ccar is to ensure that these bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the ccar rule consistent with prior federal reserve board guidance provides that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of projected aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny the corporation’s common stock dividend payout ratio was 392 in 2014 

the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in january 2014 as part of the federal reserve board’s 2014 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporation’s plan in january 2015 the corporation submitted its 2015 capital plan to the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has indicated that it expects to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2015 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases on march 11 2015 the corporation anticipates announcing its proposed 2015 capital plan distributions shortly thereafter 

in addition to the ccar stress testing requirements federal reserve board regulations also include the new doddfrank act stress tests dfast the ccar and dfast requirements substantially overlap and the federal reserve board implements them at the bank holding company level on a coordinated basis under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporation’s and the bank’s annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on march 20 2014 and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on september 17 2014 

  

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation as of january 1 2015 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of 

  

  central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022 

the federal banking regulators also have established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2014 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators 

under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank were required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014 

pursuant to the federal reserve board’s implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy under the prompt corrective action framework described further below 

the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

  

table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2014 

  

   

1 effective january 1 2015 the applicable minimum common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 45 60 and 8 respectively 

2 effective january 1 2015 the applicable minimum common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios to be considered “wellcapitalized” are 65 80 and 100 respectively 

  

in addition to the above beginning in 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio which the federal reserve board finalized in 2014 under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institution subsidiaries of advanced approaches institutions such as the bank will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “wellcapitalized” under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio 

basel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 0625 in 2016 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the 

  

  amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures 

the us’s implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital however the corporation and the bank believe their capital strength balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued us implementation of basel iii 

  

liquidity standards 

in addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr will be phased in beginning on january 1 2015 at 80 with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 beginning with january 2015 northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a monthly basis daily calculation of the lcr will be required beginning with july 2016 the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board has not yet issued a proposal to implement the nsfr 

in march 2014 the federal reserve board issued enhanced prudential standards which specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank effective january 1 2015 these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the board of directors also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcr 

  

prompt corrective action 

the fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiary 

as noted above in december 2011 the federal reserve board issued proposed rules to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 “early remediation requirements” similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm’s financial condition deteriorates no final rule 

  

  implementing section 166 has been issued to date and the final rules implementing section 165 indicate that the federal reserve board is continuing to consider the comments it received to the proposal 

  

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

the corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders

 item 1a – risk factors 

  

in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect us we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face 

these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “forwardlooking statements” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k 

  

market risks 

a downturn in economic conditions such as the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and resultant economic turmoil may negatively affect our earnings 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market value of assets under management or custody securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be negatively impacted by a downturn in economic conditions for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments as a result of market disruption illiquidity or other factors have historically reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally reduced our earnings weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for our trust and investment products and services reduced transaction volumes would also generally negatively impact our earnings economic weakness may also affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which would reduce our earnings 

  

changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings rates that remain persistently low may reduce our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a low interest rate environment can also reduce fees earned on certain of our products for example since 2009 we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively impact our earnings please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face 

  

changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects 

the monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds 

  

  for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the eu the risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings 

there remain ongoing concerns about the ability of certain european countries to finance their deficits and service their debt burdens risks and ongoing concerns about the financial stability of these countries could have a detrimental impact on the continued global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions european market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices continuing economic challenges in europe including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions and related disruptions may negatively impact our earnings 

  

declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings 

our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represents a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular to the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination 

  

volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings 

we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income 

we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods 

we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may negatively impact earnings please see “market risk” in the “risk management” section included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face 

  

changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings 

in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities 

  

  may be negatively affected in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could negatively impact our earnings 

  

operational risks 

many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings 

we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include 

           

while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate effectively these risks if they do not such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be adversely impacted 

  

the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face 

we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which could ultimately have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences 

  

  errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways 

in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for us that involve very large amounts of money failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected 

  

our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses 

our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to among other things record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs also could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

  

breaches of our security measures may result in losses 

any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary information and security breaches – including cyberattacks – could expose us to a risk of loss of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to appropriately conduct our business activities 

the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not suffered a material breach of our systems it is possible that we could suffer such a breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyber threats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients’ or other parties’ confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets operations and activities if an actual or perceived breach of our 

  

  security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients 

  

our reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss or disclosure of our or our clients’ information 

the secure maintenance and transmission of client information is a critical element of our operations our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit client information or those of service providers or business partners may be impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a thirdparty service provider or business partner or by a security breach as a result our clients’ information may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without the clients’ consent any such loss disclosure or access to clients’ information can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

inability of our internal controls to keep pace with our expansion may result in losses 

in recent years we have expanded our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types a failure to put controls in place to mitigate new risks associated with this expansion may disrupt our operations resulting in losses 

  

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement other expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud 

  

failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses 

thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could also create significant delay and expense 

  

we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may adversely affect our business 

in conducting our business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 31 of our revenue in 2014 our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies further it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in 

  

  various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to properly mitigate such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery 

in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act and the uk bribery act while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographical diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations or laws and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation 

  

failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our earnings 

our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy including innovation we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could negatively affect our earnings 

  

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties these events could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may negatively impact economic growth which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

  

credit risks 

failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would directly and negatively affect earnings 

  

  weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings 

credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn negatively impact our financial condition and results of earnings 

  

the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss 

the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain in recent years the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations 

  

liquidity risks 

if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see “supervision and regulation—payment of dividends” in item 1 “business” 

  

we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms 

we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals 

  

  any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could adversely affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity 

rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratings agencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business 

the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients’ behalf will be materially compromised if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly 

  

our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to successfully manage the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow 

  

regulatory and legal risks 

failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings 

virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations similarly failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations 

the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 made a number of significant regulatory and compliance changes there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies as some provisions still require final rules to be promulgated further changes 

  

  resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our business these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 

  

changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings 

the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements could ultimately impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise adversely affect our business and earnings see “supervision and regulation” under item 1 “business” for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subject 

  

the implementation of money market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsors 

on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise adversely affect our business earnings or financial condition the implementation of these rules will occur in phases from july 2015 through october 2016 

  

further intervention of the us and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly 

in recent years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws home mortgage lending and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods these actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and would likely involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict 

  

our business may be adversely impacted by litigation and regulatory enforcement 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk actions brought against us may result in injunctions settlements 

  

  damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently negatively affecting our earnings 

in the ordinary course of our business we also are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us in enforcement matters claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible 

  

we may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability with a negative effect on our earnings 

we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate 

  

if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could negatively affect our earnings 

managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses failure to comply with these standards adequately manage these risks or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability 

  

strategic risks 

if we do not successfully execute strategic plans we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted 

our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will negatively impact growth a failure to grow organically or to successfully integrate an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems 

  

competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could adversely affect our clients’ perception of our abilities 

  

  we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large in some cases wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures these competitive pressures may negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

  

damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue 

damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could negatively affect our earnings damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business the global financial crisis of 200708 and current political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions have resulted in a significant amount of adverse media coverage of financial institutions actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry could also negatively impact our reputation 

  

we need to constantly invest in innovation and the inability or failure to do so may negatively affect our businesses and earnings 

our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities growth and earnings there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all 

  

failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively affect our businesses and earnings 

our success in capitalizing on innovation depends in part on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings 

  

  our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

  

failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management fiduciary and assetservicing businesses if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would negatively affect our earnings 

  

we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings 

we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted 

  

other risks 

changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may negatively affect our earnings 

both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings 

in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings 

  

  changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards resulting both from initiatives of the financial accounting standards board or its convergence efforts with the international accounting standards board as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods

wealth management net interest income 

net interest income was 5361 million for 2014 down 216 million or 4 from 5577 million in 2013 primarily reflecting a decline in the net interest margin partially offset by higher levels of average earning assets the wealth management net interest margin in 2014 decreased to 232 from 246 in 2013 resulting from lower yields on earning assets partially offset by lower deposit rates each reflecting the persistent low interest rate environment average earning assets totaled 231 billion in the current year a 2 increase from 226 billion in the prior year net interest income in 2013 declined 722 million or 11 from 2012 and the net interest margin in 2013 of 246 was down from the 2012 margin of 267 the lower net interest margin in 2013 as compared to 2012 was attributable to lower yields on earning assets partially offset by lower deposit rates earning assets and funding sources in both 2014 and 2013 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interestbearing deposits respectively 

  

wealth management provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses totaled 02 million for 2014 compared with 234 million in 2013 and 271 million in 2012 the 2014 provision primarily reflected improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate and residential real estate loan classes the 2013 provision reflected improvement in the credit quality of the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes as compared to 2012 but weakness in the credit quality of the residential real estate loan class for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses refer to the “asset quality” section

treasury and other noninterest income in 2014 was 66 million compared to 80 million in 2013 and included 42 million of otti charges related to certain craeligible securities excluding these charges treasury and other noninterest income increased 35 from 2013 primarily attributable to gains from currencyrelated hedging activities in 2014 noninterest income in 2013 increased 14 from 2012 and included higher security commissions and trading income as compared to 2012 other noninterest income in 2012 included a 53 million hedgerelated gain as well as creditrelated otti losses of 33 million 

treasury and other net interest income in 2014 was 1888 million up 568 million or 43 from 1320 million in 2013 the increase is primarily due to higher internal yields on funds provided to reporting segments in the current year net interest income in 2013 increased 109 million or 9 from 1211 million in 2012 primarily due to higher internal yields on funds provided to business units in 2013

require a loantocollateral value of no more than 65 to 80 at inception revaluations of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted residential real estate collateral revaluations are performed by independent third parties 

of the total 98 billion in residential real estate loans at december 31 2014 30 billion were in the greater chicago area 22 billion were in florida and 16 billion were in california with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the us served by northern trust legally binding commitments to extend residential real estate credit which are primarily equity credit lines totaled 16 billion and 17 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

commercial real estate 

in managing its credit exposure management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where 1 the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes 2 the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property or 3 the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds the commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction acquisition and development loans extended primarily to highly experienced developers andor investors well known to northern trust underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loantovalue ratios and debt service coverage requirements recourse to borrowers through guarantees is also commonly required 

commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of incomeproducing properties cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan these loans are primarily located in the illinois florida california texas and arizona markets construction acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization the intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with northern trust or another financial institution upon completion 

the table below provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types 

  

   

at december 31 2014 legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled 5561 million and 1107 million respectively at december 31 2013 legally binding commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 4482 million and 971 million respectively

accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections renegotiations and renewals the following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at december 31 2014 and each of the prior four year ends 

  

   

nonperforming assets of 2323 million as of december 31 2014 reflect improved credit quality from the prior year though they remain elevated from levels preceding the economic downturn of 2008 and its impact on residential property valuations and general economic conditions the december 31 2014 loan portfolio reflected improvement in the credit quality of the residential real estate commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and the risk of credit losses nonperforming assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and of the qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses 

  

allowance and provision for credit losses 

  

   

the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships specific loss component and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit inherent loss component 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31 2014 and at each of the prior four yearends 

  

table 29 allocation of the allowance for credit losses 

   

specific component of the allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay 

at december 31 2014 the specific allowance component amounted to 211 million compared with 249 million at the end of 2013 the 38 million decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in nonperforming loans attributable to restructurings and payoffs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional commercial real estate and residential real estate loans partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans 

the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from 325 million in 2012 to 249 million in 2013 was primarily attributable to chargeoffs and payoffs partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans 

  

inherent component of the allowance the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the amount of the inherent loss allowance is based on factors which incorporate management’s evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as management’s evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the historical chargeoff experience for each loan category is based on data from the current and preceding three years qualitative factors reviewed by management include changes in asset quality metrics the nature and volume of the portfolio economic and business conditions and collateral valuations such as property values as well as other pertinent information changes in collateral values delinquency ratios portfolio volume and concentration and other asset quality metrics including management’s subjective evaluation of economic and business conditions result in adjustments of qualitative allowance factors that are applied in the determination of inherent allowance requirements 

the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans 

the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 82 million to 2748 million at december 31 2014 compared with 2830 million at december 31 2013 which decreased 121 million from 2951 million at december 31 2012 the decrease in 2014 is primarily attributable to improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans in certain markets partially offset by additional allowances established for increased loan volumes in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes the decrease in 2013 reflected improvement in the credit quality of commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loans in certain markets as compared to 2012 

  

overall allowance the evaluation of the factors above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 2959 million at december 31 2014 compared with 3079 million at the end of 2013 the allowance of 2670 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 084 at december 31 2014 down from a 2781 million allowance representing 095 of total loans and leases at december 31 2013 allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 289 million and 298 million at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

  

provision the provision for credit losses was 60 million and net chargeoffs totaled 180 million in 2014 this compares with a 200 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 397 million in 2013 and a 250 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 263 million in 2012 

  

impaired loans 

a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2014 impaired loans totaled 2422 million and included 1513 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 2934 million at december 31 2013 which included 1625 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 66 million and 104 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 250000 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust’s future financial condition and results of operations 

for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses pension plan accounting and otti of investment securities management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board 

  

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures 

the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components 

  

specific allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral 

  

inherent allowance the amount of inherent allowance is based on factors which incorporate management’s evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as management’s evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors are applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and are reviewed quarterly by northern trust’s loan loss reserve committee which includes representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financial management 

the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff as described in the “asset quality” section are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trust’s own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate 

loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs 

management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2014 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 

additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 

  

pension plan accounting 

northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods 

northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets 

in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2014 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 500 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 775 

in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trust’s december 31 2014 measurement date the following were considered 

      

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

   

in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected qualified plan periodic pension expense in 2015 and the projected benefit obligation the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points 

  

   

pension contributions the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “target liability” under the provisions of the ppa there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2014 and 2013 due to strong asset performance over the past few years the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2015 and for several years thereafter the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at 1500 million for 2015 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities 

under gaap companies are required to perform periodic reviews of securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the declines in value are considered otherthantemporary for availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities that management has no intent to sell and believes it morelikelythannot that it will not be required to sell prior to recovery the consolidated statement of income reflects only the credit loss component of an impairment while the remainder of the fair value loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income the credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected for debt securities that northern trust intends to sell or would morelikelythannot be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis the full impairment that is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized in earnings the application of significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in assessing whether an otti exists and if so in the calculation of the credit loss component of the otti assumptions used in this process are inherently subject to change in future periods different judgments or subsequent changes in estimates could result in materially different impairment loss recognition 

northern trust conducts security impairment reviews quarterly to identify and evaluate those securities within its investment portfolio that have indications of possible otti a determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is otherthantemporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security factors northern trust considers in determining whether impairment is otherthantemporary include but are not limited to the length of time the security has been impaired the severity of the impairment the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions northern trust’s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

creditrelated losses recognized in 2014 and 2012 in connection with the writedown of securities totaled 42 million and 33 million respectively there were no creditrelated losses recognized in 2013 additional otti may occur in future periods as a result of market and economic conditions 

  

fair value measurements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value as of december 31 2014 approximately 29 of northern trust’s total assets and approximately 1 of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 14 of northern trust’s assets carried at fair value is classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange 

approximately 86 of northern trust’s assets and 100 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment securities classified as available for sale make up 917 of level 2 assets with the remaining 83 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments 

northern trust’s level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of december 31 2014 all derivative assets and liabilities were classified in level 2 and approximately 97 measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material 

as of december 31 2014 the fair value of northern trust’s level 3 assets were 181 million and represented approximately 01 of assets carried at fair value level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from northern trust clients to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities for which trading is limited and market prices are generally unavailable northern trust developed and maintains a pricing model that discounts estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trust’s own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities as of december 31 2014 northern trust had no level 3 liabilities 

while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values

liquidity and capital resources 

  

liquidity risk management 

the objectives of liquidity risk management are to ensure that northern trust can meet its cash flow obligations under both normal and adverse economic conditions while maintaining its ability to capitalize on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds to meet on and offbalance sheet cash flow obligations when they are due and payable because of firmspecific or marketwide events 

  

governance and risk management framework 

northern trust manages its liquidity under a global risk management framework incorporating regional policies limits and management when appropriate corporate liquidity policies risk appetite and limits are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors in connection with the implementation of enhanced prudential standards in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position the business risk committee receives reports at least quarterly on the corporation’s liquidity risk profile and liquidity risk tolerance the asset  liability management policy committee alco is responsible for recommending liquidity policies to the board establishing internal liquidity thresholds assessing northern trust’s overall liquidity status and reviewing reports including liquidity stress test results cash flows and other analyses on a regular basis the treasury department has the daytoday responsibility for measuring analyzing and managing liquidity risk within the thresholds and limits established by alco and the board 

northern trust’s global liquidity management framework focuses on five key areas – position management liquidity analysis contingency planning peer group comparisons and management reporting – while also providing for the review and management of the liquidity of the corporation separate from that of the bank it is through this framework that management monitors its sources and uses of liquidity evaluates their level of stability under various circumstances plans for adverse situations benchmarks itself against other banks provides information to management and complies with various us and international regulations 

position management includes daily monitoring of cash positions and anticipating future funding requirements given both internal and external events as the corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trust’s banking activities the bank centrally manages liquidity for all us and international banking operations liquidity is provided by a variety of sources including client deposits institutional and personal from our cis and wealth management businesses wholesale funding from the capital markets maturities of shortterm investments federal home loan bank advances and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity at december 31 2014 the bank had over 255 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings the bank is also very active in the us interbank funding market providing an important source of additional liquidity and lowcost funds liquidity is used by a variety of activities including client withdrawals purchases of securities net loan growth and draws on commitments to extend credit northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet with cash and due from banks deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks shortterm money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 64 of total assets as of december 31 2014 the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank which include those placed at the federal reserve discount window totaled 293 billion at december 31 2014 

liquidity analysis evaluates a bank’s ability to meet its cash flow obligations given a variety of possible internal and external events and under different economic conditions northern trust uses liquidity analysis to support its contingent liquidity plans size its liquidity buffer gain insight into its liquidity position and strengthen its liquidity policies and practices liquidity analysis is performed using multiple independent scenarios across major currencies at a consolidated corporate level and for various international banking subsidiaries these scenarios which include both company specific and systemic events analyze potential impacts on northern trust’s domestic and foreign deposit balances wholesale funding sources financial market access external borrowing capacity and offbalancesheet obligations results are reviewed by senior management and alco on a regular basis 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

another important area of northern trust’s liquidity risk management is the development and maintenance of its contingent liquidity plans a contingent funding plan covering the corporation bank and major subsidiaries is approved annually by the business risk committee and regularly updated and tested this plan which can be activated in the event of an actual liquidity crisis details organizational responsibilities and defines specific actions designed to ensure the proper maintenance of liquidity during periods of stress in addition international banking subsidiaries have individual contingent liquidity plans which reflect the global plan 

northern trust also analyzes its liquidity profile against a peer group of large us bank holding companies including other major custody banks this analysis provides management with benchmarking information highlights industry trends and supports the establishment of new policies and strategies 

management regularly reviews various reports analyses and other information depicting changes in northern trust’s liquidity mix and funding concentrations overall financial market conditions and other internal and external liquidity metrics management uses this information to evaluate the overall status of northern trust’s liquidity position and anticipate potential events that could stress that position in the future an overall liquidity status level for northern trust established and regularly reviewed by alco is monitored on an ongoing basis by the treasury department downgrades in liquidity status resulting from internal external or industrywide events trigger specific predetermined actions and limits designed to position northern trust to better respond to potential liquidity stresses 

  

corporation liquidity 

the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity dividend payments from the bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets in 2014 the corporation issued series c preferred stock for net proceeds of 3885 million and received 3000 million of dividends from the bank dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in further detail in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation’s stockholders the payment of principal and interest to note holders repurchases of its common stock and investments in or loans to its subsidiaries the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2014 were debt repayments of 5000 million related to the may 2014 maturity of 463 fixed rate senior notes 4807 million of common stock repurchases and 3029 million of common stock dividends 

the corporation’s liquidity defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets was 8694 million and 16 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively during and at yearend 2014 and 2013 these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiary companies as needed average liquidity during 2014 and 2013 was 11 billion and 17 billion respectively the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31 2014 provided below allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms 

  

   

a significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit northern trust’s access to capital markets andor increase the rates paid for shortterm borrowings including deposits and future longterm debt issuances the size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors including the extent of the downgrade northern trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels the maximum amount of these termination payments that northern trust could have been required to pay at december 31 2014 was 266 million other than these creditriskrelated contingent derivative counterparty payments northern trust had no longterm debt covenants or other creditriskrelated payments at december 31 2014 that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings 

  

statement of cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 9360 million primarily the result of period earnings inclusive of the impact of noncash charges such as amortization of computer software partially offset by increased net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013 was 8393 million and was primarily the result of period earnings inclusive of the impact of noncash charges partially offset by increases in net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties and in receivables 

net cash used in investing activities of 82 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to increased levels of federal reserve deposits net purchases of securities held to maturity and available for sale and increased levels of loans and leases partially offset by decreased levels of interestbearing deposits with banks the net increase in investment securities and the decrease in interestbearing deposits with banks primarily reflected the redeployment of investments in bank time deposits to securities the increase in federal reserve deposits primarily reflected increases in demand and other noninterestbearing client deposits in 2014 

net cash used in investing activities of 57 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in federal reserve deposits primarily reflecting increased levels of nonusoffice interestbearing client deposits and shortterm other borrowings 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 71 billion primarily attributable to increased levels of total deposits and proceeds from the issuance of series c preferred stock partially offset by repayments of senior notes and other longterm debt the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation’s share repurchase program and cash dividends paid to common stockholders the increase in total deposits is attributable to higher levels of demand and other noninterestbearing client deposits the decreases in senior notes and other longterm debt reflect the maturity of 5000 million of fixedrate senior notes and 1350 million of repayments of borrowings from the federal home loan bank respectively 

for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 44 billion primarily reflecting increased levels of total deposits and shortterm other borrowings the increase in the level of total deposits was primarily due to an increase in nonusoffice interestbearing client deposits partially offset by decreased usoffice demand and other noninterestbearing client deposits from december 31 2012 levels the decrease in usoffice noninterestbearing deposits was largely driven by the expiration on december 31 2012 of the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program which had provided unlimited deposit insurance the increase in shortterm other borrowings in 2013 reflected additional shortterm borrowings from the federal home loan bank 

  

regulatory environment

northern trust manages its capital on a total corporation basis and on a legal entity basis the treasury department has the daytoday responsibility for measuring and managing capital levels within goals and targets established by the capital management policy and the board the management of capital also involves regional management when appropriate in establishing the goals and targets for capital a variety of factors are taken into consideration including the overall risk of northern trust’s businesses regulatory requirements capital levels relative to its peers and the impact on its credit ratings 

capital levels were strengthened in 2014 as average stockholders’ equity increased 4995 million or 7 reaching 82 billion total stockholders’ equity was 84 billion at december 31 2014 as compared to 79 billion at december 31 2013 in april 2014 the board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 6 to 033 per common share common dividends totaling 3117 million were declared in 2014 the corporation purchased 75 million shares of its own common stock in 2014 at an average price per share of 6420 and is authorized by the board to purchase up to 71 million additional shares of stock after december 31 2014 the corporation issued series c preferred stock for net proceeds of 3885 million in august 2014 and in october 2014 declared 95 million of dividends to preferred stockholders payable january 1 2015 and covering the fivemonth period from august through december 2014 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

in accordance with basel iii requirements in effect at december 31 2014 capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches for each ratio the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy the following table provides a reconciliation of the corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total riskbased capital and its riskbased capital ratios under the applicable us regulatory rules as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

   

1 riskweighted assets exclude as applicable under each regulatory approach amounts primarily related to goodwill certain other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from tier 1 and tier 2 capital if any 

2 adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill other intangible assets and net unrealized gains or losses on securities 

3 effective with the second quarter of 2014 northern trust exited its parallel run accordingly the december 31 2014 capital balances and ratios are calculated in compliance with the basel iii advanced approach final rules released by the federal reserve board on july 2 2013 

4 standardized approach capital components in 2014 are determined by basel iii phased in requirements and risk weighted assets are determined by basel i requirements the december 31 2014 ratios calculated under the standardized approach comply with the final rules released by the federal reserve board on july 2 2013 

5 the december 31 2013 capital balances and ratios were calculated in accordance with basel i requirements 

  

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” under applicable us regulatory requirements further information regarding the corporation’s and the bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as “wellcapitalized” is provided in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 “business” and note 32 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the parallel run of the riskbased capital framework demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches methodologies inclusive of commitments the corporation provided to the federal reserve board regarding the corporation’s approach to the calculation of riskweighted assets did not result in tier 1 or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as “wellcapitalized” as of december 31 2014 the corporation’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been 119 on a fully phasedin basis while the corporation’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been 105 on a fully phasedin basis 

the us’s implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital the corporation and the bank believe their capital strength balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued us implementation of basel iii

risk identification and risk management process 

northern trust utilizes a risk classification system called the “risk universe” to identify and classify the risks that it inherently faces the risk universe forms the basis of common risk language and provides a consistent framework for the definition and categorization of risk and the organization of risk management activities the risk universe supports risk management at all levels and enables risks to be clearly and consistently identified categorized assessed managed and reported to line management corporate risk and committees the risk universe is reviewed and approved at least annually by gerc and the board of directors 

as part of the integrated enterprise risk framework northern trust has established four key processes as described below 

  

risk appetite northern trust defines the organization’s risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives risk appetite is a tool to measure northern trust’s willingness to take risk and reflects northern trust’s tolerance of certain levels of risk exposures as measured at the enterprise and business level as applicable northern trust’s corporate risk appetite statement is established by senior management and reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors the corporate risk appetite statement reflects northern trust’s expectation that risk is consciously considered as part of daytoday activities and strategic decisions northern trust manages its business activities consistent with the risk appetite statement in which specific guidelines are detailed for credit operational fiduciary compliance market liquidity and strategic risk gerc reviews the measurement and assessment of risk within the corporation and against northern trust’s corporate risk appetite statement when appropriate gerc addresses emerging risk issues and directs risk mitigation actions 

  

assessment of risks northern trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs that identify manage and measure risks risk assessments are performed on a regular basis by business risk management and facilitated by the risk management function the risk assessment process draws on the input of management staff and risk personnel across the business focusing on the inherent drivers of risk the effectiveness of controls and the resulting residual risks

risk reporting review and communication the risk reporting review and communication process produces risk reports that provide updates on the risk profile performance against risk guidelines and thresholds and analysis and trend information all of which highlight top and emerging risks for management and the board risk reporting includes a robust escalation process to alert senior management of significant issues

credit risk framework and governance 

the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk management framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive credit risk management this function approves policies establishes the credit risk framework and monitors adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures credit risk management reports directly to the cro independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework is provided by risk control 

the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust’s diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust these activities are designed to diversify credit exposure on an industry and client basis and reduce overall credit risk 

the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credits exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee 

the counterparty risk management committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties 

  

credit risk measurement 

an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust’s internal risk rating system northern trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk northern trust uses the advanced internal ratingbased approach to calculate regulatory capital using regulatory formulas and exposure level risk information from northern trust’s internal rating system calculations include entityspecific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity northern trust’s internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any modeled linkage to external credit ratings 

the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system this includes the development monitoring and maintenance of the models as well as providing information to the credit risk management committee to support model approval and monitoring of ongoing model performance independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control 

  

loans and other extensions of credit 

a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and in the “offbalancesheet arrangements” section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as part of its credit process northern trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification approval and monitoring of credit risk borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting management reporting setting of loss allowances and economic capital calculations borrower risk ratings are discussed further in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems in addition independent from the credit risk management function credit review as part of risk control undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the credit risk management’s requirements 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for credits with borrower ratings of “6 to 9” these credits which include all nonperforming credits are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default elevated risk of default or are currently in default loans outstanding to watch list borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default but have limited financial flexibility totaled 4212 million at december 31 2014 cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements and borrowers typically have minimal cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off 

  

counterparty credit risk 

counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions which in turn are derived from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor 

to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity 

  

credit risk mitigation 

northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust has policies in place to ensure that credit risk mitigation is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories 

  

physical and financial collateral northern trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trust’s estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collateral’s value 

  

netting onbalance sheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements a subset of these arrangements are conducted under an isda credit support annex northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

  

guarantees personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust’s claims relative to other creditors northern trust may also recognize “implied support” where the commitment provided is less than that of a legally enforceable guarantee in its assignment of borrower probability of default as permitted under us supervisory guidance northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits 

  

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events 

  

operational risk overview 

operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties or catastrophes to result in unexpected losses operational risk includes 

            

operational risk includes compliance fiduciary and legal risks which under the corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly 

to monitor and control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment 

northern trust’s operational risk management strategy is to 

      

the goal of these activities is to keep the operational risk profile and losses within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement and guidelines 

the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the corporatewide operational risk framework as well as business specific risk management programs to identify monitor measure and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust’s exposure to loss risk control provides independent oversight and review 

  

operational risk framework and governance 

the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

orc is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and approving the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities to identify monitor measure manage and report on operational risk in addition orc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its programs 

operational risk is identified monitored measured managed and mitigated through the operational risk framework the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events several key programs support the operational risk framework including 

              

operational risk measurement 

northern trust utilizes a basel ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trust’s ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital while internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification external loss data is also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process business environment and internal control factor information is used to estimate loss frequency and as an adjustment to capital estimates the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999 th percentile over a oneyear time horizon

information security 

northern trust’s approach to information security begins at a governance level with its organizational structure and support from executive management and risk committees comprising members from across the business in addition technology risk is mitigated not only through a strong governance process but also internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates the desired control environment is expressed through northern trust’s policies standards and guidelines that together define its tolerance for risk each business is responsible for complying with these policies standards and guidelines as well as external regulations where appropriate these policies standards and guidelines contain limits and benchmarks to facilitate the measurement monitoring and reporting of risk 

effective management of information and technology risk is crucial in an environment of increasing threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security and following sound technology risk management practices as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer based training in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information any findings identified are remediated following a riskbased approach both swiftly and thoroughly 

in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization northern trust uses external third party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness these teams perform penetration tests security reviews and susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing northern trust also employs an externally managed threat identification and alert system this system aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the business and alerts the organization to threats northern trust maintains a cyber incident response plan that is followed in response to identified threats 

  

business resiliency 

northern trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprisewide including staff technology and facilities to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes missioncritical business functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements 

northern trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers a highly redundant worldwide network robust network security resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations transfer of work and workfromhome programs that provide further capability by allowing staff to work from home 

all of northern trust’s businesses are required to regularly riskassess their critical functions and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements people systems and other assets arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards all businesses test their plans at least annually 

orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee 

  

fiduciary risk 

fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts i to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws or ii to properly discharge fiduciary duties fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction type of relationship and governing document 

  

fiduciary risk overview 

the fiduciary risk management program identifies assesses measures and monitors fiduciary risk fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify understand and keep such risk at levels 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations for establishing specific policies standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level and as specifically appropriate for each fiduciary relationship and for establishing procedures for enhanced review in the event a product or relationship involves either unique or more complex fiduciary risks the corporate fiduciary risk program framework utilizes existing corporate and business risk management tools to measure and guide the assessment of fiduciary risk in the businesses 

  

fiduciary risk framework and governance 

the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on fiduciary risk at frc senior management reviews and discusses fiduciary risks including existing and emerging issues in addition frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees 

  

compliance risk 

compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws regulations rules other regulatory requirements or codes of conduct and other standards of selfregulatory organizations applicable to northern trust compliance risk includes the following two subcategories 

    

compliance risk framework and governance 

the compliance risk management framework identifies assesses controls measures monitors and reports on compliance risk the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee 

each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses each business is responsible for its respective partners’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust’s compliance and ethics program 

the compliance and ethics oversight committee establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust’s compliance and ethics program the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee as appropriate and chairs the compliance and ethics oversight committee 

  

market risk 

there are two types of market risk interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in earnings and the economic value of equity trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions 

  

market risk framework and governance 

northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies programs and practices to keep the market risk profile within the boardapproved corporate risk appetite statement all market risk activities are overseen by the corporate market risk function which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities independent oversight and review of the market risk framework is provided by risk control 

  

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

exposure limits for market risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures alco provides independent oversight and is responsible for developing the market risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of market risk activities to identify monitor manage and report on market risk at alco senior management reviews and discusses northern trust’s market risk profile as well as various scenario analyses alco establishes and monitors guidelines based on measures such as simulation of earnings soe sensitivity of economic value of equity seve value at risk var and notional position sizes 

the market risk framework components of risk monitoring risk reporting and analysis and risk measurement are discussed below 

  

interest rate risk overview 

interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or common capital due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income but it can also impact certain types of fees changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the value of capital to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trust’s interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 

there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk 

      

interest rate risk measurement reporting and analysis 

northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk soe and seve simulation of earnings provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability 

  

sensitivity of earnings soe 

the modeling of soe incorporates onbalance sheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period the 100 basis point increase for example consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 83 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions 

    

  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

      

the following table shows the estimated impact on the next twelve months of pretax earnings of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates given the low level of interest rates the simulation of earnings for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

  

table 37 interest rate risk simulation of pretax earnings 

  

   

stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that results in them becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk soe is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

during the year ended december 31 2014 northern trust did not exceed its soe limits 

  

sensitivity of economic value of equity seve 

economic value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100 or 200 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions 

       

  

  the following table shows the estimated impact on economic value of equity of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current interest rates given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero the simulation of the economic value of equity for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results 

  

table 38 interest rate risk simulation of economic value of equity as of december 31 2014 

  

   

stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that results in them becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk 

the simulations of economic value of equity do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk seve is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided 

during the year ended december 31 2014 northern trust did not exceed its seve limits 

  

interest rate risk monitoring 

northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk as measured by the soe and seve simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of riskreturn tradeoffs a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including 

        

northern trust strives to use the most effective instruments for implementing its interest rate risk management strategies considering the costs liquidity collateral and capital requirements of the various alternatives and the riskreturn tradeoffs 

  

foreign currency risk overview 

northern trust is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust’s currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense 

in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust’s growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods 

  

  foreign currency risk measurement 

northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio 

var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions directly from northern trust’s trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies corporate market risk monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness 

  

foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis 

northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of alternative risk metrics  offering corroborating measures and useful perspectives on northern trust’s market risks 

automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the corporate market risk unit also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with an historical perspective on risk 

the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the quarters indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a one day horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents 

  

table 39 foreign currency valueatrisk 

  

   

during 2014 and 2013 northern trust did not incur an actual trading loss in excess of the daily value at risk estimate 

  

other nonmaterial trading activities 

market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible northern trust’s brokerdealer northern trust securities inc maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged 54 million for the year ended december 31 2014 

northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps floors and swaptions an option to enter into an interest rate swap all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities

strategic risk 

strategic risk is the longterm risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions improper implementation of business decisions unexpected external events or damage to northern trust’s reputation from negative public opinion strategic risk includes the following three subcategories 

  

business risk the risk arising from the general economic conditions and external factors in which northern trust operates that could adversely affect its revenues profits and or capital 

strategy risk the longterm risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions improper implementation of business decisions and unexpected external events and 

reputation risk the risk arising from negative perception on the part of clients counterparties stockholders investors debt holders market analysts regulators staff or other relevant parties that adversely affects northern trust’s ability to conduct its business or to access sources of funding 

  

the gerc and the business strategy committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk

government monetary and fiscal policies 

the earnings of northern trust are affected by numerous external influences chief among these are general economic conditions both domestic and international and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies these general conditions affect all of northern trust’s businesses as well as the quality value and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios 

the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board is an important regulator of us economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the united states the federal reserve board accomplishes this objective by its open market operations in united states government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds 

regulation and supervision 

the laws and regulations that govern our activities are complex legislators and regulators frequently revise existing laws and regulations and adopt new ones it is likely that the regulatory and supervisory requirements governing our banking activities will change during the course of the year the following describes some of the principal laws and regulations that currently apply to the corporation the bank and our other affiliates 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company each of the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition as a result of the doddfrank act’s as defined and discussed 

 

further below amendment of the bhca the corporation must also be and remain “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies as an illinois banking corporation the bank is also subject to illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area 

the bank also is provisionally registered with the us commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange act and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the cftc applicable to swap dealers certain of our other affiliates are registered with the cftc as a commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the cftc 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve board its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder other subsidiaries are regulated by state banking departments in various states the bank and other subsidiaries of the corporation act as investment advisers to several mutual funds and other asset managers which are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the bank’s branches and subsidiaries outside the united states are subject to regulation by a number of nonus regulatory agencies for example branches and subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pra and fca exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees 

on june 8 2011 the european parliament and the council of the european union approved the alternative investment fund managers directive aifmd on july 22 2013 the aifmd entered into force via implementing legislation in eu member states the aifmd and its implementing legislation impose new regulatory requirements on covered alternative investment fund managers that are located or market fund interests in the eu including regulations regarding risk management and valuation functions leverage limits custodial requirements and investor disclosures the eu is also in the process of implementing several other new regulations that may affect our operations such as the european market infrastructure regulation emir emir came into effect on august 16 2012 and regulates overthecounter derivatives markets in the eu emir imposes several new regulations relating to common rules for central counterparties reporting and clearing obligations of parties to the overthecounter market and counterparty credit risk the bank is working diligently to comply with the aifmd emir and other eu rules and regulations given the continuing implementation process of these regulations the bank cannot determine the impact of such new regulations on the bank’s operations at this time 

 

our nonus branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally the bank’s and the corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2013 each of our nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements 

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds 

another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and cftc oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities including swap dealing activities as a result of the doddfrank act as defined and discussed further below the bank has provisionally registered with the cftc as a swap dealer and therefore may engage in swap dealing activity above a de minimis notional threshold established for swap dealing with us counterparties 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry and imposes significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the financial stability oversight council fsoc the federal reserve board the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the fdic 

the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that are most relevant to the corporation and its banking subsidiaries including the bank 

heightened prudential requirements  the doddfrank act imposes heightened prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation the heightened prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board also has the discretion to require these large us bank holding companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures the federal reserve board has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act but these proposed rules have not yet been finalized the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing heightened prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements under the final rules us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation must implement heightened prudential standards more specifically the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board be subject to supervisorconducted periodic stress tests to evaluate 

 

capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions conduct capital stress tests implement enhanced risk management procedures comply with a liquidity risk management framework conduct liquidity stress tests and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event 

resolution planning  as required by the doddfrank act the federal reserve board and fdic have jointly issued a final rule that requires certain organizations including each bhc with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition the fdic has issued a final rule that requires insured depository institutions with 50 billion or more in total assets such as the bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure the rule requires these insured institutions to submit a resolution plan that will enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the bank in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the netpresentvalue return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors the final rule also sets specific standards for the resolution plans including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components a description of the strategies for achieving the least costly resolution and analyses of the financial company’s organization material entities interconnections and interdependencies and management information systems among other elements the corporation’s resolution plan must among other things ensure that our depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from our other subsidiaries the corporation and the bank submitted a single resolution plan that complies with these rules in december 2013 

mortgage loan origination and risk retention  the doddfrank act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders including banks and thrifts most significantly the new standards prohibit the corporation’s subsidiaries from making a residential mortgage loan without verifying a borrower’s ability to repay limit the total points and fees that the corporation’s subsidiaries andor a mortgage broker may charge on certain mortgage loans to 3 of the total loan amount and prohibit certain prepayment penalty practices also the doddfrank act in conjunction with the federal reserve board’s final rule on loan originator compensation prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and steering consumers to loans not in their interest because it will result in greater compensation for a loan originator these standards will result in a myriad of new system pricing and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses 

proprietary trading and certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds  the doddfrank act adopts the socalled “volcker rule” which subject to a twoyear transition period and certain exceptions became effective on july 21 2012 and prohibits a banking entity from engaging in “proprietary trading” which is defined as engaging as principal for the “trading account” of the banking entity in securities or other instruments as determined by federal regulators certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as “permitted activities” and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading such as “marketmakingrelated activities” “riskmitigating hedging activities” and trading in us government or agency obligations certain other us state or municipal obligations and the obligations of fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae additionally subject to a transition period and certain exceptions the rule restricts a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in certain private funds while a banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds if certain conditions are met it may not acquire or retain an equity partnership or other ownership interest in such private funds except for certain limited investments a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the fund or permitting the fund to use the name of the bank 

in october 2011 the occ federal reserve board the fdic and the sec in consultation with the commodity futures trading commission cftc jointly released a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the volcker rule limitations of the doddfrank act after extensive comment from the banking industry consumer groups and others on december 10 2013 the occ federal reserve board the fdic the sec and the cftc issued the final volcker rule that same day the regulatory agencies extended the conformance period for compliance with the final rule until july 21 2015 

 

the final rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for market making hedging certain trading activities in us and foreign sovereign debt certain trading activities of nonus banking entities trading outside the united states and trading activities related to liquidity management the final rule also maintains the ban on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds” such as hedge funds or private equity funds the final rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule in light of the complexity of the final regulation the uncertain implementation of the final rule and the possible regulatory and legislative changes to the final rule the corporation cannot fully assess the impact of the volcker rule on its business at this time 

swaps and other derivatives  title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be “pushed out” of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” a “swap dealer” a “majorsecuritybased swap participant” or a “securitybased swap dealer” the cftc and sec have finalized joint rules further defining these entities and the cftc sec and other us regulators are in the process of adopting regulations to implement title vii the cftc has also finalized many rules applicable to swap dealers and other swap market participants including business conduct standards for swap dealers reporting and recordkeeping mandatory central clearing for certain swaps exchangetrading rules applicable to swaps and regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities it is anticipated that the cftc’s ongoing rulemaking process will further clarify other subjects under title vii including margin and capital requirements it is also anticipated that the sec will continue with its rulemaking process which will further clarify among other things reporting and recordkeeping obligations the scope of registration requirements central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps rules have also been issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities the cftc and sec have yet to complete the implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop 

consumer financial protection  the doddfrank act established a new independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the cfpb has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing financial products and services offered to consumers for banking organizations with assets of 10 billion or more including the bank the cfpb has exclusive rule making and examination and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the cfpb this new federal and state regulatory framework may result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the corporation and its bank subsidiaries in respect of consumer financial products and services with potentially significant increases in compliance costs 

incentive compensation arrangements  the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions on april 14 2011 federal regulators including the fdic the federal reserve board and the sec issued a proposed rule which among other things would require certain executive officers of covered financial institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation to defer at least 50 of their annual incentivebased compensation for a minimum of three years no final rule has been issued to date 

the requirements of the doddfrank act will continue to be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporation’s operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporation’s business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage 

 

requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporation’s business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements 

holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that control the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the sourceofstrength requirements the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress to date no final regulations have been adopted 

this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly without federal reserve board approval a bank holding company cannot pay cash dividends that exceed its net income and cash dividends cannot be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

additionally federal reserve board regulations require every bank holding company domiciled in the us that has 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis the federal reserve evaluates an institution’s plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock as part of the capital plan reviews in some cases such as when an institution’s capital plan has been rejected by the federal reserve the institution is required to receive approval from the federal reserve before making capital distributions the corporation submitted its capital plan as a part of the federal reserve’s 2013 capital plan review cappr and the federal reserve did not object to the corporation’s plan the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve in january 2014 as part of the federal reserve’s 2014 comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar 

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation as of december 31 2013 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005 additionally on july 2 2013 the federal bank regulatory agencies introduced new capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules designed to implement the revised standards of the basel committee published in december 2010 and revised in june 2011 basel iii these basel iii rules will come into effect between january 1 2014 and january 1 2019 

under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least four percent unless the institution is ranked a composite 1 under the camels rating system of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets 

 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the bank’s riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2013 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 as mentioned above we are also subject to the basel ii framework for riskbased capital adequacy the us bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and must satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run in april 2010 the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements 

on september 12 2010 the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee announced agreement on the calibration and phasein arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements known as basel iii on july 2 2013 the federal reserve board issued final rules implementing basel iii in the united states under these rules when fully phasedin banking organizations will be required to satisfy four riskbased capital ratios 

 

  

  

  

 under the federal reserve board’s implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act we are subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach we will therefore be required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and will be subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy under the prompt corrective action framework

on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and publicly disclose their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014 current results from the parallel run of the riskbased capital framework have demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches methodologies inclusive of commitments we provided to the federal reserve regarding our approach to the calculation of riskweighted assets has not resulted in common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as “wellcapitalized” these results show that as of december 31 2013 the corporation’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been 116 on a fully phasedin basis while the corporation’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been 111 on a fully phasedin basis 

basel iii also introduces a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount greater than 25 of its total riskweighted assets the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of 

 

economic stress banking organizations with a tier 1 common equity ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduces a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of a banking organization’s total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures 

the us’s implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital in october 2013 the us banking agencies proposed a rule that would introduce quantitative liquidity requirements in the us for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank the ultimate impact of the us implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and its bank subsidiaries is currently being reviewed at this point we cannot determine the ultimate effect these final and proposed regulations would have upon our earnings or financial position however we believe our capital strength balance sheet and business model leave us well positioned for the us implementation of basel iii 

prompt corrective action 

under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take “prompt corrective action” against undercapitalized us banking institutions us banking institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to different regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls a banking institution is deemed to be “wellcapitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure under certain circumstances a wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2013 the corporation and the bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “wellcapitalized” 

as noted above on december 20 2011 the federal reserve board requested comment on a proposed rule to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 “early remediation requirements” similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm’s financial condition deteriorates triggers for remediation include capital levels stress test results and risk management weaknesses no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to date 

examination and enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of unsafe or unsound circumstances exist 

 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

fdicinsured banks including the corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and client identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus clients financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 

 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 

many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic the doddfrank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits 

fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institution’s risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators the institution’s capital levels and other risk measures 

the doddfrank act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits effective september 30 2020 eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif to 2 where it remains today the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act 

the fdic has implemented a revised rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing the final rule mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the prior assessment base the rule’s assessment rates are lower than the previous rates which achieves the fdic’s goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the rule adopts a “scorecard” assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year under the rule the bank will pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the previous system 

continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the doddfrank act may result in higher assessment rates which could reduce the profitability of or otherwise negatively impact the bank 

 

interstate banking and branching 

the doddfrank act amends the bhca to require a bank holding company seeking approval to acquire shares of a bank located outside of the bank holding company’s home state to be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged similarly the doddfrank act amends the bank merger act to require that the surviving bank in an interstate merger transaction be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged 

in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the doddfrank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state 

community reinvestment act 

the bank is subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction the bank received an “outstanding” cra rating from its regulator in its most recent cra examination 

in october 2012 the federal reserve board the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the bank’s cra compliance approved the designation of the bank as a “wholesale bank” as a result of this redesignation the bank now fulfills its cra obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development rather than retail cra loans 

in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry as of december 31 2013 the bank is not a party to any such agreements 

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches 

consumer laws and regulations 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to 

 

substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws 

many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above 

money market mutual funds 

on june 5 2013 the sec proposed a rule regarding money market mutual funds mmmf reform the sec proposal set forth two alternative methods of reform either requiring mmmfs to transact at a “floating” net asset value per share or imposing a liquidity fee if a mmmf’s liquidity level fell below a specified threshold and permitting a fund to temporarily suspend redemptions the comment period for these alternative proposals closed on september 17 2013 no final rule has been issued to date because of the uncertainty as to whether the sec will issue final rules and what the final rules will require the corporation and the bank cannot fully evaluate such reforms’ impact to their business at this time 

future legislation 

federal state local and nonus legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks their holding companies and their affiliates such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways northern trust cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations might have upon its financial condition or results of operations 

staff 

northern trust employed approximately 14800 fulltime equivalent officers and staff members as of december 31 2013

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business 

 

we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so 

we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive 

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect northern trust’s businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 operational risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “market risk management—operational risk management” in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 5051 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings 

 

  

  

  

credit risks 

a number of northern trust’s product offerings involve credit risk which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us these product offerings include loans leases derivatives foreign exchange and other credit commitments 

 

  

  

  

liquidity risks

regulation risks 

virtually every aspect of northern trust’s business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank securities and other regulators globally 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices impose upon us more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition for a more detailed description of the doddfrank act see “business—regulation and supervision—the doddfrank act” 

 

  

  

  

  

 see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions increases this risk

the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board is an important regulator of us economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this objective is accomplished by the federal reserve board’s open market operations in united states government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the composition and use of northern trust’s resources

regulation and supervision 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiary the bank must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition the corporation must also be and remain “wellcapitalized” and “well managed” in order to retain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies the bank as an illinois banking corporation is also subject to illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve board its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder other subsidiaries are regulated by state banking departments in various states the bank and other subsidiaries of the corporation act as investment advisers to several mutual funds and other asset managers which are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 

  

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of federal law 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the us are subject to regulation and supervision by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are subject to regulation by and supervision of the financial services authority fsa and are authorized to conduct such activities pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their registered employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the us are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally the corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2012 each of the corporation’s nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements as is the case in the us european regulatory authorities are introducing regulatory change in a wide variety of areas for example new regulations issued by european regulators through the undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ucits iv directive directly and indirectly affect depositary fund management and fund administration businesses european authorities are in the process of implementing the alternative investment fund managers directive which will affect the duties of depositaries european union eu and noneu fund managers and nonucits funds european regulatory authorities are also putting forward proposals through the markets in financial instruments directive 2 european market infrastructure regulation and market abuse regulation proposals which deal with derivatives trading and clearing pre and post trade transparency investor protection issues and overall market orderliness these actual and proposed regulatory changes have impacted and will impact the business that the bank and its nonus subsidiaries conduct in the european union 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry and imposes significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the designation of certain financial companies as “systemically important financial institutions” sifis the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the financial stability oversight council fsoc the federal reserve board the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the fdic 

the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that are most relevant to the corporation and its banking subsidiaries 

  

heightened prudential requirements  the doddfrank act imposes heightened prudential requirements on us bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets including the corporation and on large financial companies and nonbank financial companies that the fsoc determines should be subject to federal reserve board supervision these companies are referred to as systemically important financial institutions or sifis the heightened prudential standards include more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity and riskmanagement requirements than those applied to other bank holding companies or other financial companies the federal reserve board and the fsoc will also have the discretion to require these companies to limit their shortterm debt to issue contingent capital instruments and to provide enhanced public disclosures sifis will also be subject to periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy and liquidity in adverse economic conditions heightened prudential standards may be applied on a graduated basis using the factors included in the fsoc systemic determination standards on december 20 2011 the federal reserve board requested public comments on proposed rules that would implement the enhanced prudential standards required to be established under section 165 of the doddfrank act and the early remediation requirements established under section 166 of the doddfrank act in addition covered companies including the corporation must prepare and file credit exposure reports and limit their aggregate credit exposures broadly defined to any unaffiliated company to 25 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the covered company 

resolution planning  as required by the doddfrank act the federal reserve and fdic have jointly issued a final rule that requires certain organizations including each bhc with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure the corporation’s resolution plan must among other things ensure that our depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from our other subsidiaries the final rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution and a description of the company’s organizational structure material entities interconnections and interdependencies and management information systems among other elements in addition the fdic has issued a final rule that requires insured depository institutions with 50 billion or more in total assets such as the bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure the rule requires these insured institutions to submit a resolution plan that will enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the bank in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the netpresentvalue return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors the final rule also sets specific standards for the resolution plans including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components a description of the strategies for achieving the least costly resolution and analyses of the financial company’s organization material entities interconnections and interdependencies and management information systems among other elements our initial plans are required to be submitted to the regulators by december 31 2013 

mortgage loan origination and risk retention  the doddfrank act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders including banks and thrifts most significantly the new standards prohibit the corporation’s subsidiaries from making a residential mortgage loan without verifying a borrower’s ability to repay limit the total points and fees that the corporation’s subsidiaries andor a mortgage broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3 of the total loan amount and prohibit certain prepayment penalty practices also the doddfrank act in conjunction with the federal reserve board’s final rule on loan originator compensation prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and steering consumers to loans not in their interest because it will result in greater compensation for a loan originator these standards will result in a myriad of new system pricing and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses 

proprietary trading and certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds  the doddfrank act adopts the socalled “volcker rule” which subject to a twoyear transition period and certain exceptions became effective on july 21 2012 and prohibits a banking entity from engaging in “proprietary trading” which is defined as engaging as principal for the “trading account” of the banking entity in securities or other instruments as determined by federal regulators certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as “permitted activities” and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading such as “marketmakingrelated activities” “riskmitigating hedging activities” and trading in us government or agency obligations certain other us state or municipal obligations and the obligations of fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae additionally subject to a transition period and certain exceptions the rule restricts a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in certain private funds while a banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds if certain conditions are met it may not acquire or retain an equity partnership or other ownership interest in such private funds except for certain limited investments 

  

a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the fund or permitting the fund to use the name of the bank after the conformance period commencing july 21 2012 the volcker rule prohibitions and restrictions will apply to banking entities including the corporation the bank and their affiliates unless an exception applies in october 2011 the occ federal reserve board the fdic and the sec in consultation with the commodity futures trading commission cftc jointly released a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the volcker rule limitations of the doddfrank act to date no final rule has been issued in light of the complexity of the proposed regulation and the substantial number of comments submitted the corporation cannot fully assess the impact of the volcker rule on its business until final rules are adopted 

swaps and other derivatives  title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be “pushed out” of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” or a “swap dealer” the cftc sec and other us regulators have adopted and are still in the process of adopting regulations to implement title vii it is anticipated that this rulemaking process will further clarify among other things reporting and recordkeeping obligations margin and capital requirements the scope of registration requirements and what swaps are required to be centrally cleared and exchangetraded rules will also be issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities 

consumer financial protection  the doddfrank act establishes a new independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the cfpb has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing financial products and services offered to consumers for banking organizations with assets of 10 billion or more including the bank the cfpb has exclusive rule making and examination and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the cfpb this new federal and state regulatory framework may result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the corporation and its bank subsidiaries in respect of consumer financial products and services with potentially significant increases in compliance costs 

incentive compensation arrangements  the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions on april 14 2011 federal regulators including the fdic the federal reserve board and the sec issued a proposed rule which among other things would require certain executive officers of covered financial institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation to defer at least 50 of their annual incentivebased compensation for a minimum of three years no final rule has been issued to date 

the requirements of the doddfrank act will be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several months or years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporation’s operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporation’s business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporation’s business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements 

holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia 

under the fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that own the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with 

  

the sourceofstrength requirements the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress the doddfrank act statutory requirements became effective on july 21 2011 although the appropriate federal banking agencies were required by the doddfrank act to jointly adopt implementing regulations by july 21 2011 to date no final regulations have been adopted 

this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly without federal reserve board approval a bank holding company cannot pay cash dividends that exceed its net income and cash dividends cannot be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as described below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

bank holding companies domiciled in the us with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review under the final rule the federal reserve board annually evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases the federal reserve board will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions only for companies whose capital plans receive a nonobjection by supervisors and are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to operate as successful financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios after making the desired capital distributions the federal reserve board annually issues instructions outlining the information it is seeking from the covered firms including the corporation and the evaluation the federal reserve board will do of the capital plans the level of detail and analysis expected in each institution’s capital plan varies based on the company’s size complexity risk profile and scope of operations in january 2012 the corporation submitted its first capital plan to the federal reserve board and its second capital plan was submitted on january 7 2013 

  

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation the current riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005 

basel i 

under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdic insured depository institutions are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 basel ii 

as mentioned above the corporation also is subject to the basel ii framework for riskbased capital adequacy the us bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations as a result the corporation and the bank will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii the rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

  

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation was required to adopt and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculated capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run in april 2010 

the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and its depository institution subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements 

basel iii 

on december 16 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation known as basel iii the basel iii calibration and phasein arrangements were previously endorsed by the seoul g20 leaders summit in november 2010 and will be subject to individual adoption by member nations including the us under these standards when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 banking institutions will be required to satisfy three riskbased capital ratios 

a common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 70 inclusive of 45 minimum common equity tier 1 ratio net of regulatory deductions and the new 25 “capital conservation buffer” of common equity to riskweighted assets 

a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 85 inclusive of the 25 capital conservation buffer and 

a total capital ratio of at least 105 inclusive of the 25 capital conservation buffer 

the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall the basel committee also announced that a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of common equity or other lossabsorbing capital “will be implemented according to national circumstances” as an “extension” of the conservation buffer during periods of excess credit growth 

basel i and basel ii do not include a leverage requirement as an international standard however basel iii introduces a nonrisk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3 based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards 

the basel committee had initially planned for member nations to begin implementing the basel iii requirements by january 1 2013 with full implementation by january 1 2019 on november 9 2012 us regulators announced that implementation of basel iii’s first requirements would be delayed until an undetermined future date the regulators made no indication that any other future regulatory phasein dates would be delayed 

on november 4 2011 the basel committee issued its final rule setting forth proposals to apply a new common equity tier 1 surcharge to certain designated global systemically important banks gsibs gsibs subject to the surcharge are identified by application of a quantitative “indicatorbased approach” for evaluating systemic risk that weights both categories and indicators of size substitutability interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity and complexity on november 1 2012 using the basel committee’s methodology the financial stability board fsb and the basel committee identified 28 financial institutions determined to be gsibs the group of gsibs is updated annually and published by the fsb each november at this time the corporation has not been designated as a gsib the gsibs equity surcharge provisions like the rest of basel iii are subject to interpretation and implementation by us regulatory authorities 

under the doddfrank act for sifis including the corporation the federal reserve board may increase the capital buffer the purpose of these new capital requirements is to ensure financial institutions are better capitalized to withstand periods of unfavorable financial and economic conditions the doddfrank act also requires the establishment of more stringent prudential standards by requiring the federal banking agencies to adopt capital and liquidity requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution pose to the institution and the public and private stakeholders including risks arising from certain enumerated activities in particular the doddfrank act excludes trust preferred securities issued on or after may 19 2010 from tier 1 capital for depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than 15 billion at december 31 2009 trust preferred securities issued before may 19 2010 will be phasedout of tier 1 capital over a threeyear period 

  

on june 7 2012 the board of governors of the federal reserve in conjunction with the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic published three notices of proposed rulemaking related to basel iii the proposed rules include two calculation methods a standardized approach applicable to all depository institutions bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 500 million or more and savings and loan holding companies and an advanced approach generally applicable only to the largest most internationally active banking organizations the corporation and bank will calculate their capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches under the proposed rules the corporation and the bank must maintain capital levels that exceed the adequately capitalized minimum ratios under the most constraining of the two approaches for advanced approaches institutions the proposed rules state that for the capital conservation buffer any countercyclical capital buffer applied and any other capital surcharges that are applied a depository institution’s or bank holding company’s capital adequacy will be assessed using the advanced approaches 

the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and the bank is currently being reviewed and will depend on a number of factors including the rulemaking and implementation by the us banking regulators the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation or subsequent regulations if enacted would have upon the corporation’s earnings or financial position in addition significant questions remain as to how the capital and liquidity mandates of the doddfrank act will be integrated with the requirements of basel iii however as the corporation currently understands basel iii it believes its capital strength balance sheet and business model leave it well positioned for basel iii 

prompt corrective action 

under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take “prompt corrective action” against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2012 the corporation and the bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

examination and enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

fdicinsured banks including the corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions other than the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that permits a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and client identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus clients financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 

  

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 

many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions additionally neither the company nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries have engaged in activities which are sanctionable under the iran sanctions act or the comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act cisada engaged in transactions with the government iran or persons whose assets are frozen pursuant to executive orders dealing with terrorism or weapons of mass destruction proliferation or engaged in the transfer of goods technology or services to iran that are likely to be used for human rights abuses against the iranian people 

deposit insurance and assessments 

fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institution’s risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators the institution’s capital levels and other risk measures 

the doddfrank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits federal deposit insurance for the full net amount of deposits in noninterest bearing transaction accounts expired on december 31 2012 for all insured banks 

the doddfrank act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits effective september 30 2020 eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif to 2 where it remains today the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act 

the fdic’s rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the old assessment base the final rule’s assessment rates are lower than the older rates which achieves the fdic’s goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the rule adopts a “scorecard” assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year under the final rule the bank will pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the old system 

continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the doddfrank act may result in higher assessment rates which could reduce the profitability of or otherwise negatively impact the bank 

interstate banking and branching 

the doddfrank act amends the bhca to require a bank holding company seeking approval to acquire shares of a bank located outside of the bank holding company’s home state to be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged similarly the doddfrank act amends the bank merger act to require that the surviving bank in an interstate merger transaction be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged 

  

in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the doddfrank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state 

community reinvestment act 

the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction the bank in its most recent cra examination received an outstanding cra rating from its regulator 

in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry as of december 31 2012 the bank is not a party to any such agreements 

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and requiring notification of security breaches 

consumer laws and regulations 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 

many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws 

money market mutual fund regulation 

after the sec announced on august 28 2012 that it would not solicit public comment on potential money market mutual funds mmmf structural reforms on november 3 2012 the fsoc published for public comment three approaches to mmmf reform the fsoc noted that the three approaches to mmmf reform were not necessarily exclusive and could be implemented in some combination because of the uncertainty as to whether fsoc will issue final rules whether the sec will issue a proposed rule and which or in what combination the three approaches or others might be adopted the corporation cannot fully evaluate such reforms’ impact to the corporation’s business at this time 

future legislation 

federal state local and nonus legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks thrifts their holding companies and their affiliates such 

  

legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations might have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation or its subsidiaries

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business 

we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so 

this list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive 

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect northern trust’s businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 operational risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks

 liquidity risks 

northern trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients 

 

  

  

  

   

see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “liquidity and capital resources” in the 2012 annual report to stockholders pages 42 through 46 including the discussion of the possible negative effects of a significant downgrade of any of the corporation’s debt ratings page 43 

 

  

 regulation risks

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions increases this risk 

as more fully described in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in the 2012 annual report to stockholders captioned “note 24 – contingent liabilities” pages 108 through 110 certain putative class actions and a shareholder derivative action were filed against us andor certain of our current or former officers and directors these cases allege either breach of fiduciary duty under common law or under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” related to our securities lending program or the violation of securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duty for allegedly taking insufficient provisions for credit losses with respect to our real estate loan portfolio and allegedly failing to make sufficient disclosures regarding our securities lending business 

 

  

 tax risks

strategic and competitive risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so a variety of risks could interfere with these plans 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance

regulation and supervision 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors 

  

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiary the bank must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra in addition the corporation must also be and remain “wellcapitalized” and “well managed” in order to retain its status as a financial holding company failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies the bank as an illinois banking corporation is also subject to illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area in addition the corporation the bank and the corporation’s new york trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the banking department of the state of new york 

on october 1 2011 the corporation merged its national bank subsidiary northern trust na and federal savings bank northern trust bank fsb with and into the bank in order to simplify the corporation’s organization reduce costs consolidate capital and enhance client experience 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve board its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder other subsidiaries are regulated by state banking departments in connecticut delaware and california two families of mutual funds for which the bank acts as investment adviser and one registered closedend hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer 

  

registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of federal law 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the us are subject to regulation and supervision by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are subject to regulation by and supervision of the financial services authority fsa and are authorized to conduct such activities pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their registered employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the us are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally the corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2011 each of the corporation’s nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements as is the case in the us european regulatory authorities are introducing regulatory change in a wide variety of areas for example european regulators have introduced through the undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” iv directive new requirements that directly and indirectly affect depositary fund management and fund administration businesses european authorities have begun the process of implementing the alternative investment fund managers directive which will affect the duties of depositaries european union “eu” and noneu fund managers and nonucits funds european regulatory authorities are also putting forward proposals through the markets in financial instruments directive 2 european market infrastructure regulation and market abuse regulation proposals which deal with derivatives trading and clearing pre and post trade transparency investor protection issues and overall market orderliness these actual and proposed regulatory changes have impacted and will impact the business that the bank’s and its nonus subsidiaries’ conduct in the european union 

the doddfrank act 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was signed into law the doddfrank act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry and imposes significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the designation of certain financial companies as “systemically important financial institutions” sifis the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the financial stability oversight council fsoc the federal reserve board the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the fdic 

the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that are most relevant to the corporation and its banking subsidiaries 

 

   

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the requirements of the doddfrank act will be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several months or years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporation’s operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporation’s business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporation’s business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements 

holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia 

under the fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that own the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the sourceofstrength requirements the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress the doddfrank act statutory requirements became effective on july 21 2011 although the appropriate federal banking agencies were required by the doddfrank act to jointly adopt implementing regulations by july 21 2011 to date no final regulations have been adopted 

this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions 

  

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly without federal reserve board approval a bank holding company cannot pay cash dividends that exceed its net income and cash dividends cannot be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits” as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as described below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

on november 22 2011 the federal reserve board issued a final rule implementing the requirement of the doddfrank act that bank holding companies domiciled in the us with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review under the final rule the federal reserve board will annually evaluate institutions’ capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases the federal reserve board will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions only for companies whose capital plans are approved by supervisors and are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to operate as successful financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios after making the desired capital distributions in addition to issuing the final rule the federal reserve board launched the 2012 review by issuing instructions outlining the information the federal reserve board is seeking from the covered firms including the corporation and the analysis the federal reserve board will do on the capital plans the level of detail and analysis expected in each institution’s capital plan will vary based on the company’s size complexity risk profile and scope of operations in january 2012 the corporation submitted its first capital plan to the federal reserve board 

capital adequacy requirements 

the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation the current riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005 

  

basel i 

under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdic insured depository institutions are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 basel ii 

as mentioned above the corporation also is subject to the basel ii framework for riskbased capital adequacy the us bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations as a result the corporation and the bank will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii the rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation was required to adopt and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculated capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run in april 2010 the doddfrank act requires the us banking regulatory agencies to amend their capital rules to provide that minimum capital required under the basel ibased rules will act as a floor for minimum capital requirements calculated in accordance with the us basel ii rules accordingly the transition for “core” banks to calculations only under the basel iibased requirements is being eliminated 

the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and its depository institution subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements 

  

basel iii 

on december 16 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation known as basel iii the basel iii calibration and phasein arrangements were previously endorsed by the seoul g20 leaders summit in november 2010 and will be subject to individual adoption by member nations including the us under these standards when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 banking institutions will be required to satisfy three riskbased capital ratios 

 

  

  

 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a tier 1 common equity ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall the basel committee also announced that a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of common equity or other lossabsorbing capital “will be implemented according to national circumstances” as an “extension” of the conservation buffer during periods of excess credit growth 

basel i and basel ii do not include a leverage requirement as an international standard however basel iii introduces a nonrisk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3 based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards 

the increases to the minimum common equity and tier 1 capital ratios will be phasedin over two years beginning on january 1 2013 with the full increases taking effect on january 1 2015 this will be followed by a threeyear phasein beginning on january 1 2016 of the capital conservation buffer with the full 25 buffer requirement taking effect on january 1 2019 

basel iii also provides for the deduction of certain assets from capital deferred tax assets mortgage servicing rights investments in financial firms and pension assets among others within prescribed limitations the inclusion of other comprehensive income in capital and increased capital for counterparty credit risk the phasein period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent increments starting january 1 2014 with full implementation by january 1 2018 

on november 4 2011 the basel committee issued its final rule setting forth proposals to apply a new tier 1 common equity surcharge to certain designated global systemically important banks gsibs gsibs subject to the surcharge would be identified by application of a quantitative “indicatorbased approach” for evaluating systemic risk that weights both categories and indicators of size substitutability interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity and complexity also on november 4 2011 using the basel committee’s methodology the financial stability board fsb and the basel committee identified an initial group of 29 financial institutions determined to be gsibs although the corporation was not included on the list the group of gsibs will be updated annually and published by the fsb each november the gsibs equity surcharge provisions like the rest of basel iii are subject to interpretation and implementation by us regulatory authorities 

under the doddfrank act for sifis including the corporation the federal reserve board may increase the capital buffer the purpose of these new capital requirements is to ensure financial institutions are better capitalized to withstand periods of unfavorable financial and economic conditions the doddfrank act also requires the establishment of more stringent prudential standards by requiring the federal banking agencies to adopt capital and liquidity requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution pose to the institution and the public and private stakeholders including risks arising from certain enumerated activities in particular the doddfrank act excludes trust preferred securities issued on or after may 19 2010 from tier 1 capital for depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than 15 billion at december 31 2009 trust preferred securities issued before may 19 2010 will be phasedout of tier 1 capital over a threeyear period 

the federal banking agencies will likely implement changes to the current capital adequacy standards applicable to the corporation and the bank in light of basel iii if adopted by federal banking agencies basel iii could lead to significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and the bank is currently being reviewed and will depend on a number of 

  

factors including the rulemaking and implementation by the us banking regulators the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation or subsequent regulations if enacted would have upon the corporation’s earnings or financial position in addition significant questions remain as to how the capital and liquidity mandates of the doddfrank act will be integrated with the requirements of basel iii however as the corporation currently understands basel iii it believes its capital strength balance sheet and business model leave it well positioned for basel iii 

prompt corrective action 

under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take “prompt corrective action” against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2011 the corporation and the bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

examination and enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution 

 

  

  

  

  

 the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

fdicinsured banks including the corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the bank’s parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions” including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in 

  

the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions other than the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that permits a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus customers financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 

many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions 

deposit insurance and assessments 

fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institution’s risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators and the institution’s capital levels and other risk measures the fdic recently raised assessment rates to increase funding for the dif which is currently underfunded 

  

the doddfrank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits in addition federal deposit insurance for the full net amount of deposits in noninterest bearing transaction accounts was extended to january 1 2013 for all insured banks 

the doddfrank act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits effective september 30 2020 eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif to 2 the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act 

effective april 1 2011 the fdic implemented a rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing the final rule mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the current assessment base the final rule’s assessment rates are lower than the current rates which achieves the fdic’s goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the final rule adopts a “scorecard” assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the final rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the final rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year under the final rule the bank will pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the old system 

continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the doddfrank act may result in higher assessment rates which could reduce the profitability of or otherwise negatively impact the bank 

interstate banking and branching 

the doddfrank act amends the bhca to require a bank holding company seeking approval to acquire shares of a bank located outside of the bank holding company’s home state to be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged similarly the doddfrank act amends the bank merger act to require that the surviving bank in an interstate merger transaction be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged these requirements became effective on july 21 2011 

in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the doddfrank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state on october 1 2011 the corporation merged its national bank subsidiary northern trust na and federal savings bank northern trust bank fsb with and into the bank 

community reinvestment act 

the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction the bank in its most recent cra examination received an outstanding cra rating from its regulator 

  

in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry 

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of customer information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to customers in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and requiring notification of security breaches 

consumer laws and regulations 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 

many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws 

future legislation 

federal state local and nonus legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks thrifts their holding companies and their affiliates such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations might have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation or its subsidiaries

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business 

we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so 

this list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive 

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect northern trust’s businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 operational risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings 

 

  

  

 credit risks

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions increases this risk 

 

   

 tax risks 

in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 

 

  

 strategic and competitive risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so a variety of risks could interfere with these plans 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance

regulation and supervision 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 bhca as amended consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company each of the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act cra failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies or continue certain activities 

  

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum authorized limit and it is subject to regulation by both these entities as well as by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve board in this area in addition the corporation the bank and the corporation’s new york trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the banking department of the state of new york 

the corporation’s national bank subsidiary is a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ with deposits insured by the fdic to the extent provided by the federal deposit insurance act and fdic regulations northern trust bank fsb a subsidiary of the corporation is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision otc and the fdic with its deposits insured by the fdic recent changes in the law will in the future shift principal regulatory jurisdiction over northern trust bank fsb from the otc to the occ 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve board its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder other subsidiaries are regulated by the connecticut department of banking and the office of the state bank commissioner in delaware two families of mutual funds for which the bank acts as investment adviser and one registered closedend hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 

functional regulation 

federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of federal law 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the united states are subject to regulation by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation by the financial services authority fsa the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the united states are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally the corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2010 each of the corporation’s nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements 

  

the doddfrank act 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was signed into law the doddfrank act will have a broad impact on the financial services industry and will impose significant new regulatory and compliance requirements including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically significant the imposition of increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness within the financial services sector additionally the doddfrank act establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies including the financial stability oversight council council the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic 

the following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the doddfrank act that are most relevant to the corporation and its banking subsidiaries 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 many of the requirements of the doddfrank act will be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several months or years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporation’s operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporation’s business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporation’s business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements 

holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia 

the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that own the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the sourceofstrength requirements the term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries by july 21 2011 the appropriate federal banking agencies must jointly adopt implementing regulations under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the corporation’s subsidiary depository institutions should any of them experience financial distress 

under the fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries 

  

this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as described below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends 

capital adequacy requirements 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation the current riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and its us subsidiary banks commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005 

under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of the loan loss reserve goodwill and certain other intangible assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its us banking subsidiaries 

  

together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 as mentioned above the corporation also is subject to the basel ii framework for riskbased capital adequacy the us bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations as a result the corporation and its us depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii the rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and must satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run of calculations under both the old and new guidelines in april 2010 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and the bank subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements 

current results from the parallel run of the basel ii riskbased capital framework have demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework have not resulted in the corporation’s or the bank’s tier 1 capital or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as “well capitalized” 

on september 12 2010 the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee announced agreement on the calibration and phasein arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements known as basel iii under these standards when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 banking institutions will be required to satisfy three riskbased capital ratios 

 

  

  

 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a tier 1 common equity ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall the basel committee also announced that a “countercyclical buffer” of 0 to 25 of common equity or other lossabsorbing capital “will be implemented according to national circumstances” as an “extension” of the conservation buffer during periods of excess credit growth 

  

basel iii also introduces a nonrisk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3 based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards the phasein of the new rules is to commence on january 1 2013 with the phasein of the capital conservation buffer commencing january 1 2015 and the rules to be fully phasedin by january 1 2019 

in november 2010 basel iii was endorsed by the seoul g20 leaders summit and will be subject to individual adoption by member nations including the united states on december 16 2010 the basel committee issued the text of the basel iii rules which presents the details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed by the basel committee and endorsed by the seoul g20 leaders summit the federal banking agencies will likely implement changes to the current capital adequacy standards applicable to the corporation and its bank subsidiaries in light of basel iii if adopted by federal banking agencies basel iii could lead to significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and its bank subsidiaries is currently being reviewed and will depend on a number of factors including the rulemaking and implementation by the us banking regulators the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation or subsequent regulations if enacted would have upon the corporation’s earnings or financial position in addition significant questions remain as to how the capital and liquidity mandates of the doddfrank act will be integrated with the requirements of basel iii however as the corporation currently understands basel iii it believes its capital strength balance sheet and business model leave it well positioned for basel iii 

note that the doddfrank act also requires the establishment of more stringent prudential standards by requiring the federal banking agencies to adopt capital and liquidity requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution pose to the institution and the public and private stakeholders including risks arising from certain enumerated activities in particular the doddfrank act excludes trust preferred securities issued on or after may 19 2010 from tier 1 capital for depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than 15 billion at december 31 2009 trust preferred securities issued before may 19 2010 will be phasedout of tier 1 capital over a threeyear period 

prompt corrective action 

under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take “prompt corrective action” against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2010 the corporation and all of its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution 

 

  

  

  

  

 the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any 

  

applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 

the corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under federal law including regulation w of the federal reserve board ie section 23a and b of the federal reserve act which limit certain transactions with the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries including loans other extensions of credit investments or asset purchases such transactions by a banking subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in amount to 10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus and with all affiliates together to an aggregate of 20 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus furthermore such loans and extensions of credit as well as certain other transactions are required to be secured in specified amounts these and certain other transactions with the corporation or any of its subsidiaries including any payment of money by a banking subsidiary must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies 

the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under section 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators 

the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as “insiders” contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the dodd frank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control 

under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus customers financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 

the office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 

many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporation’s nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions 

  

deposit insurance and assessments 

fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institution’s risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators and the institution’s capital levels and other risk measures the fdic recently raised assessment rates to increase funding for the deposit insurance fund dif which is currently underfunded 

the dodd frank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits in addition federal deposit insurance for the full net amount of deposits in noninterest bearing transaction accounts was extended to january 1 2013 for all insured banks 

the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment framework primarily by basing assessments on an institution’s total assets less tangible equity subject to riskbased adjustments that would further reduce the assessment base for custodial banks rather than domestic deposits which is expected to shift a greater portion of the aggregate assessments to large banks the doddfrank act also increases the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by september 30 2020 eliminates the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminates the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 

on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of dif to 2 the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act 

on february 7 2011 the fdic approved a final rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing the final rule mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the current assessment base the final rule’s assessment rates are lower than the current rates which achieves the fdic’s goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the final rule adopts a “scorecard” assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the final rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the final rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year based on current understanding of the final rule the corporation’s depository institution subsidiaries will likely pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the old system the final rule will take effect for the quarter beginning april 1 2011 and will be reflected in the invoices for assessments due september 30 2011 

continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the dodd frank act are likely to result in higher assessment rates which would reduce the profitability of the corporation’s depository institution subsidiaries 

in addition to its insurance assessment each insured bank is subject in 2011 to quarterly debt service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans bailout the first quarter 2011 debt service assessment is 0102

banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution among other things these laws require regulatory filings by a shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution the determination whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment as a general matter a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party owns or controls 25 or more of any class of its voting stock subject to rebuttal a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10 or more of any class of its voting stock ownership by affiliated parties or parties acting in concert is typically aggregated for these purposes if a party’s ownership of the corporation were to exceed certain thresholds the investor could be deemed to “control” the corporation for regulatory purposes this could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences 

  

interstate banking and branching 

federal law permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company with federal reserve board approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the dodd frank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state thrift institutions like northern trust bank fsb may freely engage in de novo branching on an interstate basis national banks such as northern trust na may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state 

community reinvestment act 

the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank the federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction each of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries including the bank received at least a satisfactory cra rating from its regulator in its most recent cra examination 

in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry 

privacy and security 

federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of customer information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to customers in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and requiring notification of security breaches 

consumer laws and regulations 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks while the following list is not exhaustive these laws and regulations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws 

future legislation 

federal state and local legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks thrifts their holding companies and their affiliates such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations might have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation or its subsidiaries the doddfrank act imposes substantial changes to the regulatory framework applicable to the corporation and its subsidiaries the majority of these changes will be implemented over time by various regulatory agencies the full effect that these changes will have on the corporation and its subsidiaries remains uncertain at this time and may have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation or its subsidiaries

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business 

we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our 

  

ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so 

this list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive 

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect northern trust’s businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

   

 operational risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings 

 

  

  

 credit risks 

a number of northern trust’s product offerings involve credit risk which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us these product offerings include loans leases derivatives foreign exchange and other credit commitments 

 

  

   

  

 liquidity risks

 see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “liquidity and capital resources” in the 2010 annual report to stockholders pages 4749 

 

  

   

 regulation risks

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions increases this risk 

 

  

   

 tax risks 

in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 

 

  

  

 strategic and competitive risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so a variety of risks could interfere with these plans 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance

functional regulation 

enacted in late 1999 the glba established a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks without this blanket exemption banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the sec and the federal reserve board in september 2007 adopted a regulation to implement the broker activities exemption of the glba that became effective for the bank beginning january 1 2009 the glba also amended the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of glba and the regulations adopted under them

emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 and other marketsupport measures 

in response to the global credit and liquidity crisis impacting financial institutions both domestically and internationally the united states government particularly the us department of the treasury us treasury the federal reserve board and the fdic have taken a number of extraordinary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions including capital injections guarantees of bank liabilities and the creation of special finance facilities on october 3 2008 the united states congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa under which the us treasury is granted broad authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 

the corporation’s participation in these various programs has been limited to the capital purchase program cpp under the troubled assets relief program tarp participation by certain of its subsidiary depository institutions in the fdic’s transaction account guarantee program and by certain funds advised by a subsidiary of the corporation in the temporary guaranty program for money market funds each of which is described below however the corporation continues to monitor each of the programs announced to date and the other legislative and regulatory developments that continue to emerge in reaction to the global financial crisis and evaluate the need for and the relative advantages and disadvantages to participation by the corporation in those various programs

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be required to make to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve board policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

  

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

capital adequacy requirements 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items tier 1 capital the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its us banking subsidiaries together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

   

the corporation also is subject to the framework for riskbased capital adequacy sometimes referred to as basel ii which was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision and has been endorsed by the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the g10 countries in december 2007 the us bank regulatory agencies published final rules effective april 1 2008 with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework the latest agreedversion of which was released by the basel committee in november 2005 

under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations as a result the corporation and its us depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii the new rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

in order to implement the new rules a core banking organization such as the corporation was required to and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan by october 1 2008 and must satisfactorily complete a fourquarter parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii the organization must then progress through three transitional periods of at least four quarters each commencing no later than april 1 2011 during these transitional periods the maximum cumulative reduction in capital requirements from those under the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii may not exceed 5 for the first period 10 for the second period and 15 for the third period supervisory approval is required to move through these transitional periods and out of the final transitional period the agencies also have said they will publish a study after the end of the second transitional year that will examine the new framework for any deficiencies 

noncore us banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under basel ii the agencies in july 2008 also published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would provide all noncore banking organizations with the option to adopt a standardized approach under basel ii which reflects a simpler methodology than the advanced approaches required of core banking organizations 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation has established a program management office to oversee the implementation of basel ii across the corporation and its bank subsidiaries the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and the bank subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted or plan to adopt the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements 

preliminary analysis of the basel ii riskbased capital framework suggests that the use of the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework will not result in the corporation’s or the bank’s tier 1 capital or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as “well capitalized” 

prompt corrective action 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

  

the federal banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2009 the corporation and all of its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

in the release adopting final basel ii rules the federal banking agencies said that these “prompt corrective action” rules will not be affected by the basel ii process and that core banking organizations will be required during the transitional period to use the lowest capital calculation in each category that results from the application of both the new and the old rules 

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

the federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties in addition to the grounds discussed under “prompt corrective action” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution

on february 27 2009 the fdic issued a final rule that revises the way the fdic calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of 2009 under the new rule the fdic first establishes an institution’s initial base assessment rate this initial base assessment rate will range depending on the risk category of the institution from 12 to 45 basis points the fdic will then adjust the initial base assessment higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate the adjustments to the initial base assessment rate will be based upon an institution’s levels of unsecured debt secured liabilities and brokered deposits the total base assessment rate will range from 7 to 775 basis points of the institution’s deposits 

on may 22 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution’s assets minus its tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 we recorded an expense of 202 million during the quarter ended june 30 2009 to reflect the special assessment 

on november 12 2009 the fdic issued a final rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions will be required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 on december 30 2009 under the rule the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010 will be based on each institution’s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of 2009 modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september 30 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter and the assessment rate for 2011 and 2012 will be equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional 3 basis points in addition each institution’s base assessment rate for each period will be calculated using its third quarter 2009 assessment base adjusted quarterly for an estimated 5 annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012 the amount of our prepayment on december 30 2009 was 1049 million this amount is amortized over the three year assessment period and will be adjusted for actual quarterly assessments for that period 

  

in addition to its insurance assessment each insured bank is subject in 2010 to quarterly debt service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans bailout the first quarter 2010 debt service assessment is 00106

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business 

  

we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so 

this list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive  

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions both in the us and internationally could adversely affect northern trust’s businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

   

 operational risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings 

 

  

  

 credit risks 

a number of northern trust’s product offerings involve credit risk which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us these product offerings include loans leases and other lending commitments 

 

   

  

 liquidity risks 

northern trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients 

 

  

  

  

 see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “liquidity and capital resources” in the 2009 annual report to stockholders pages 46 – 51 

 

   

 regulation risks 

virtually every aspect of northern trust’s business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by regulators including securities regulators domestically and internationally 

 

  

  

  

 see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 of this report 

  

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and the recent volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions has increased this risk 

 

  

 tax and accounting risks 

in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 

 

  

  

  

   

strategic and competitive risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so a variety of risks could interfere with these plans 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance

a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks without this blanket exemption banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the sec and the federal reserve board in september 2007 adopted a regulation to implement the broker activities exemption of the glba that became effective for the bank beginning january 1 2009 the glba also amended the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of glba and the regulations adopted under them

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the united states are subject to regulation by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation by the financial services authority fsa the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the united states are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally northern trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2008 each of northern trust’s nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements 

  

emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 and other marketsupport measures 

in response to the global credit and liquidity crisis impacting financial institutions both domestically and internationally the united states government particularly the us department of the treasury us treasury the federal reserve board and the fdic have taken a number of extraordinary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions including capital injections guarantees of bank liabilities and the creation of special finance facilities on october 3 2008 the united states congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa under which the us treasury is granted broad authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 

the programs announced to date by the us treasury the federal reserve and fdic and other regulatory agencies are in various stages of implementation and continue to evolve to date the corporation’s participation in these various programs has been limited to the capital purchase program cpp under the troubled assets relief program tarp and participation by certain funds advised by a subsidiary of the corporation in the temporary guaranty program for money market funds each of which is described below however the corporation continues to monitor each of the programs announced to date and the other legislative and regulatory developments that continue to emerge in reaction to the global financial crisis and evaluate the need for and the relative advantages and disadvantages to participation by the corporation in those various programs 

troubled assets relief program tarp — under tarp the us treasury has authorized a voluntary cpp to purchase up to 250 billion of senior preferred shares and warrants of qualifying financial institutions that elect to participate on november 14 2008 as part of the cpp the corporation issued and sold to the us treasury i 1576000 shares of the corporation’s fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b without par value and having a liquidation preference of 1000 per share and ii a tenyear warrant to purchase up to 3824624 shares of the corporation’s common stock at an exercise price of 6181 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 1576 billion in cash 

the corporation’s ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of its common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event that the corporation fails to pay or set aside full dividends on the series b preferred stock for all past dividend periods in addition the agreement pursuant to which the preferred shares and the warrant were sold requires regulatory approval for the payment of quarterly dividends on the corporation’s common stock in excess of 028 per share which is the amount of the last regular quarterly dividend declared by the corporation prior to the original issuance of the preferred stock in addition the corporation agreed that until such time as the us treasury ceases to own any of the securities acquired from the corporation the corporation will be subject to certain restrictions with respect to compensation of certain of its senior executive officers on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra was signed into law arra includes additional restrictions on compensation paid to executives and other specified employees of financial institutions that have sold securities to the us treasury pursuant to the tarp program these compensation restrictions under eesa and arra include among other things a prohibition on the payment of “golden parachute payments” a prohibition on the payment of bonuses retention awards and incentive compensation except for certain awards of “longterm” restricted stock and the requirement to establish a companywide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures the specific impact of these restrictions on the corporation is currently uncertain as a number of the provisions remain subject to the issuance of regulations by the us treasury arra also permits participants in the tarp program to redeem the preferred stock held by the us treasury without regard to whether the participant has obtained replacement tier 1 capital and without regard to any waiting period following consultation by the us treasury with the issuer’s banking regulators under the investment agreement pursuant to which the us treasury acquired an issuer’s preferred stock under tarp the issuer had been prohibited from repurchasing the preferred stock for three years unless the issuer had obtained replacement tier 1 capital 

temporary guarantee program for money market mutual funds — in late september 2008 the us treasury opened its temporary guarantee program for money market mutual funds temporary guarantee program the us treasury will guarantee the share price of any publicly–offered eligible money market fund that applies for and pays a fee to participate in the temporary guarantee program the temporary guarantee program is designed to address temporary dislocations in credit markets and will run through april 30 2009 and may be extended beyond that date if approved by the secretary of the treasury if extended it may be extended only up to september 18 2009 and continued insurance protection is contingent upon funds renewing their coverage and paying any additional required fee certain funds advised by a subsidiary of the corporation have participated in this program 

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other 

  

institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be required to make to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve board policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing additionally the agreement pursuant to which the preferred shares and the warrant were sold by the corporation as part of the cpp under tarp requires regulatory approval for the payment of dividends on the common stock in excess of 028 per share per quarter which is the amount of the last regular quarterly dividend declared by the corporation 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

capital adequacy requirements 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items tier 1 capital all of the proceeds of the corporation’s participation in the cpp under tarp will be treated as tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory 

  

convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses tier 2 capital the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its us banking subsidiaries together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 the corporation is subject to the framework for riskbased capital adequacy sometimes referred to as basel ii which was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision and has been endorsed by the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the g10 countries in december 2007 the us bank regulatory agencies published final rules effective april 1 2008 with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework the latest agreedversion of which was released by the basel committee in november 2005 

under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations as a result the corporation and its us depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii the new rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

in order to implement the new rules a core banking organization such as the corporation was required to and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan by october 1 2008 and must satisfactorily complete a fourquarter parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the new basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii the organization must then progress through three transitional periods of at least four quarters each commencing no later than april 1 2011 during these transitional periods the maximum cumulative reduction in capital requirements from those under the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii may not exceed 5 for the first period 10 for the second period and 15 for the third period supervisory approval is required to move through these transitional periods and out of the final transitional period the agencies also have said they will publish a study after the end of the second transitional year that will examine the new framework for any deficiencies 

these changes in the method of calculating capital apply only to riskbased capital requirements the leverage ratio requirements which are not riskbased will continue to apply 

noncore us banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under basel ii the agencies in july 2008 also published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would provide all noncore banking organizations with the option to adopt a standardized approach under basel ii which reflects a simpler methodology than the advanced approaches required of core banking organizations 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation has established a program management office to oversee the implementation of basel ii across the corporation the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and the bank comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted or plan to adopt the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements 

  

preliminary analysis of the basel ii riskbased capital framework suggests that the use of the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework will not result in the corporation’s or the bank’s tier 1 capital or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as “well capitalized” 

prompt corrective action 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

the federal banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2008 the corporation and all of its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

in the release adopting final basel ii rules the federal banking agencies said that these “prompt corrective action” rules will not be affected by the basel ii process and that core banking organizations will be required during the transitional period to use the lowest capital calculation in each category that results from the application of both the new and the old rules 

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

the federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties in addition to the grounds discussed under “prompt corrective action” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business 

we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and 

  

other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so 

this list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive  

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions both in the us and internationally could adversely affect northern trust’s businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation can affect our results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 operational risks 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in recent years we have expanded the operational support located in lowercost areas where the electricity communications and other systems necessary to support our activities may not be as strong as in the us this increases the risk that problems with these systems may occur and disrupt our operations in some of the ways just described resulting in losses 

 

  

  

 these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings 

  

  

  

 credit risks 

a number of northern trust’s product offerings involve credit risk which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us these product offerings include loans leases and other lending commitments 

 

  

 liquidity risks 

northern trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients 

 

  

  

   

 see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “liquidity and capital resources” in the 2008 annual report to stockholders pages 43  47 

 

  

  

 regulation risks 

virtually every aspect of northern trust’s business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by securities regulators domestically and internationally

regulation and supervision 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act bhca as amended by the grammleachbliley act glba consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company each of the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies or continue certain activities

corporation’s new york trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the banking department of the state of new york 

the corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the federal reserve system and are subject to regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ with deposits insured by the fdic to the extent provided by the federal deposit insurance act northern trust bank fsb is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision and the fdic

functional regulation 

enacted in late 1999 the glba established a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks the sec has several times extended the blanket exemption for broker activities by order in order to allow consideration of a regulation to implement this provision of the glba proposed jointly by the sec and the federal reserve board pursuant to the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 without these blanket exemptions banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the sec and the federal reserve board in september 2007 adopted a regulation to implement the broker activities exemption of the glba that will become effective for the bank beginning january 1 2009 until that time the blanket exemption for these activities will remain in place the glba also amended the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of glba and the regulations adopted under them or will take such action prior to the relevant effective date 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the united states are subject to regulation by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting banking investment management fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation under it by the financial services authority fsa the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the united states are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally northern trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2007 each of northern trust’s nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements 

  

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve board policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and shareholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

capital adequacy requirements 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for 

  

bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses “tier 2 capital” the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its us banking subsidiaries together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 the federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to us banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets in addition the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy the agencies also have adopted an adjustment to the riskbased capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions and in september 2006 issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to amendments to these rules the riskbased capital regulations also require us banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk 

in june 2004 the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the g10 countries endorsed a new framework for riskbased capital adequacy sometimes referred to as basel ii which had been developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel ii framework formed the basis upon which the us regulatory authorities developed revisions to existing capital adequacy regulations and standards the latest agreedupon version of the framework was released by the basel committee in november 2005 in december 2007 the us bank regulatory agencies published final rules effective april 1 2008 with respect to implementation of basel ii 

under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of what the agencies expect to be a small number of “core” banking organizations as a result the corporation and its us depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in existing regulations the us bank regulatory agencies permit banks to apply for exemptions from compliance with basel ii rules for subsidiaries where application would not be appropriate based on asset size level of complexity risk profile or scope of operations northern trust intends to apply for such an exemption for northern trust bank fsb the new rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy 

  

in order to implement the new rules a banking organization must satisfactorily complete a fourquarter parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the new rules and existing regulations the organization must then progress through three transitional periods of at least four quarters each during which the maximum cumulative reduction in capital requirements from those under the existing regulations may not exceed 5 for the first period 10 for the second period and 15 for the third period supervisory approval is required to move through these transitional periods and out of the final transitional period the agencies also have said they will publish a study after the end of the second transitional year that will examine the new framework for any deficiencies 

these changes in the method of calculating capital apply only to riskbased capital requirements the leverage ratio requirements which are not riskbased will continue to apply 

noncore us banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under basel ii the agencies have also said that they intend to issue a proposed rule that would provide all noncore banking organizations with the option to adopt a standardized approach under basel ii which reflects a simpler methodology than the advanced approaches required of core banking organizations the agencies have said that this option will replace a prior proposal to afford noncore banking organizations a somewhat more risksensitive version of the current methodology 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation has established a program management office to oversee the implementation of basel ii across the corporation the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and the bank comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporation’s uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted or plan to adopt the standardized approach for calculating capital adequacy 

preliminary analysis of the basel ii riskbased capital framework suggests that the use of the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework will have a positive impact on the corporation’s and the bank’s tier i and total riskbased capital ratios 

prompt corrective action 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

the federal banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2007 the corporation and all of its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

in the release adopting final basel ii rules the federal banking agencies said that these “prompt corrective action” rules will not be affected by the basel ii process and that core banking organizations will be required during the transitional period to use the lowest capital calculation in each category that results from the application of both the new and the old rules 

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

the federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties in addition to the grounds discussed under “prompt corrective action” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business we manage these risks through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls and our ability to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks is itself a risk factor 

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business northern trust’s businesses are affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions both in the us and internationally factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation can affect our results for example a downturn in economic conditions can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses in addition northern trust believes it has profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing any slowing of this globalization or other such trends would adversely affect factors that 

  

have been important in northern trust’s recent growth northern trust’s expanding business activities in emerging markets also presents the risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments 

the fees we earn for managing and servicing our customers’ assets are also affected by general economic conditions for example changes in us or nonus interest rates equity market valuations or debt market valuations as a result of market disruption or illiquidity could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets we manage or service this can affect northern trust’s earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for the corporation’s trust and investment products and services 

the direction and level of interest rates also are important factors since falling rates or rates that remain very low can reduce our net interest margin — the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding this in turn could negatively impact our net interest income and earnings conditions in particular markets including matters such as currency volatility the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowed securities can affect northern trust’s earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending in addition transaction volumes can impact northern trust’s earnings and may vary with economic conditions 

our businesses and earnings also are affected by the monetary and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies for example the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments the actions of the federal reserve board also can affect the value of financial instruments we hold and its policies also can affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 

operational risks 

in our asset servicing investment management and other business activities northern trust effects or processes transactions for clients that involve very large amounts of money many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size scale and scope including human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems breakdowns in processes internal controls or operational infrastructure unsuccessful or difficult implementation of systems upgrades defects in product design or delivery negative developments in relationships with third parties or key employees or associates in our daytoday and ongoing operations as well as external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses or terrorist events our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions may increase the risk that system flaws or human tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect additionally given the high volume of transactions processed by the corporation errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified in recent years we have expanded the operational support located in lower—cost areas where the nature of the infrastructure to support such activities presents greater challenges our business continuity plans address many of these risks but must operate successfully to mitigate them 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings generating riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction failure to do so can generate liability as can failure to manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities or the failure to manage these risks adequately in addition we may find it necessary to take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of rating changes liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing investments these risks are accentuated when credit or equity markets are particularly volatile or when the liquidity in markets is disrupted 

credit risks 

a number of northern trust’s product offerings involve credit risk including loans leases and other lending commitments we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult subjective and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors credit risk levels can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced 

  

demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of borrowers which could impact the borrowers’ ability to repay outstanding loans see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “provision and reserve for credit losses” in the 2007 financial annual report to stockholders pages 30—32 

liquidity risks 

northern trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients events or circumstances such as a loss of confidence of debt purchasers depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with northern trust disruption in the market for debtrelated securities or a significant downgrade of our debt rating may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “liquidity and capital resources” in the 2007 financial annual report to stockholders pages 22—24 

holding company risks 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and its other subsidiaries and it relies primarily on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay dividends there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise if the bank or the other subsidiaries of the corporation were unable to supply the corporation with funds over time it could be unable to meet its various obligations see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 of this report 

regulation risks 

virtually every aspect of northern trust’s business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of its other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations which cover a broad range of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by securities regulators domestically and internationally 

regulatory violations could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business or restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation laws regulations and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities at any time those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully in particular evolving regulations such as the new basel ii capital regime and regulations that generate increased scrutiny such as antimoney laundering procedures can require significant time effort and resources on our part to ensure compliance in a rapidly changing environment new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry including northern trust additionally failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies could adversely affect proposed acquisitions other business opportunities and results of operations see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 of this report 

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise breached a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk cases of this kind can involve substantial claims and be expensive to defend we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and accrue reserves when appropriate by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case 

tax and accounting risks 

in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions in recent years the us internal revenue service has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain types of structured leasing transactions which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations additionally the financial accounting standards board makes pronouncements and 

  

adjustments to its existing accounting guidance that may impact the manner in which the corporation accounts for certain of its transactions 

strategic and competitive risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business as would the failure to execute successfully a significant internal expansion the challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business or significant expansion of an existing business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems our growth also depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies in both pfs and cis and a failure to do so could negatively impact growth 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets in which pricing can be a key competitive factor merger activity in the financial services industry continues to produce large wellcapitalized and geographicallydiverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 

our success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things this helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins an important strategic goal this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities and growth our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results another goal of innovation as a part of our business strategy is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets 

reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance damage to our reputation for delivery of this high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders in northern trust and ultimately affect our ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions the maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in such areas as potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing procedures customer personal information and privacy issues data security recordkeeping regulatory investigations of northern trust or within the banking industry and any litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of northern trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “risk management” “market risk management” and “operational risk management” in the 2007 financial annual report to stockholders pages 24—34 in the section of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in the 2007 financial annual report to stockholders captioned “note 25 contingent liabilities” pages 66—67 and in the sections of “item 1 – business” of this annual report on form 10k captioned “government monetary and fiscal policies” “competition” and “regulation and supervision” pages 3—11 

additionally the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered “forwardlooking statements” of the corporation forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results are also discussed in the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “factors affecting future results” in the 2007 financial annual report to stockholders pages 34—35

 item 3—legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business the corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions including but not limited to actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants regulatory matters employment matters and challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in certain of these actions and proceedings claims for substantial monetary damages or adjustments to recorded tax liabilities are asserted in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly matters that will be decided by a jury and actions that seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories or that involve a large number of parties the corporation cannot state with confidence the eventual outcome of these matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution or estimate the possible loss or range of loss associated with them however based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management does not believe that judgments or settlements in excess of amounts already reserved if any arising from pending or threatened legal actions regulatory matters employment matters or challenges from tax authorities either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the corporation although they could have a material adverse effect on operating results for a particular period

government policies 

the earnings of northern trust are affected by numerous external influences chief among these are general economic conditions both domestic and international and actions that the united states and foreign governments and their central banks take in managing their economies these general conditions affect all of the northern trust’s businesses as well as the quality value and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios 

the board of governors of the federal reserve system is an important regulator of us economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this objective is accomplished by its open market operations in united states government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the composition and use of northern trust’s resources

regulation and supervision 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act bhca as amended by the grammleachbliley act glba consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company each of the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies or continue certain activities 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic and it is subject to regulation by both these entities as well as by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve and is therefore subject 

  

to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve in this area in addition the corporation the bank and the corporation’s new york trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the banking department of the state of new york 

the corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the federal reserve system and the fdic and are subject to regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ northern trust bank fsb is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision and the fdic 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and is a member of the national association of securities dealers inc subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder other subsidiaries are regulated by the connecticut department of banking and the office of the state bank commissioner in delaware two families of mutual funds for which the bank acts as investment adviser and one registered closedend hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 

functional regulation 

enacted in late 1999 the glba established a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks the sec has several times extended the blanket exemption for broker activities by order most recently until july 2 2007 in order to allow consideration of a regulation to implement this provision of the glba proposed jointly by the sec and the federal reserve pursuant to the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 a prior extension of the blanket exemption for dealer activities expired without these blanket exemptions banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the glba also amended the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of glba and the regulations adopted under them to date the outcome of the joint rulemaking relating to the glba’s broker exemption discussed above could require further action 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the united states are subject to regulation by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting investment management banking and assetservicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation under it by the financial services authority fsa the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the united states are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate 

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository 

  

institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and shareholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

capital adequacy requirements 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses “tier 2 capital” the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its banking subsidiaries together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

  

 the federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets in addition the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy the agencies also have adopted an adjustment to the riskbased capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions and in september 2006 issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to amendments to these rules the riskbased capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk 

in june 2004 the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the g10 countries endorsed a new framework for riskbased capital adequacy sometimes referred to as basel ii which had been developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel ii framework forms the basis upon which the us regulatory authorities are developing proposed revisions to existing capital adequacy regulations and standards the latest agreedupon version of the framework was released by the basel committee in november 2005 in september 2006 the us bank regulatory agencies published for comment a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the implementation of basel ii the notice anticipates that the basel ii framework will become fully effective in the united states in january 2009 with transitional arrangements in place for at least the following three years 

the agencies expect that only a small number of large internationally active us banking organizations will be required to use the basel ii framework and that these institutions “mandatory banking organizations” will be permitted to use only the most advanced approaches under basel ii for determining their riskbased capital requirements other us banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under basel ii the notice of proposed rulemaking asks for comment however on whether us banking organizations should be permitted to use any of the other approaches for determining riskbased capital requirements provided for in the basel ii framework 

all other us banking organizations will remain subject to the existing riskbased capital regulations in december 2006 the us bank regulatory agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to a modified version of the existing riskbased capital regulations that banking organizations which do not use basel ii approaches might elect this “basel ia” proposal is designed to make the existing capital regime more risk sensitive without introducing the level of complexity of basel ii the agencies have in the december notice asked for comment on whether organizations otherwise subject to basel ii should be permitted to use alternative approaches to calculating components of capital including the basel ia methodologies the deadline for comments on the basel ii notice of proposed rulemaking has been extended to coincide with the comment deadline on the december 2006 notice the agencies have not proposed to change the leverage ratio requirement which is not riskbased for banking organizations not using the basel ii approaches and the basel ii notice of proposed rulemaking provides that the leverage ratio will continue to apply to organizations that are subject to basel ii 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation is monitoring the status and progress of the revisions to the riskbased capital adequacy guidelines for us banking organizations and evaluating the potential impact on its financial condition and results of operations 

although the us rules related to basel ii have not been finalized under the current guidance northern trust would be a mandatory banking organization and the corporation and the bank would be required to use the basel ii framework in 

  

addition the corporation is addressing issues related to timing differences between the us implementation timeline and timelines in other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation complies with regulatory requirements and expectations in all countries in which it operates 

based on the proposed rules preliminary analysis of the impact of the basel ii riskbased capital framework suggests that the use of the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework would have a positive impact on the corporation’s and the bank’s tier i and total riskbased capital ratios these results are based on preliminary data and could change under the final rules in addition the implementation process has not reached the stage where it would be appropriate for the corporation to seek confirmation from us regulatory agencies that northern trust’s current approach for measurement of regulatory riskbased capital would comply with either the current proposal or future regulatory rules related to the basel ii riskbased capital framework 

prompt corrective action 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2006 the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

the federal banking agencies have said that these “prompt corrective action” rules will not be affected by basel ii process and that banking organizations subject to basel ii will be required during the transitional period to use the lowest capital calculation in each category that results from the application of both the new and the old rules 

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 

the federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties in addition to the grounds discussed under “prompt corrective action” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking 

  

institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business we manage these risks through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls 

economic market and monetary policy risks 

northern trust carries on a global business northern trust’s businesses are affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions both in the us and internationally factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation can affect our results for example a downturn in economic conditions can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit 

  

losses in addition northern trust believes it has profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and securing any slowing of this globalization would adversely affect factors that have been important in northern trust’s recent growth 

the fees we earn for managing and servicing our customers’ assets are also affected by general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in equity markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets we manage or service this can affect northern trust’s earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for the corporation’s trust and investment products and services 

the direction and level of interest rates also are important factors since falling rates or rates that remain very low can reduce our net interest margin — the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding this in turn could negatively impact our net interest income and earnings conditions in particular markets including matters such as currency volatility the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowed securities can affect northern trust’s earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending in addition transaction volumes can impact northern trust’s earnings and may vary with economic conditions 

our businesses and earnings also are affected by the monetary and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies for example the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments the actions of the federal reserve board also can affect the value of financial instruments we hold and its policies also can affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 

operational risks 

in our asset servicing investment management and other business activities northern trust effects or processes transactions for clients that involve very large amounts of money many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size scale and scope including human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems breakdowns in processes internal controls or operational infrastructure defects in product design or delivery negative developments in relationships with third parties or key employees or associates in our daytoday and ongoing operations as well as external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses or terrorist events our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions may increase the risk that system flaws or human tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect additionally given the high volume of transactions processed by the corporation errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified our business continuity plans address many of these risks but must operate successfully to mitigate them 

investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks 

revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings generating returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction failure to do so can generate liability as can failure to manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities or the failure to manage these risks adequately 

credit risks 

a number of northern trust’s product offerings involve credit risk including loans leases and other lending commitments we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult subjective and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors credit risk levels can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of borrowers which could impact the 

  

borrowers’ ability to repay outstanding loans see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “provision for credit losses” in the 2006 financial annual report to stockholders pages 26 — 28 

liquidity risks 

northern trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients events or circumstances such as a loss of confidence of debt purchasers depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with northern trust or a downgrade of our debt rating may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity see the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “liquidity and capital resources” in the 2006 financial annual report to stockholders pages 20 — 21 

holding company risks 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and its other subsidiaries and it relies primarily on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay dividends there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise if the bank or the other subsidiaries of the corporation were unable to supply the corporation with funds over time it could be unable to meet its various obligations see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 of this report 

regulation risks 

virtually every aspect of northern trust’s business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of its other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations which cover a broad range of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by securities regulators domestically and internationally 

regulatory violations could generate penalties result in limitations on our ability to conduct business or restrict our ability to expand laws regulations and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change at any time those changes can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully evolving regulations such as the new basel ii capital regime and antimoney laundering regulations can require significant effort on our part to ensure compliance new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry including northern trust additionally failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies could adversely affect our business opportunities and results of operations see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 of this report 

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise breached a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk cases of this kind can involve substantial claims and be expensive to defend we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case 

tax and accounting risks 

in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions in recent years the us internal revenue service has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain types of structured leasing transactions which could have an adverse 

  

impact on our results of operations additionally the financial accounting standards board makes pronouncements and adjustments to its existing accounting guidance that may impact the manner in which the corporation accounts for certain of its transactions 

strategic and competitive risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business as would the failure to execute successfully a significant internal expansion the challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business or significant expansion of an existing business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems our growth also depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies in both pfs and cis and a failure to do so could negatively impact growth 

we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets merger activity in the financial services industry continues to produce large wellcapitalized and geographicallydiverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 

our success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things this helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins an important strategic goal this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities and growth our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results another goal of innovation as a part of our business strategy is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets 

reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance damage to our reputation for delivery of this high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders in northern trust and ultimately affect our ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions the maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in such areas as potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing procedures customer personal information and privacy issues recordkeeping regulatory investigations of northern trust or within the banking industry and any litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of northern trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “risk management” “market risk management” and “operational risk management” in the 2006 financial annual report to stockholders pages 22—31 in the section of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in the 2006 financial annual report to stockholders captioned “note 24 contingent liabilities” page 62 and in the sections of “item 1 – business” of this annual report on form 10k captioned “government policies” “competition” and “regulation and supervision” pages 6—13 

additionally the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered “forwardlooking statements” of the corporation forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed in more detail in the section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “factors affecting future results” in the 2006 financial annual report to stockholders pages 31—32

 item 3—legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business the corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants regulatory matters and challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in certain of these actions and proceedings claims for substantial monetary damages or adjustments to recorded tax liabilities are asserted in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly actions that seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories or that involve a large number of parties the corporation cannot state with confidence the eventual outcome of these matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution or estimate the possible loss or range of loss associated with them however based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management does not believe that judgments or settlements if any arising from pending or threatened legal actions regulatory matters or challenges from tax authorities either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the corporation although they could have a material adverse effect on operating results for a particular period 

one subsidiary of the corporation was named as a defendant in several enronrelated class action suits that were consolidated under a single complaint in the federal district court for the southern district of texas houston on march 31 2006 the corporation announced that the bank had reached an agreement with counsel for the plaintiffs in the enron lawsuit to seek approval of a settlement of that class action at 375 million all of which was paid by the corporation’s insurance carriers on july 24 2006 the court gave final approval to the settlement and no appeal was filed

government policies 

the earnings of northern trust are affected by numerous external influences chief among these are general economic conditions both domestic and international and actions that the united states and foreign governments and their central banks take in managing their economies these general conditions affect all of the northern trust’s businesses as well as the quality value and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios 

the board of governors of the federal reserve system is an important regulator of us economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this objective is accomplished by its open market operations in united states government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the composition and use of northern trust’s resources 

competition 

the businesses in which northern trust operates are very competitive competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which northern trust conducts operations 

northern trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects as part of this strategy northern trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its competitors in addition northern trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of feebased income and is one of a select group of major bank holding companies in the united states that generates more revenues from feebased services than from net interest income northern trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring feebased revenue by identifying selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to its clients in those markets northern trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet finally northern trust seeks to operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenure 

commercial banks savings banks savings and loan associations and credit unions actively compete for deposits and money market funds and investment banking firms offer depositlike services these institutions as well as consumer and commercial finance companies national retail chains factors insurance companies and pension trusts are important competitors for various types of loans issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans for personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services trust companies investment banking firms insurance companies investment counseling firms and others offer active competition a wide variety of us and nonus companies compete for settlement and other services 

regulation and supervision 

financial holding company regulation 

under us law the corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the bank holding company act bhca as amended by the grammleachbliley act glba consequently the corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations supervision and regulation of bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or creditors 

under the bhca bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking as a financial holding company the corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to 

  

banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the corporation may not however directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

in order to maintain the corporation’s status as a financial holding company each of the corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean depending on the requirements not met that the corporation could not undertake new activities make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies or continue certain activities 

subsidiary regulation 

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic and it is subject to regulation by both these entities as well as by the division of banking of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve in this area in addition the corporation the bank and the corporation’s new york trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the banking department of the state of new york 

the corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the federal reserve system and the fdic and are subject to regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ northern trust bank fsb is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision and the fdic 

the corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the federal reserve its brokerdealer subsidiary is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and is a member of the national association of securities dealers inc subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies several subsidiaries of the corporation are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder other subsidiaries are regulated by the connecticut department of banking and the office of the state bank commissioner in delaware two families of mutual funds for which the bank acts as investment adviser and one registered closedend hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the sec under the investment company act of 1940 

functional regulation 

enacted in late 1999 the glba established a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators 

a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks the sec has several times extended the blanket exemption for broker activities by order and requested comments on proposed implementing regulations a prior extension of the blanket exemption for dealer activities has expired without these blanket exemptions banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the glba also amended the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of glba and the regulations adopted under them to date additional sec rulemaking relating to the glba’s broker exemption discussed above could require further action 

nonus regulation 

the increasingly important activities of the corporation’s subsidiaries outside the united states are subject to regulation by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting investment management banking and assetservicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation under it by the financial services authority fsa the fsa exercises broad supervisory and 

  

disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations the suspension of registered employees and censures and fines for both regulated businesses and their regulated employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the united states are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate 

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

payment of dividends 

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and shareholder approval 

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

capital adequacy requirements 

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance 

  

sheet items such as standby letters of credit is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses “tier 2 capital” the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its banking subsidiaries together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

 

 the federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets in addition the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy the agencies also have adopted an adjustment to the riskbased capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions the riskbased capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk 

in june 2004 the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the g10 countries endorsed a new framework for riskbased capital adequacy sometimes referred to as basel ii which had been developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel ii framework forms the basis upon which the us regulatory authorities are developing proposed revisions to existing capital adequacy regulations and standards in august 2003 the us bank regulatory agencies published for notice and comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking discussing possible revisions to riskbased capital adequacy regulations relating to an earlier version of basel ii the latest agreedupon version of the framework was released by the basel committee in november 2005 the agencies anticipate that the basel ii framework will become fully effective in the united states in january 2009 with transitional arrangements in place for at least the following three years 

the agencies expect that only a small number of large internationally active us banking organizations will be required to use the basel ii framework and that these institutions “mandatory banking organizations” will be permitted to use only the most 

  

advanced approaches under basel ii for determining their riskbased capital requirements other us banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under basel ii all other us banking organizations will remain subject to the existing riskbased capital regulations in october 2005 the us agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to possible changes in the existing riskbased capital regulations for banking organizations that do not use basel ii approaches the agencies have not proposed to change the leverage ratio requirement which is not riskbased for banking organizations not using the basel ii approaches and have indicated that it will continue to apply to organizations that are subject to basel ii 

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation is monitoring the status and progress of the revisions to the riskbased capital adequacy guidelines for us banking organizations and evaluating the potential impact on its financial condition and results of operations 

although the us rules related to basel ii have not been finalized under the current guidance northern trust would be a mandatory banking organization in addition the corporation is addressing issues related to timing differences between the us implementation timeline and timelines in other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation complies with regulatory requirements and expectations in all countries in which it operates 

based on the proposed rules preliminary analysis of the impact of the basel ii riskbased capital framework suggests that the use of the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework would have a positive impact on the corporation’s tier i and total riskbased capital ratios these results are based on preliminary data and could change under the final rules in addition the implementation process has not reached the stage where it would be appropriate for the corporation to seek confirmation from us regulatory agencies that northern trust’s current approach for measurement of regulatory riskbased capital would comply with either the current proposal or future regulatory rules related to the basel ii riskbased capital framework 

prompt corrective action 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things

 item 1a—risk factors 

from an investor’s standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each company’s unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trust’s business we manage these risks through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls 

economic risks 

northern trust carries on a global business changes in the world economy or in the economies of the us or other countries or regions can affect our results for example a downturn in the us economy can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate falling equity markets generally affect northern trust earnings negatively since a 

  

significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values the direction and level of interest rates also are important factors since falling rates or rates that remain very low can reduce or reduce growth in net interest income levels economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment and savings patterns all of which may impact northern trust’s business conditions in particular markets including matters such as currency volatility and the demand for borrowed securities can affect northern trust’s earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending in addition transaction volumes can impact northern trust’s earnings and may vary with economic conditions 

operating risks 

in our asset servicing investment management and other business activities northern trust effects or processes transactions for clients that involve very large amounts of money human errors or omissions systems defects systems interruptions and breakdowns in processes or internal controls can result in significant exposure external events including natural disasters epidemics or terrorist events can similarly impact operations creating exposure 

investment performance and fiduciary risks 

revenues from our investment management and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings generating returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business administering or managing assets in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction and failure to do so can generate liability 

regulation risks 

virtually every aspect of northern trust’s business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions regulatory violations could generate penalties result in limitations on our ability to conduct business or restrict our ability to expand changes in regulation also can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully evolving regulations such as the new basel ii capital regime and antimoney laundering regulations can require significant effort on our part to ensure compliance new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial institutions industry including northern trust 

litigation risks 

our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise breached a duty owed to them our trust and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk cases of this kind can involve substantial claims and be expensive to defend we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case developments in a particular case may also impact services that we provide to others 

strategic risks 

we have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business as would the failure to execute successfully any significant internal expansion growth also depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies in both pfs and cis and a failure to do so could negatively impact growth 

we do business in competitive markets that require consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is either to generate new products or more effective service delivery that will help us compete successfully for new clients or additional business from existing clients innovation as a part of our business strategy also produces efficiencies in operations that will help us reduce and control costs including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities and growth 

reputation risks 

an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance many of the risks described above would if our plans and processes for 

  

controlling or mitigating them are not successful damage our reputation for delivering the expected service and consequently undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders in northern trust and ultimately affect our ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions 

many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” captioned “risk management” “market risk management” and “operational risk management” in the 2005 financial annual report to stockholders pages 20  30 in the section of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in the 2005 financial annual report to stockholders captioned “note 25 contingent liabilities” pages 62 – 63 and in the sections of “item 1 – business” of the 2005 annual report on form 10k captioned “government policies” “competition” and “regulation and supervision” pages 6  13

functional regulation 

  

enacted in late 1999 the glba established a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks the sec has extended the blanket exemption for broker activities by order a prior extension of the blanket exemption for dealer activities has expired without these blanket exemptions banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the glba also amended the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of glba and the regulations adopted under them to date additional sec rulemaking relating to the glba’s broker exemption discussed above could require additional action 

  

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

  

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

  

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

  

payment of dividends 

  

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

  

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

  

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and shareholder approval 

  

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

  

capital adequacy requirements 

  

the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses “tier 2 capital” the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

  

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its banking subsidiaries together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “wellcapitalized” are provided in the following chart 

  

   

the federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets in addition the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy the agencies also have adopted an adjustment to the riskbased capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions the riskbased capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk 

  

in june 2004 the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the g10 countries endorsed a new framework for riskbased capital adequacy sometimes referred to as basel ii which had been developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel ii framework will form the basis upon which the domestic regulatory authorities will develop proposed revisions to existing capital adequacy regulations and standards in august 2003 the us bank regulatory agencies published for notice and comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking discussing possible revisions to riskbased capital adequacy regulations relating to an earlier version of basel ii after the publication of the final version of the basel ii framework the us agencies announced that they will continue this rulemaking process and expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter of 2006 the agencies anticipate that the basel ii framework will become fully effective in the united states in january 2008 

  

the agencies expect that only a small number of large internationally active us banking organizations will be required to use the basel ii framework and that these institutions will be permitted to use only the most advanced approaches under basel ii for determining their riskbased capital requirements other us banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under basel ii all other us banking organizations will remain subject to the existing riskbased capital regulations the us agencies have announced that they expect to review the existing riskbased capital regulations so that possible changes could become effective at the same time as the basel ii framework 

  

the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework the corporation is monitoring the status and progress of the revisions to the riskbased capital adequacy guidelines for domestic banks and evaluating the potential impact on its financial condition and results of operations 

  

prompt corrective action 

  

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions 

  

including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

  

the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2004 the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized”

the board of governors of the federal reserve system is an important regulator of domestic economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this objective is accomplished by its open market operations in united states government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the composition and use of northern trust’s resources

functional regulation 

  

enacted in late 1999 the glba establishes a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amends the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the exchange act to remove the blanket exemption for banks although the sec has extended the blanket exemption by order when the extensions expire banks will be able to conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the glba also amends the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds 

  

the corporation has completed an evaluation of its securities activities particularly the fiduciary aspects of these activities in light of the amendments to the exchange act and the investment advisers act of 1940 discussed above to determine what if any 

  

additional registrations may be required and whether certain activities currently engaged in should instead be conducted by one of its nonbanking affiliates the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions in light of this evaluation additional sec rulemaking relating to the glba’s brokerdealer exemptions discussed above could require additional evaluation 

  

on october 30 2003 the corporation filed the necessary declaration with the federal reserve board to become a financial holding company as permitted by glba the declaration was approved and became effective on november 20 2003 financial holding companies are permitted to engage in those activities that the federal reserve board working with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies subject to significant limitations they also include activities previously determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 

  

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

  

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each may also be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

  

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve policy it would not otherwise be provided the corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

  

payment of dividends 

  

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

  

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

  

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net profits state member banks may also be subject to similar restrictions imposed by the laws of the states in which they are chartered 

  

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

  

capital adequacy requirements 

  

the federal reserve board has adopted riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is 8 percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses “tier 2 capital” the federal reserve board has also adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least 3 percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

  

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and its banking subsidiaries are provided in the following chart 

  

   

the federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets in addition the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy the agencies have also adopted an adjustment to the riskbased capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions the riskbased capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk 

  

the bank regulatory authorities of several nations individually and through the basel committee on banking supervision committee have proposed for comment and are considering changes to the riskbased capital adequacy framework that could affect the capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks in october 2003 the committee announced its intention to finalize the new basel capital accord bca by no later than midyear 2004 with implementation of the bca capital adequacy framework by yearend 2006 the corporation is monitoring the status and progress of the proposed rules and has over several years been engaged in preparing to qualify for the approaches to calculating minimum regulatory capital under the bca that us regulators have proposed to adopt 

  

prompt corrective action 

  

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

  

the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2003 the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

  

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies

the board of governors of the federal reserve system is an important regulator of domestic economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this objective is accomplished by its open market operations in united states government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the composition and use of northern trust’s resources

the businesses in which northern trust operates are very competitive competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which northern trust conducts operations 

  

northern trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted markets in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects as part of this strategy northern trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its competitors in addition northern trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of feebased income and is one of a select group of major bank holding companies in the united states that generates more revenues from feebased services than from net interest income northern trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring feebased revenue by identifying selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to its clients in those markets northern trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet finally northern trust seeks to operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenure

regulation and supervision 

  

bank holding company act 

  

the corporation is subject to the supervision examination and regulation of the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act bhca the bhca and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations as a bank holding company the corporation’s activities and those of its banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking and the corporation may not directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company including a bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 

  

supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance funds of the fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of bank holding company stockholders or creditors the banking regulators have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violation of laws and regulations 

  

subsidiary regulation 

  

the bank is a member of the federal reserve system its deposits are insured by the fdic and it is subject to regulation by both these entities as well as by the illinois office of banks and real estate the bank is also a member of and subject to the rules of the chicago clearinghouse association and is registered as a government 

  

securities dealer in accordance with the government securities act of 1986 as a government securities dealer its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the department of the treasury the bank is registered as a transfer agent with the federal reserve and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the federal reserve in this area 

  

the corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the federal reserve system and the fdic and are subject to regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency northern trust bank fsb is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision and the fdic

functional regulation 

  

enacted in late 1999 the grammleachbliley act glba establishes a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glba relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things the glba amends the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the securities exchange act of 1934 to remove the blanket exemption for banks banks now may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the sec issued interim final rules to define certain terms in and grant additional exemptions from the provisions of the glba in may 2001 by order the sec has extended the blanket exemption for banks from the definition of “dealer” until february 10 2003 and from the definition of “broker” until may 12 2003 the sec expects to amend its interim final rules and extend the temporary exemptions as appropriate the glba also amends the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds 

  

the corporation has completed an evaluation of its securities activities particularly the fiduciary aspects of these activities in light of the amendments to the securities exchange act of 1934 and the investment advisers 

  

act of 1940 discussed above to determine what if any additional registrations may be required and whether certain activities currently engaged in should instead be conducted by one of its nonbanking affiliates the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions in light of this evaluation nonetheless additional sec rulemaking relating to the glba’s brokerdealer exemptions discussed above could require additional evaluation 

  

the corporation has not elected to become a financial holding company and would expect to do so if and when it proposes to conduct outside a financial subsidiary one of the activities specifically authorized for financial holding companies by the glba or if it would be more expeditious to conduct its current activities by means of a financial holding company the corporation does expect that the affiliations and activities permitted financial services organizations will over time change the nature of its competition but it is not possible to predict the full nature and effect of the changes that may occur 

  

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act 

  

under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each may also be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions “default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the corporation’s other banking subsidiaries this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions of the fdia 

  

under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when absent this federal reserve policy the corporation may not be inclined to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 

  

payment of dividends 

  

the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or other cash flow requirements 

  

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health such as by borrowing 

  

  

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net profits state member banks may also be subject to similar restrictions imposed by the laws of the states in which they are chartered 

  

the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

  

capital adequacy requirements 

  

the federal reserve board has adopted riskbased capital guidelines for bank holding companies the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is 8 percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt other perpetual preferred stock hybrid capital instruments mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses “tier 2 capital” the federal reserve board has also adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least 3 percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets 

  

the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the capital ratios for the corporation and its banking subsidiaries are provided in the following chart 

  

   

the federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making 

  

acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets in addition the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy the agencies have also adopted an adjustment to the riskbased capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions the riskbased capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk 

  

domestic bank regulatory authorities and international bank supervisory organizations principally the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed for comment and are considering changes to the riskbased capital adequacy framework that could affect the capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks in december 2001 the committee indicated its desire to issue a new consultative package on the new basel capital accord bca in july 2002 the committee announced its intention to finalize the new bca in the fourth quarter of 2003 with implementation of the bca capital adequacy framework by yearend 2006 the corporation is monitoring the status and progress of the proposed rule and evaluating the potential impact the bca if adopted would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation and its banking subsidiaries 

  

prompt corrective action 

  

under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits undercapitalized institutions may not accept renew or roll over brokered deposits 

  

the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or in certain cases required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories depending on the level of an institution’s capital the agency’s corrective powers include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless among other things the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled 

  

to a priority of payment in bankruptcy failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and restrictions on certain business activities as of december 31 2002 the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized” 

  

enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies

                               government policies

     the earnings of northern trust are affected by numerous external
influences chief among these are general economic conditions both domestic and
international and actions that the united states and foreign governments and
their central banks take in managing their economies these general conditions
affect all of the northern trusts businesses as well as the quality value and
profitability of their loan and investment portfolios

     the board of governors of the federal reserve system is an important
regulator of domestic economic conditions and has the general objective of
promoting orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this
objective is accomplished by its open market operations in united states
government securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks
may borrow from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve
requirements for deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may
strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and
investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other
purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the
composition and use of northern trusts resources

                                   competition

     northern trusts principal business strategy is to provide quality
financial services to targeted markets in which it believes it has a competitive
advantage and favorable growth prospects as part of this strategy northern
trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it
from its competitors in addition northern trust emphasizes the development and
growth of recurring sources of feebased income and is one of a select group of
major bank holding companies in the united states that generates more revenues
from feebased services than from net interest income northern trust seeks to
develop and expand its recurring feebased revenue by identifying selected
markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of
individualized service to its clients in those markets northern trust also
seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures
and to maintain a conservative balance sheet finally northern trust seeks to
operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad
experience and long tenure

     active competition exists in all principal areas in which northern trust
presently engages in business cis is a leading provider of master trust and
custody services the primary providers in this market in addition to northern
trust are state street corporation the bank of new york company inc mellon
financial corporation j p morgan chase  co deutsche bank ag and
citigroup inc in providing commercial banking and treasury management services
northern trust competes with domestic and foreign banks within the middle
market segment northern trusts competitors are primarily other chicago banks
including bank one corporation lasalle bank na and harris bankcorp inc
credit services especially those provided to fortune 500 companies face
increased competition due to the general trend for corporations to rely more
upon direct access to the credit and capital markets such as through the direct
issuance of commercial paper and less upon traditional financial intermediaries
such as commercial banks

     pfs competition is specific to each geographic market but typically
consists of local banks and trust companies brokerage firms mutual fund firms
and asset management companies in the chicago area northern trust has the
leading share of the personal trust market

                           regulation and supervision

bank holding company act

     the corporation is a bank holding company subject to the bank holding
company act of 1956 as amended the bhca and to regulation by the board of
governors of the federal reserve system the bhca limits the activities which
may be engaged in by the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries to those so
closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper
incident thereto also under section 106 of the 1970 amendments to the bhca and
subject to certain exceptions subsidiary banks are prohibited from engaging in
certain tiein arrangements with nonbanking affiliates in connection with any
extension of credit or provision of any property or services

     the bhca also prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring substantially
all the assets of or owning more than 5 of the voting shares of any bank or
nonbanking company which is not already majority owned without prior approval of
the board of governors

grammleachbliley act

     enacted in late 1999 the grammleachbliley act the glb act
significantly changed financial services regulation by expanding permissible
nonbanking activities of bank holding companies and removing certain barriers to
affiliations among banks insurance companies securities firms and other
financial services entities these activities can be conducted through a holding
company structure or in the case of many of these activities through a
financial subsidiary of a bank the glb act also establishes a system of federal
and state regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary
regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the
federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for
that activity banking is supervised by banking regulators insurance by state
insurance regulators and securities activities by the securities and exchange
commission sec and state securities regulators the glb act also establishes a
minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions
requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer
information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to
third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and
disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to the glb act the glb act also
requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate
to the community reinvestment act and contains various other provisions
designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while
maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry

     the glb act repealed the antiaffiliation provisions of the glasssteagall
act and revised the bhca to permit qualifying holding companies called
financial holding companies to engage in or to affiliate with companies
engaged in a full range of financial activities including banking insurance
activities including insurance underwriting and portfolio investing
securities activities merchant banking and additional activities that are
financial in nature incidental to financial activities or in certain
circumstances complementary to financial activities a bank holding companys
subsidiary banks must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and have at least
a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating for the bank holding company
to elect status as a federal securities financial holding company the
corporations banking subsidiaries currently meet these requirements

     a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glb
act relates to the application of laws and sec oversight of some bank securities
activities previously exempt from brokerdealer regulation among other things
the glb act amends the definitions of broker and dealer under the securities
exchange act of 1934 to remove the blanket exemption for banks banks now may
conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the
activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow
banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily
banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as
a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer
affiliate interim final rules of the sec currently defer the time for
compliance with these provisions of the glb act until may 12 2002 these
interim final rules are subject to further revision the glb act also amended
the investment advisers act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or
separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for
mutual funds

     the corporation has completed its evaluation of the effects of the glb act
on its activities the bank and the corporations other banking subsidiaries
have also evaluated their securities activities particularly the fiduciary

aspects of those activities in light of the amendments to the securities
exchange act of 1934 and the investment advisers act of 1940 discussed above to
determine what if any additional registrations may be required and whether
certain activities currently engaged in by any of the banks should instead be
conducted by a nonbanking affiliate the corporation believes that it has taken
the necessary actions in light of this evaluation

     the corporation has not elected to become a financial holding company and
would expect to do so if and when it proposes to conduct outside a financial
subsidiary one of the activities specifically authorized for financial holding
companies by the glb act the corporation does expect that the affiliations and
activities permitted financial services organizations will over time change the
nature of its competition but it is not possible to predict the full nature and
effect of the changes that may occur

capital regulation

     under the fdics riskbased insurance assessment system each insured bank
is placed in one of nine risk categories based on its level of capital and other
relevant information each insured banks insurance assessment rate is then
determined by the risk category in which it has been classified by the fdic
there is currently a 27 basis point spread between the highest and lowest
assessment rates so that banks classified as strongest by the fdic are subject
in 2002 to no insurance assessment and banks classified as weakest by the fdic
are subject to an insurance assessment rate of 27 in addition to its
insurance assessment each insured bank is subject in 2002 to quarterly debt
service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation
that financed the federal savings and loans bailout the first quarter 2002 debt
service assessment was 0182

     the federal bank regulators have adopted riskbased capital guidelines for
bank holding companies and banks the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital
to riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items total
capital ratio is 8 the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted
assets tier 1 capital ratio is 4 tier 1 capital means that portion of
total capital that is comprised of common stock related surplus retained
earnings noncumulative perpetual preferred stock minority interests and for
bank holding companies a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual
preferred stock less certain intangibles including goodwill the balance of
total capital tier 2 capital may consist of other preferred stock certain
other instruments limited amounts of unrealized gains on equity securities and
limited amounts of subordinated debt and the loan and lease loss allowance

     the federal reserve board riskbased capital standards contemplate that
evaluation of capital adequacy will consider other factors including overall
interest rate exposure liquidity funding and market risks the quality and
level of earnings investment loan portfolio and other concentrations of
credit certain risks arising from nontraditional activities the quality of
loans and investments the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and
managements overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating
risks

     in addition the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio
tier 1 capital to quarterly average total assets guidelines for bank holding
companies and banks these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3
for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified criteria
including having the highest regulatory rating all other banking organizations
are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4 the guidelines also
provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially
above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible
assets furthermore the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve board will
continue to consider a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals
for expansion or new activities the tangible tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio
of tier 1 capital less intangibles not deducted from tier 1 capital to
quarterly average total assets as of december 31 2001 the federal reserve had
not advised the corporation of any specific minimum tangible tier 1 leverage
ratio applicable to it at december 31 2001 the corporation had a tangible
tier 1 leverage ratio of 79

     domestic bank regulatory authorities and international bank supervisory
organizations principally the basel committee on banking supervision
committee have proposed for comment and are considering changes to the
riskbased capital adequacy framework that could affect the capital guidelines
applicable to bank holding companies and banks in december 2001 the committee
indicated its desire to issue a new consultative package on the new basel
capital accord bca and to complete the bca by yearend 2002 with
implementation of the

bca capital adequacy framework beginning in 2005 the corporation is monitoring
the status and progress of the proposed rule and evaluating the potential impact
the bca if adopted would have on the financial condition or results of the
operations of the corporation and its banking subsidiaries

crossguarantees under the federal deposit insurance act

     under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured
depository institutions are under common control each of those depository
institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in connection with the default
of any of the others each may also be liable for any assistance the fdic
provides to the other institutions default means the appointment of a
conservator or receiver for the institution thus any of the corporations
banking subsidiaries could be liable to the fdic if the fdic were to suffer a
loss in connection with any of the corporations other banking subsidiaries
this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution
would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured
obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation
subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations
owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions
although neither the corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be
assessed for such loss under the fdia the corporation has agreed to indemnify
each of its banking subsidiaries other than the bank for any payments a
banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the fdic pursuant to these provisions
of the fdia

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act

     in addition to the effects of the provisions described above the federal
deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 fdicia substantially
revised the depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of fdia and
made revisions to several other federal banking statutes

     under fdicia the federal banking regulators must take prompt supervisory
and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions fdicia
establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized
undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically
undercapitalized a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon how
its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain
other factors as established by regulation

     under current regulations an fdicinsured bank is defined to be well
capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio tier 1 capital to quarterly
average total assets of at least 5 a total capital ratio qualifying total
capital to riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items of
at least 10 and a tier 1 capital ratio tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets
of at least 6 and is not otherwise in a troubled condition as specified by
its appropriate federal regulatory agency a bank is generally considered to be
adequately capitalized if it is not defined to be well capitalized but meets all
of its minimum capital requirementsthat is if it has a leverage ratio of 4
or greater or a leverage ratio of 3 or greater if the institution is rated in
the top category in its most recent report of examination a total capital
ratio of 8 or greater and a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 or greater a bank will
be considered undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required measure
significantly undercapitalized if it is significantly below that measure and
critically undercapitalized if it maintains a level of tangible equity capital
equal to or less than 2 of total assets a bank may be reclassified to be in
the category that is next below that indicated by its actual capital position if
it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating by its examiners with
respect to its assets management earnings liquidity or sensitivity to market
risk that has not been corrected or it is determined that the bank is in an
unsafe or unsound condition or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice

     at december 31 2001 the bank and each of the corporations other
subsidiary banks met or exceeded the minimum regulatory ratios that are among
the conditions for them to be considered well capitalized for further

distribution including payment of dividends or paying any management fee to
its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth
limitations and are required to

submit a capital restoration plan if a depository institution fails to submit
an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized

     under fdicia a bank that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited
from accepting or renewing brokered deposits except with a waiver from the
fdic and offering interest rates on brokered deposits significantly higher than
the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon
where the deposits are solicited in addition passthrough insurance
coverage may not be available for certain employee benefit accounts

     significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a
number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient
voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically
undercapitalized depository institutions may be restricted from making payments
of principal and interest on subordinated debt and are subject to appointment of
a receiver or conservator

                              government policies

  the earnings of northern trust are affected by numerous external influences
chief among these are general economic conditions both domestic and
international and actions that the united states and foreign governments and
their central banks take in managing their economies these general conditions
affect all of the northern trusts businesses as well as the quality value and
profitability of their loan and investment portfolios

  the board of governors of the federal reserve system is an important regulator
of domestic economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting
orderly economic growth in the united states implementation of this objective
is accomplished by its open market operations in united states government
securities its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow
from federal reserve banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for
deposits the policies adopted by the federal reserve board may strongly
influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and
investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other
purchased funds fiscal policies in the united states and abroad also affect the
composition and use of northern trusts resources

                                  competition

  northern trusts principal business strategy is to provide quality financial
services to targeted markets in which it believes it has a competitive advantage
and favorable growth prospects as part of this strategy northern trust seeks
to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its
competitors in addition northern trust emphasizes the development and growth
of recurring sources of feebased income and is one of a select group of major
bank holding companies in the united states that generates more revenues from
feebased services than from net interest income northern trust seeks to
develop and expand its recurring feebased revenue by identifying selected
markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of
individualized service to its clients in those markets northern trust also
seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures
and to maintain a conservative balance sheet finally northern trust seeks to
operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad
experience and long tenure

  active competition exists in all principal areas in which northern trust
presently engages in business cis is a leading provider of master trust and
custody services the primary providers in this market in addition to northern
trust are state street corporation the bank of new york company inc mellon
financial corporation j p morgan chase  co deutsche bank ag and
citigroup inc in providing commercial banking and treasury management services
northern trust competes with domestic and foreign banks within the middle
market segment northern trusts competitors are primarily the other chicago
banks including bank one corporation lasalle bank na and harris bankcorp
inc credit services especially those provided to fortune 500 companies face
increased competition due to the general trend for corporations to rely more
upon direct access to the credit and capital markets such as through the direct
issuance of commercial paper and less upon traditional financial intermediaries
such as commercial banks

  pfs competition is specific to each geographic market but typically consists
of local banks and trust companies brokerage firms mutual fund firms and asset
management companies in the chicago area northern trust has the leading share
of the personal trust market and in florida northern trust is the second
largest provider of personal trust services us trust corporation a banking
organization with a strategy similar to that of pfs which was acquired by the
charles schwab corporation in 2000 competes with pfs in certain markets

                          regulation and supervision
bank holding company act

  the corporation is a bank holding company subject to the bank holding company
act of 1956 as amended the bhca and to regulation by the board of governors
of the federal reserve system the bhca limits the activities which may be
engaged in by the corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries to those so
closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper
incident thereto also under section 106 of the 1970



                                       7

amendments to the bhca and subject to certain exceptions subsidiary banks are
prohibited from engaging in certain tiein arrangements with nonbanking
affiliates in connection with any extension of credit or provision of any
property or services

  the bhca also prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring substantially
all the assets of or owning more than 5 of the voting shares of any bank or
nonbanking company which is not already majority owned without prior approval of
the board of governors

grammleachbliley act

  on november 12 1999 the president signed into law the grammleachbliley act
the glb act the glb act significantly changes financial services regulation
by expanding permissible nonbanking activities of bank holding companies and
removing certain legal barriers to affiliations among banks insurance
companies securities firms and other financial services entities these new
activities can be conducted through a holding company structure or subject to
certain limitations through a financial subsidiary of a bank the glb act also
establishes a system of federal and state regulation based on functional
regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity
will generally reside with the federal or state regulator designated as having
the principal responsibility for that activity banking is to be supervised by
banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities
activities by the sec and state securities regulators the glb act also
establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other
provisions requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect
to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to consumer
information the glb act also requires the disclosure of agreements reached with
community groups that relate to the community reinvestment act and contains
various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services
to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial
services industry

  the glb act repeals the antiaffiliation provisions of the glasssteagall act
and revises the bhca to permit qualifying holding companies called financial
holding companies to engage in or to affiliate with companies engaged in a
full range of financial activities including banking insurance activities
including insurance underwriting and portfolio investing securities
activities merchant banking and additional activities that are financial in
nature incidental to financial activities or in certain circumstances
complementary to financial activities a bank holding companys subsidiary banks
must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and have at least a satisfactory
community reinvestment act rating for the bank holding company to elect status
as a financial holding company the corporations banking subsidiaries currently
meet these requirements

  a significant component of the functional regulation provided in the glb act
relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of bank
securities activities previously subject to blanket exemptions among other
things the glb act amends the definitions of broker and dealer under the
securities exchange act of 1934 to remove the blanket exemption for banks
following effectiveness of these amendments in may 2001 banks will be able to
conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the
activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow
banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily
banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions
will as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer
affiliate the glb act also amends effective may 2001 the investment advisers
act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable
division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds

  the corporation has completed its evaluation of the effects of the glb act on
its activities the bank and the corporations other banking subsidiaries have
also evaluated their securities activities particularly fiduciary activities
in light of the amendments to the securities exchange act of 1934 and the
investment advisers act of 1940 discussed above to determine what if any
additional registrations may be required and whether certain activities
currently engaged in by any of the banks should instead be conducted by a
nonbanking affiliate as a consequence of the glb act the investment adviser
for the corporations proprietary mutual funds must be a registered investment
adviser and a number of the corporations employees engaging in securities
brokerage activities who were not previously registered must become registered
these actions have been or are being taken the corporation has not elected to
become a financial holding company and would expect to do so if and when it
proposes to conduct outside a financial subsidiary one of the activities
specifically authorized for financial



                                       8

holding companies by the glb act the corporation does expect that the
affiliations and activities permitted financial services organizations will over
time change the nature of its competition but it is not possible to predict the
full nature and effect of the changes that may occur

  the interstate act permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed
bank holding company to acquire with federal reserve board approval a bank

capital regulation

  under the fdics riskbased insurance assessment system each insured bank is
placed in one of nine risk categories based on its level of capital and other
relevant information each insured banks insurance assessment rate is then
determined by the risk category in which it has been classified by the fdic
there is currently a 27 basis point spread between the highest and lowest
assessment rates so that banks classified as strongest by the fdic are subject
in 2001 to no insurance assessment and banks classified as weakest by the fdic
are subject to an insurance assessment rate of 27 in addition to its
insurance assessment each insured bank is subject in 2001 to quarterly debt
service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation
that financed the federal savings and loans bailout the first quarter 2001 debt
service assessment was 0196

  the federal bank regulators have adopted riskbased capital guidelines for
bank holding companies and banks the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital
to riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items total
capital ratio is 8 the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted
assets tier 1 capital ratio is 4 tier 1 capital means that portion of
total capital that is comprised of common stock related surplus retained
earnings noncumulative perpetual preferred stock minority interests and for
bank holding companies a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual
preferred stock less certain intangibles including goodwill the balance of
total capital tier 2 capital may consist of other preferred stock certain
other instruments limited amounts of unrealized gains on equity securities and
limited amounts of subordinated debt and the loan and lease loss allowance

  the federal reserve board riskbased capital standards contemplate that
evaluation of capital adequacy will consider other factors including overall
interest rate exposure liquidity funding and market risks the quality and
level of earnings investment loan portfolio and other concentrations of
credit certain risks arising from nontraditional activities the quality of
loans and investments the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and
managements overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating
risks

1 capital to quarterly average total assets guidelines for bank holding
companies and banks these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3
for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified criteria
including having the highest regulatory rating all other banking organizations
are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4 the guidelines also
provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially
above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible
assets furthermore the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve board will
continue to consider a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals
for expansion or new activities the tangible tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio
of tier 1 capital less intangibles not deducted from tier 1 capital to
quarterly average total assets as of december 31 2000 the federal reserve had
not advised the corporation of any specific minimum tangible tier 1 leverage
ratio applicable to it at december 31 2000 the corporation had a tangible
tier 1 leverage ratio of 69

undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required measure significantly
undercapitalized if it is significantly below that measure and critically
undercapitalized if it maintains a level of tangible equity capital equal to or
less than 2 of total assets a bank may be reclassified to be in the category
that is next below that indicated by its actual capital position if it receives

distribution including payment of dividends or paying any management fee to
its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth
limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan if a
depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if
it is significantly undercapitalized
