we operate 90 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations a technical and development center 10 regional design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 90 manufacturing facilities 59 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products 30 are sheet plants which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products and one is a corrugated sheetonly manufacturer 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs each of our plants serves a market radius of approximately 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both virgin wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills and all of our fiber comes from renewable resources our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2021 our usage of recycled fiber net of internal generation represents 18 of our containerboard production in order to improve our fiber flexibility and production capabilities we have invested in additional capacity to process recycled fiber at our deridder wallula and jackson mills 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future 

  

as part of our renewable virgin fiber sourcing efforts we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc ®  and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas purchased wood waste and other purchased fuels each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2021 our packaging mills consumed about 81 million mmbtus of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 81 million mmbtus consumed about 61 was from millgenerated biogenic fuels that are byproducts of our containerboard manufacturing and pulping process and 39 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 81 was from natural gas 18 was from purchased wood waste and 1 was from other purchased fuels 

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard including caustic soda sulfuric acid soda ash and lime most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution 

our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products we have experienced higher freight costs in 2021 due to truck and driver shortages and limited boxcar availability as well as fuel surcharges 

customers 

we sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 15000 customers in approximately 33000 locations about 70 of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales 

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2020 fibre box association annual report 

 

   

  

competition 

as of december 31 2021 we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 445 us companies operating approximately 1150 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper westrock company georgiapacific llc and pratt industries however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent producers 

pap er 

we are a leading producer of ufs in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content our papers consist of communication papers including cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers our products are sustainable and are produced from renewable raw materials predominately using energy derived from biogenic fuels in our production processes and are recyclable at endoflife 

facilities 

we currently have two paper mills located in the united states with the capacity to produce 602000 tons annually our operations include the following 

international falls our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

jackson our jackson alabama mill has historically produced ufs and has the capability to produce both commodity and specialty papers on its no 1 and no 3 machines since october 2020 the mill has also produced containerboard see packaging — facilities — jackson for further information 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment we consume wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchase and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements 

as part of our renewable virgin fiber sourcing efforts we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc ®  and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

energy supply we obtain energy through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas electricity and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity 

in 2021 our paper mills consumed about 12 million mmbtus of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 12 million mmbtus consumed about 75 was from millgenerated biogenic fuels that are byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process and 25 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 95 was from natural gas and 5 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda and sodium chlorate most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

our papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements 

customers 

we have about 100 customers in approximately 350 locations these customers include office products distributors and retailers paper merchants and envelope and other converters we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment effective january 1 2020 we have a revised agreement with office depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and noncommodity office papers to office depot through december 31 2022 office depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds if the agreement is not renewed by the parties office depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a twoyear period beginning on january 1 2023 in 2021 our sales revenue to office depot represented 51 of our paper segment sales revenue and 4 of our consolidated sales revenue 

competition 

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of ufs paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers in 2016 as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before united states international trade authorities antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in australia brazil china indonesia and portugal these duties remain in effect after sunset review of duty orders by the us international trade commission in january 2022 other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation and sylvamo corporation we also face competition from foreign producers although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers 

corporate and other 

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in “part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the future effect of the covid19 pandemic on our operations is uncertain since the onset of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 federal state and local authorities have taken measures to control the outbreak of covid19 in the united states where we primarily operate these measures have included travel bans and restrictions quarantines and shelter in place orders and standards affecting employers such as mask mandates vaccine mandates and testing protocols due to the importance of our products to the continued distribution of food beverage and other necessities our operating facilities have remained in operation throughout the pandemic and we have not experienced material disruptions in operations to date pca has experienced some labor shortage issues due to labor market conditions in general which has been exacerbated by the pandemic particularly the recent spread of the omicron variant in late 2021 and early 2022 we have also experienced and may experience in the future higher supply chain and transportation costs in part due to the impacts of covid19 the impact of future variants of the virus and governmental measures to control the spread of the virus including vaccine mandates or mandatory testing protocols are uncertain and may materially restrict or hinder our ability to operate our facilities due to measures we may need to take to assure the health and safety of our employees lack of available workforce disruptions in the supply of key materials and services or restrictions due to governmental actions if our operations are hindered or restricted we may not be able to serve our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the pandemic resulting from the covid19 outbreak and measures to control the outbreak have had a negative impact on certain businesses which could adversely affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations  many businesses in the united states have been required to cease or curtail operations and workers have been laid off or furloughed and have slowed down economic activity the severity and duration of the impact on the economy will depend on the future spread of the outbreak future measures by governmental authorities to control the outbreak the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts the timing and manner in which normal social and business activities are permitted to resume and the willingness of businesses and citizens to resume those activities and the effectiveness of governmental efforts to mitigate the economic effect of the outbreak all of which are highly uncertain 

we have experienced significantly lower demand for our uncoated freesheet paper products due to economic conditions office closings and school shutdowns associated with the covid19 pandemic which harmed the performance of our paper segment and was a factor in our decision to permanently convert the no 3 machine at our jackson mill to permanently produce containerboard while we have not experienced lower demand for our containerboard and corrugated packaging products to date the effect of the pandemic on economic conditions affecting our business and future demand is uncertain it is uncertain whether to what extent and for what period of time current favorable demand conditions in the packaging segment will continue with the uncertainty of economic conditions we are unable to determine the impact on our future operating and financial performance a prolonged period of lower earnings and reduced cash flow could adversely affect our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments and access capital markets 

  

risks related to our operations business and industry 

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including demand for our products industry capacity and decisions made by other producers with respect to capacity and production and other competitive conditions in our industry these factors are affected by general global and domestic economic conditions we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes of our products which may be unpredictable and volatile in addition as many of our customer contracts include price adjustment provisions based upon published index prices for containerboard or certain grades of ufs papers our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices if supply exceeds demand industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or ufs paper producer having a dominant position certain containerboard grades and commodity ufs paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal if we are unable to successfully compete we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

ufs paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition the industry is experiencing decreasing demand for existing ufs paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for ufs paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows 

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy selfsufficiency or lower operating costs compared to our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors pricing strategies changes in customer preferences and the costefficiency of our facilities 

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at six of our mills in 2021 we purchased approximately 860000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past including during 2021 as demand for domestic recycled fiber remained high prices for recycled fiber may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings a 10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately 86 million of additional expense based on 2021 consumption 

  

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we are experiencing significant cost inflation for key inputs such as fuels and chemicals we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark and other purchased fuels fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels such as natural gas which represents the majority of our purchased fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings if we are unable to recover such increases through higher prices of our products a 010 per million mmbtu increase in natural gas prices would result in approximately 3 million of additional expense based on 2021 usage 

customer concentration  we rely on certain large customers our packaging and paper segments each have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect the segment’s sales and profitability in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results 

office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment effective january 1 2020 we have a revised agreement with office depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and noncommodity office papers to office depot through december 31 2022 office depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds if the agreement is not renewed by the parties office depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a twoyear period beginning on january 1 2023 

in 2021 sales to office depot represented 51 of our paper segment sales and 4 of our consolidated sales if these sales are reduced including if we are unable to renew the agreement at historical volume levels we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial condition of office depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes office depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations 

transportation costs  reduced truck and rail availability could lead to higher costs or poorer service resulting in lower earnings and harm our ability to distribute our products we ship our products primarily by truck and rail we have experienced lower availability of thirdparty trucking services including truck and driver shortages and service issues interruptions and delays in rail services these issues became more pronounced later in 2021 and continue to persist while we have generally been able to manage through these issues and have not experienced material disruptions in our ability to serve our customers these issues have resulted in significantly higher costs for transportation services if these factors persist we could experience even higher transportation costs in the future and difficulties shipping our products in a timely manner we may not be able to recover higher transportation costs through higher prices or otherwise which would result in lower earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

• unscheduled maintenance outages 

• prolonged power failures 

• equipment or information system breakdowns or failures 

• explosion of a boiler or other major facilities 

• disruption in the supply of raw materials such as wood fiber energy or chemicals 

• a spill or release of pollutants or hazardous substances 

• closure or curtailment related to environmental concerns 

• labor difficulties 

• disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including roads bridges railroad tracks and tunnels 

• terrorism or threats of terrorism 

• other operational problems 

  

these events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

extreme weather events  our facilities are susceptible to extreme weather events which could disrupt our business extreme weather events like hurricanes tornadoes floods and winter storms have caused disruptions to our business both directly and indirectly in recent history climate change may increase the frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events certain weather events may cause damage to our facilities and require us to temporarily halt operations in 2020 hurricane laura resulted in widespread damage and power interruption at our deridder louisiana containerboard mill resulting in a multiple day outage and significant lost production and incremental costs these types of events may also disrupt our suppliers’ operations and their ability to transport materials to our facilities disruptions to the supply chain may cause the cost of goods to temporarily increase damage to our facilities may cause insurance premiums to increase and also require us to incur additional costs to mitigate future risks 

reliance on personnel  we may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel including key management personnel our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities produce our products and serve our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees changing demographics and labor work force trends may make it difficult for us to replace retiring employees at our manufacturing and other facilities us labor market conditions are tight and labor shortages have been exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic we have experienced higher than historical employee turnover in certain of our facilities these conditions are expected to persist into 2022 and may lead to higher labor costs if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience labor shortages we may experience higher costs and other difficulties and our business may be adversely impacted 

in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively as our business has grown in size and geographic scope we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex operations the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business 

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our thirdparty providers could become subject to cyberattacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines which may be significant or other adverse regulatory action because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur additional operating expenses andor significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers and other equipment in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

labor relations if we experience strikes or other work stoppages our business will be harmed our workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements we must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future while we believe that we have satisfactory labor relations we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our business results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 

  

financial risks 

general economic conditions  if business political and economic conditions change in an adverse manner our business results of operations liquidity and financial position may be harmed general global and domestic economic conditions directly affect the levels of demand and production of consumer goods levels of employment the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business if economic conditions deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower disposable income persistent inflation unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending we may experience lower demand for our products which is largely driven by demand for products of our customers which utilize our products the us economy is experiencing the highest levels of inflation in decades and we are experiencing cost inflation across our business persistent inflation will result in continued higher production and transportation costs which we may not be able to recover through higher prices charged to our customers or otherwise in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact global markets and demand for our and our customers’ products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments further changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities these conditions are beyond our control and may have a material impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position 

inflation and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services general economic conditions have resulted in higher inflation which has led to higher costs across our business if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2021 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 64 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 60 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 64 million and cash costs by 60 million 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2021 we had 25 billion of debt outstanding and a 3232 million undrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit all debt is comprised of fixedrate senior notes we and our subsidiaries are not restricted from incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation 

• result in significant cash requirements to make interest and maturity payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in our business or industry conditions 

• increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• limit our flexibility to make acquisitions 

further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all 

pension plans – our pension plans may require additional funding we record a liability associated with our pensions equal to the excess of the benefit obligations over the fair value of the assets funding the plans the actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding fluctuations in the market performance of our plan assets will affect our pension plan costs in future periods changes in assumptions regarding expected longterm rate of return on plan assets our discount rate expected compensation levels or mortality will also increase or decrease pension costs 

  

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors and other factors beyond our control this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock with little regard to our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

executive summary 

net sales were 773 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 and 666 billion in 2020 we reported 841 million of net income or 883 per diluted share in 2021 compared to 461 million or 484 per diluted share in 2020 net income included 53 million of expense for special items in 2021 compared to 89 million of expense for special items in 2020 special items in both periods are described later in this section excluding special items we recorded 894 million of net income or 939 per diluted share in 2021 compared to 550 million or 578 per diluted share in 2020 the increase was driven primarily by higher prices and mix in our packaging and paper segments and higher volumes in our packaging segment partially offset by higher operating and converting costs higher annual outage expense lower volumes in our paper segment and higher freight and logistic expense for additional detail on special items included in reported gaap results as well as segment income loss excluding special items earnings before nonoperating pension expense interest income taxes and depreciation amortization and depletion ebitda and ebitda excluding special items see “item 7 reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” pca ended the year with 765 million of cash and marketable debt securities and including borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility 11 billion in liquidity 

packaging segment income from operations was 1306 million in 2021 compared to 830 million in 2020 packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was 1688 million in 2021 compared to 1229 million in 2020 the increase was driven primarily by higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix and higher sales and production volumes partially offset by higher operating and converting costs higher annual outage expense and higher freight and logistic expenses demand for packaging segment products remained strong throughout the year with recordsetting shipments from our corrugated products and record containerboard production we also continued to experience cost inflation across our business including in the areas of labor and benefits recycled fiber energy repairs materials and supplies as well as higher transportation costs driven by higher fuel costs tight rail supply driver and truck shortages and higher spot prices we have experienced some workforce availability issues late in the year and early in 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant as well as effects from supply chain and transportation service disruptions but we have generally been able to manage through these issues such that our operations have not been materially disrupted we continue to deploy capital to improve productivity and efficiencies at our facilities and believe that our success in doing so is helping us to manage cost inflation and better serve our customers 

paper segment income from operations was 39 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 20 million in 2020 paper segment ebitda excluding special items was 72 million in 2021 compared to 73 million in 2020 the decrease was due primarily to lower sales and production volumes and higher freight and logistic expenses partially offset by lower operating costs lower annual outage expense and higher paper prices and mix as described in note 9 goodwill and intangible assets included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we incurred a charge of 552 million during 2020 associated with the full impairment of goodwill within the paper segment 

  

sales and production volumes in the paper segment significantly declined after the first quarter of 2020 as the covid19 pandemic caused lower demand for our paper products during the second and third quarters of 2020 in response to such lower demand we temporary idled both machines at our jackson alabama mill during the fourth quarter of 2020 in order to meet strong packaging demand and maintain appropriate inventory levels in the packaging segment we temporarily began producing linerboard on the no 3 machine at the mill and we have produced linerboard on the machine since that time in the first quarter of 2021 we announced the discontinuation of production of uncoated freesheet paper grades on the machine and the permanent conversion of the machine to produce linerboard and other papertocontainerboard conversion related activities demand for paper products has improved since the beginning of the pandemic but our sales and production in the paper segment will remain below prepandemic levels as we will no longer be producing paper products on the machine later in 2021 we began to produce corrugating medium on the no 1 machine at the jackson mill which had produced uncoated freesheet paper in the past to help satisfy our demand for containerboard build necessary inventories and evaluate the capability of the machine to produce containerboard on a costeffective basis we expect to continue to produce corrugating medium on the machine for the foreseeable future before october 2020 operating results for the jackson mill were included in the paper segment beginning in october 2020 operating results for the jackson mill are included in both the packaging and paper segments 

on december 10 2021 we completed the acquisition of the assets of advance packaging corporation an independent corrugated products producer for a cash purchase price of 195 million including a purchase price adjustment based upon net working capital advance packaging is a fullservice producer of corrugated packaging products including graphics retail displays sustainable shipping containers and protective packaging advance packaging owns and operates a 500000 square foot corrugated products facility in grand rapids michigan the operating results of advance packaging are included in pcas results after the date of acquisition the acquisition is consistent with our historical growth strategy and will provide additional integration of containerboard we produce into our own corrugated products facilities 

special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items 

earnings per diluted share excluding special items in 2021 and 2020 were as follows 

 

   

a for 2021 includes 36 million of income primarily consisting of an adjustment of the required asset retirement obligation related to the 2020 closure of the san lorenzo california facility a gain on sale of transportation assets and corrugated products facilities and insurance proceeds received for a natural disaster at one of the corrugated products facilities partially offset by closure costs related to corrugated products facilities for 2020 includes 281 million of restructuring costs for paper administrative functions and closure costs related to corrugated products facilities substantially all of which relates to the previously announced closure of the san lorenzo california facility during the second quarter of 2020 partially offset by income related to the sale of a corrugated products facility during the second quarter of 2020

c includes 140 million of charges related to the announced discontinuation of production of uncoated freesheet paper grades on the no 3 machine at the jackson alabama mill associated with the permanent conversion of the machine to produce linerboard and other papertocontainerboard conversion related activities 

d includes 09 million of charges for acquisition and integration costs related to the december 2021 advance packaging corporation acquisition 

  

e during the second quarter of 2020 with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions and the estimated impact on our paper reporting unit arising from the covid19 pandemic as well as projected future results of operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our paper reporting unit the company performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of may 31 2020 and based on the evaluation performed we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the paper reporting unit and recognized a noncash impairment charge of 552 million 

f includes 100 million of charges related to the impact of hurricane laura at our deridder louisiana mill including unabsorbed costs related to lost production excess purchased containerboard and freight costs repair expenses rental and supplies costs and other recovery expenses 

g includes 69 million of incremental outofpocket costs related to covid19 including supplies cleaning and sick pay beginning in july 2020 all corresponding covid19 related expenses were included in normalized costs 

  

management excludes special items as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

industry and busi ness conditions 

trade publications reported north american industrywide corrugated products shipments per workday were up 28 during 2021 compared to 2020 reported industry containerboard production increased 56 compared to 2020 and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2021 were approximately 28 million tons up 195 compared to 2020 reported containerboard export shipments increased 99 compared to 2020 prices reported by trade publications increased by 20 per ton for linerboard and 30 per ton for corrugating medium in march 2021 40 per ton for linerboard and corrugating medium in april 2021 and a further 50 per ton for linerboard and 60 per ton for corrugating medium in august 2021 

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers trade publications reported north american uncoated freesheet paper shipments were down 04 in 2021 compared to 2020 average prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers increased 20 per ton in march 2021 40 per ton in april 2021 30 per ton in june 2021 30 per ton in july 2021 and 80 per ton in november 2021 

outlook 

for the first quarter of 2022 in the packaging segment we expect higher corrugated products volume than the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by continued strong demand and three additional shipping days along with slightly higher domestic and export containerboard sale prices and mix earlier in the first quarter we notified our customers of a 70 per ton price increase for all of our linerboard and corrugating grades we do not expect to realize significant benefits of this price increase during the first quarter of 2022 

in our paper segment we expect higher prices and mix from price increases previously communicated to customers during the fourth quarter and earlier in the first quarter of 2022 

we expect maintenance outage expenses in the first quarter to be lower than the fourth quarter we also expect continued cost inflation to persist at higher than historical levels across our mills converting plants and other operations as well as freight and logistics expenses in addition to the effect of cost inflation labor and benefits costs will also be higher due to timingrelated increases such as annual wage increases and seasonally colder weather is expected to increase energy and wood fiber costs the effect of higher costs is expected to offset any sequential benefit of higher corrugated products volume and more favorable prices and mix in our packaging and paper segments considering these items and excluding the effect of any special items we expect first quarter earnings to be lower than our earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021

during 2021 nonoperating pension income increased 17 million compared to 2020 the increase in nonoperating pension expense was primarily related to the favorable 2020 asset performance partially offset by assumption changes 

  

interest expense net during 2021 increased 59 million compared to 2020 the increase is related to the 59 million of charges from the companys debt refinancing completed in october 2021 

during 2021 we recorded 268 million of income tax expense compared with 172 million of income tax expense during 2020 the effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 241 and 271 respectively the higher effective tax rate for 2020 was primarily due to the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge associated with our paper reporting unit with no corresponding charge during 2021 

liquidity and ca pital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 619 million of cash and cash equivalents 146 million of marketable debt securities and 323 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit on october 8 2021 we redeemed our 700 million of outstanding 450 notes due november 1 2023 using the proceeds of new notes we issued in september 2021 and cashonhand see note 11 debt of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k as well as the information provided below under financing activities for further information 

currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures acquisitions debt service common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions 

 

 operating activities 

our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other accrued liabilities as well as other factors described below cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

during 2021 net cash provided by operating activities was 1094 million compared to 1033 million for 2020 an increase of 61 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased 426 million primarily due to higher income from operations as discussed above cash decreased by 365 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to the following 

a an increase in accounts receivable levels in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher sales volumes and pricing in the packaging segment and higher pricing partially offset by lower sales volumes in the paper segment in 2021 

b an increase in inventories in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily related to an increase in containerboard and finished goods in the packaging segment due to the need to service stronger demand 

c an unfavorable change in accounts payable in 2021 compared to 2020 related to the timing of payments and 

d higher income tax payments in 2021 due to higher income levels in 2021 as compared to 2020 

  

these changes were partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher accruals for employee compensation and benefits liabilities as well as higher accruals for customer volume rebates in 2021 

investing activities 

we used 794 million for investing activities in 2021 compared to 426 million in 2020 in 2021 we spent 605 million for internal capital investments compared to 421 million in 2020 during 2021 we acquired advance packaging corporation for 195 million including a purchase price adjustment based upon net working capital we did not acquire any businesses in 2020 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are included in the table below dollars in millions 

  

   

we expect capital investments in 2022 to be about 800 million including capital spending related to the conversion of the no 3 paper machine to containerboard at our jackson mill these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results strategic opportunities future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about 17 million in 2022 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations for additional information see “environmental matters” in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2021 the company had commitments for capital expenditures of 785 million the company believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

in 2021 net cash used for financing activities was 656 million compared to 312 million of cash used for financing activities in 2020 an increase of 344 million we paid 380 million in dividends on our common stock in 2021 compared to 300 million paid in 2020 we repurchased and retired 14 million shares of the companys common stock for 193 million in 2021 we had no share repurchases in 2020 in 2021 we issued 700 million of 305 senior notes due 2051 the new notes through a registered public offering and notified the holders of our 700 million 450 senior notes due november 1 2023 the old notes that we would redeem those notes in october 2021 on october 8 2021 we completed the redemption of the old notes for 770 million which included a redemption premium of 56 million and 14 million of accrued and unpaid interest we used the proceeds of the offering of the new notes and cashonhand to fund the redemption and the 8 million of debt issuance costs associated with the new notes 

in addition to the 8 million of issuance costs associated with the debt refinancing we paid an additional 1 million of issuance costs related to the new revolving credit agreement that was entered into june 8 2021

offb alance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2021 

inflation and other g eneral cost increases 

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2021 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 64 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 60 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 64 million and cash costs by 60 million 

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals 

  

energy 

in 2021 our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 93 million mmbtus of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2021 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs 

 

   

in addition the mills purchased 2329 million ckwh hundred kilowatthours of electricity in 2021 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows 

 

   

regulatory and environme nt al matters 

our operations are subject to our compliance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate primarily in the united states of particular importance are laws and regulations relating to the environment and health and safety matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

• resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

• clean water act cwa 

• clean air act caa 

• the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

• toxic substance control act tsca and 

• safe drinking water act sdwa 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for both the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we spent 44 million and for 2019 we spent 41 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally we had 10 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2021 and 9 million in both 2020 and 2019 

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” established a threeyear deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pcas compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards 

  

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2021 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2021 we maintained an environmental reserve of 243 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 243 million accrued at december 31 2021 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps carbon or other taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate the majority of our power requirements at our mills using renewable biogenic fuel such as bark black liquor and biomass which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

we and our industry support the goal of a 50 reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030 from a 2005 baseline we have established a carbon neutrality team consisting of a crossfunctional group of key operational engineering technology and sustainability personnel to lead our efforts our strategy to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions is premised upon the carbon neutrality of the biogenic fuels used in our operations and we believe that meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through investment in more efficient operations utilizing carbonneutral fuels we work constantly to identify and implement highreturn projects that will improve our efficiency to what extent and when we embark upon major capital projects to reduce emissions will depend in part upon emerging regulatory and tax policy involving greenhouse gas emissions and incentives to invest in projects that reduce emissions we also regularly assess the use of alternative nonemitting energy sources at our own facilities such as solar where feasible to do so and partnering with utilities to procure carbonfree power where opportunities exist we annually report key data to our stakeholders regarding our greenhouse gas emissions among other things in our responsibility report our responsibility report is available on our website and is not intended to be incorporated by reference herein 

we are also subject to extensive federal state and local laws related to workplace health and safety and our safety management system includes measures to assure compliance with these laws and regulations we do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

critical accounting po licies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

pensions 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits  the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 13 employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2021 we had approximately 748 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs net of tax recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans which is between six and nine years and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of boise plans which is between 22 and 26 years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 

 

   

a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2021 and 2022 pension expense dollars in millions 

 

   

a the sensitivities shown above are specific to 2021 and 2022 the sensitivities may not be additive so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 

for more information related to our pension benefit plans see note 13 employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

  

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2021 we had 9235 million of goodwill all of which was recorded in the packaging segment of the 9235 million of goodwill 600 million was recorded in connection with the acquisition of advance packaging the amount of goodwill associated with the advance packaging acquisition continues to be preliminary as estimates and assumptions are subject to change as more information becomes available 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

during the second quarter of 2020 with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our paper reporting unit and performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of may 31 2020 for additional information see note 9 goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

based on the evaluation performed we determined that the carrying value of the paper reporting unit exceeded its fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling 552 million the full amount of goodwill associated with the paper reporting unit at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 0 million of goodwill recorded in the paper segment 

under asu 201704 topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  companies are no longer required to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment thus eliminating step two of the analysis that was required under the prior guidance under asu 201704 goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company adopted this asu prospectively beginning with its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017 

the update to the standard does not eliminate the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that is often used to determine if the quantitative assessment is necessary the qualitative assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance as well as company and reporting unit specific items if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value then no further testing is required otherwise the company would perform a quantitative analysis 

the quantitative analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values in calculating fair value we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows level 3 measurement these estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience business expectations and the economic environment if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through an impairment charge 

during the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2021 we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the packaging reporting unit was less than its carrying value based on the results of the qualitative impairment test we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the packaging reporting unit 

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

  

longlived asset impairment 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period 

during the second quarter of 2020 with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of our long lived assets within our paper segment including property plant and equipment and performed a recoverability test on the paper reporting unit long lived assets as of may 31 2020 the recoverability test was based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows the results of the recoverability test indicated that the long lived assets within our paper segment inclusive of property plant and equipment were 100 recoverable 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates in 2021 and 2020 we recognized incremental depreciation expense of 47 million and 45 million respectively the incremental depreciation expense for 2021 related to jackson mill conversionrelated activities and closures of corrugated products facilities while the incremental depreciation expense for 2020 related to closures of corrugated products facilities

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on december 10 2021 pca acquired advance packaging corporation advance packaging we are currently in the process of evaluating and integrating advance packagings controls over financial reporting which may result in changes or additions to pcas internal control over financial reporting under guidelines established by the sec companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company we excluded advance packaging from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2021 except as may relate to the advance packaging acquisition there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended december 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 advance packaging accounted for approximately 3 of the companys consolidated total assets and less than 1 of consolidated net sales

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs each of our plants serve a market radius of approximately 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2020 our usage of recycled fiber net of internal generation represents 17 of our containerboard production 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc ®  and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

 

energy supply   energy at our packaging mills is obtained through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas purchased wood waste and other purchased fuels each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2020 our packaging mills consumed about 74 million mmbtus of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 74 million mmbtus consumed about 63 was from mill generated byproducts and 37 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 78 was from natural gas 20 was from purchased wood waste and 2 was from other purchased fuels

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard including caustic soda sulfuric acid soda ash and lime most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters

our containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products

customers

we sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 16000 customers in approximately 33000 locations about 70 of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2019 fibre box association annual report

 



 

competition

as of december 31 2020 we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 450 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence

 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company westrock company georgiapacific llc and pratt industries however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller local producers 

paper

we are the third largest manufacturer of ufs in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content our papers consist of communication papers including cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers 

facilities

we currently have two paper mills located in the united states total annual ufs capacity is 964000 tons our operations include the following

jackson our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

international falls our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment we consume wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp our jackson mill purchases recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchase and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc ®  and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

energy supply we obtain energy through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas electricity and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity 

in 2020 our paper mills consumed about 19 million mmbtus of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 19 million mmbtus consumed about 75 was from mill generated byproducts and 25 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 89 was from natural gas and 11 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda and sodium chlorate most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements

customers

we have over 100 customers in approximately 400 locations these customers include office products distributors and retailers paper merchants and envelope and other converters we have established longterm relationships with many of our 

 

customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment effective january 1 2020 we have a revised agreement with office depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and noncommodity office papers to office depot through december 31 2022 office depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds if the agreement is not renewed by the parties office depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a twoyear period beginning on january 1 2023 in 2020  our sales revenu e to office depot represented 45  of our paper segment sales revenue and 5  of our consolidated sales revenue  

competition

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of ufs paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers in 2016 as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before united states international trade authorities antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in australia brazil china indonesia and portugal these duties remain in effect and are subject to review in 2021 other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation and international paper company we also face competition from foreign producers although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers

corporate and other

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in “part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or in our other filings with the 

 

securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic

the future effect of the covid19 pandemic on our operations is uncertain on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak a pandemic since that time federal state and local authorities have taken measures to control the outbreak of covid19 in the united states where we primarily operate these measures have included travel bans and restrictions quarantines and shelter in place orders due to the importance of our products to the continued distribution of food beverage and other necessities our operating facilities have been permitted to remain in operation and we have not experienced material disruptions in operations to date despite the spread of the virus in the united states we have maintained sufficient workforce availability as well as adequate supply of raw materials and necessary services to continue operating without material disruption however the impact of the further spread of the virus and the measures to control the spread of the virus are uncertain and may materially restrict or hinder our ability to operate our facilities due to measures we may need to take to assure the health and safety of our employees lack of available workforce disruptions in the supply of key materials and services or restrictions due to governmental actions we cannot assure you as to the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts on the control of spread of the virus if our operations are hindered or restricted we may not be able to serve our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the pandemic resulting from the covid19 outbreak and measures to control the outbreak are having a negative impact on domestic economic activity which could adversely affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations  many businesses in the united states have been required to cease or curtail operations and workers have been laid off or furloughed and have slowed down economic activity the severity and duration of the impact on the economy will depend on the future spread of the outbreak future measures by governmental authorities to control the outbreak the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts the timing and manner in which normal social and business activities are permitted to resume and the effectiveness of governmental efforts to mitigate the economic effect of the outbreak all of which are highly uncertain 

we have experienced significantly lower demand for our uncoated freesheet paper products due to economic conditions office closings and school shutdowns associated with the covid19 pandemic which harmed the performance of our paper segment our jackson alabama mill was idled for the majority of the second and third quarters of 2020 and began to produce containerboard for the packaging segment on a trial basis during the fourth quarter while we have not experienced lower demand for our containerboard and corrugated packaging products to date the effect of the pandemic on economic conditions affecting our business and future demand is uncertain i t is uncertain whether to what extent and for what period of time current favorable demand conditions in the packaging segment will continue with the uncertainty of economic conditions we are unable to determine the impact on our future operating and financial performance a prolonged period of lower earnings and reduced cash flow could adversely affect our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments and access capital markets 

risks related to our operations business and industry

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including demand for our products industry capacity and decisions made by other producers with respect to capacity and production and other competitive conditions in our industry these factors are affected by general global and domestic economic conditions we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes of our products which may be unpredictable and volatile in addition as many of our customer contracts include price adjustment provisions based upon published index prices for containerboard or certain grades of ufs papers our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices if supply exceeds demand industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or ufs paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity ufs paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation 

 

design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal if we are unable to successfully compete we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

ufs paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition the industry is experiencing decreasing demand for existing ufs paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for ufs paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy selfsufficiency or lower operating costs compared to our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors pricing strategies changes in customer preferences and the costefficiency of our facilities

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at five of our six containerboard mills and both paper mills in 2020 we purchased approximately 725000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past including during 2020 as demand for domestic recycled fiber from chinese producers continued to remain low prices for recycled fiber may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings a 10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately 7 million of additional expense based on 2020 consumption

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark and other purchased fuels fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels particularly coal and fossil fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings if we are unable to recover such increases through higher prices of our products a 010 per million mmbtu increase in natural gas prices would result in approximately 3 million of additional expense based on 2020 usage 

customer concentration  we rely on certain large customers our packaging and paper segments each have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect the segment’s sales and profitability in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results 

office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment effective january 1 2020 we have a revised agreement with office depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and noncommodity office papers to office depot through december 31 2022 office depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds if the agreement is not renewed by the parties office depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a twoyear period beginning on january 1 2023

 

in 2020  sale s to office depot represented 45 of our paper segment sales and 5 of our consolidated sales if t hese sales are reduced including if we are unable to renew the agreement at historical volume levels we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial condition of office depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes office depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations 

transportation costs  reduced truck and rail availability could lead to higher costs or poorer service resulting in lower earnings and harm our ability to distribute our products we ship our products primarily by truck and rail we have experienced lower availability of thirdparty trucking services and service issues interruptions and delays in rail services we have also experienced higher costs for transportation services in general if these factors persist we could experience even higher transportation costs in the future and difficulties shipping our products in a timely manner we may not be able to recover higher transportation costs through higher prices or otherwise which would result in lower earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

























these events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings

reliance on personnel  we may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel including key management personnel our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities produce our products and serve our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees changing demographics and labor work force trends may make it difficult for us to replace retiring employees at our manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience labor shortages we may experience higher costs and other difficulties and our business may be adversely impacted 

in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively as our business has grown in size and geographic scope we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex operations the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyberattacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational 

 

disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines which may be significant or other adverse regulatory action because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur additional operating expenses andor significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers and other equipment in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

labor relations if we experience strikes or other work stoppages our business will be harmed our workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements we must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future while we believe that we have satisfactory labor relations we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our business results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 

financial risks

general economic conditions  if business political and economic conditions change in an adverse manner our business results of operations liquidity and financial position may be harmed general global and domestic economic conditions directly affect the levels of demand and production of consumer goods levels of employment the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business if economic conditions deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower disposable income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending we may experience lower demand for our products which is largely driven by demand for products of our customers which utilize our products if economic conditions result in higher inflation we may experience higher production and transportation costs which we may not be able to recover through higher prices or otherwise in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact global markets and demand for our and our customers’ products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments further changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities these conditions are beyond our control and may have a material impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position 

inflation and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services general economic conditions may result in higher inflation which may increase our exposure to higher costs if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2020 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 58 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 54 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 58 million and cash costs by 54 million

 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2020 we had 25 billion of debt outstanding and a 3263 million u ndrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit all debt is comprised of fixedrate senior notes we and our subsidiaries are not restricted from incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation













further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all

pension plans – our pension plans may require additional funding we record a liability associated with our pensions equal to the excess of the benefit obligations over the fair value of the assets funding the plans the actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding fluctuations in the market performance of our plan assets will affect our pension plan costs in future periods changes in assumptions regarding expected longterm rate of return on plan assets our discount rate expected compensation levels or mortality will also increase or decrease pension costs 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors and other factors beyond our control this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock with little regard to our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

executive summary

net sales were 666 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 and 696 billion in 2019 we reported 461 million of net income or 484 per diluted share in 2020 compared to 696 million or 734 per diluted share in 2019 net income included 89 million of expense for special items in 2020 compared to 29 million of expense for special items in 2019 special items in both periods are described later in this section excluding special items we recorded 550 million of net income or 578 per diluted share in 2020 compared to 726 million or 765 per diluted share in 2019 the decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging and paper segments lower volumes in our paper segment higher freight and logistic expense and higher annual outage expense partially offset by higher volumes in our packaging segment and lower operating and converting costs for additional detail on special items included in reported gaap results as well as segment income loss excluding special items earnings before nonoperating pension expense interest income taxes and depreciation amortization and depletion ebitda and ebitda excluding special items see “item 7 reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” pca ended the year with 11 billion of cash and marketable debt securities and including borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility 14 billion in liquidity

the company was committed to conducting safe operations through the covid19 pandemic during the year in adherence with the guidelines of the center for disease control and applicable health and safety regulations as pca’s operations continued to operate as “essential businesses” we adopted measures to protect the health and safety of our employees including social distancing practices enhanced sanitation procedures and modified absence pay policies these practices will continue into 2021 as the effects of the pandemic continue pca did not experience significant disruptions in its operations as a result of the pandemic and has maintained adequate availability of its workforce and supply of raw materials and services to continue to serve its customers

packaging segment income from operations was 830 million in 2020 compared to 963 million in 2019 packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was 1229 million in 2020 compared to 1310 million in 2019 the decrease was driven primarily by lower containerboard and corrugated prices and mix partially offset by higher sales and production volumes lower operating and converting costs lower annual outage expense and lower freight and logistic expenses demand for packaging segment products remained strong throughout the year with our corrugated products shipments up 58 over 2019 an increase of 54 on a per day basis as 2020 had one more operating day than 2019 and is expected to remain strong into the first quarter of 2021 we notified our customers of increased prices on our containerboard and corrugated products 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2020  we expect to incur some inflation in freight labor energy and fiber costs into the first quarter of 2021 

paper segment loss from operations was 20 million in 2020 compared to income of 175 million in 2019 paper segment ebitda excluding special items was 73 million in 2020 compared to 213 million in 2019 the decrease was due primarily to lower sales and production volumes lower paper prices and mix higher annual outage expense and higher freight and logistic expenses partially offset by lower operating costs sales were 30 lower than last year as demand for our paper products has continued to be negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic due to office and school closures as described in note 8 goodwill and intangible assets included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we incurred a charge of 552 million during the year associated with the full impairment of goodwill within the paper segment

operations at our jackson alabama mill were idled for the majority of the second and third quarters of 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2020 due to an increase in demand for our corrugated products and as part of our assessment of a potential conversion to produce containerboard we began producing highperformance virgin kraft linerboard on the no 3 machine at our jackson mill before october 2020 operating results for the jackson mill were included in the paper segment beginning in october 2020 operating results for the jackson mill are included in both the packaging and paper segments we expect to continue to produce containerboard on the jackson machine during the first quarter of 2021 to fulfill the needs of our packaging customers as well as produce uncoated freesheet to service our paper customers

during the second quarter of 2018 the company discontinued production of paper grades at its wallula washington mill and converted the no 3 paper machine to a virgin kraft linerboard machine the company incurred charges in the packaging and paper segments relating to these activities during 2019 as described below under “special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items” 

special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items

earnings per diluted share excluding special items in 2020 and 2019 were as follows

 



 









 









 

management excludes special items as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such

packaging net sales decreased 13 million or 02 to 5919 million compared to 5932 million in 2019 due to lower prices and mix 298 million partially offset by increased volumes 285 million primarily due to strong corrugated products demand and shipments in 2020 our domestic containerboard prices decreased 59 and export prices decreased 115 compared to 2019 our containerboard outside shipments decreased 58 and total corrugated products shipments were up 58 in total and 54 per workday compared to 2019 prices reported by trade publications which serve as an index for prices for our corrugated products in many of our customer contracts decreased by 10 per ton for linerboard and 15 per ton for corrugating medium in january followed by a 50 per ton increase in linerboard and medium in november 2020 

paper net sales decreased 289 million or 300 to 675 million compared to 964 million in 2019 the decrease was due to lower volume 262 million and prices and mix 27 million as demand was harmed by the covid19 pandemic due to office and school closures 

gross profit

gross profit decreased 275 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging and paper segments lower volumes in our paper segment higher freight and logistic expense and higher annual outage expense partially offset by higher volumes in our packaging segment and lower operating and converting costs in 2020 gross profit included 21 million of special item expense related to the impact of hurricane laura at our deridder louisiana mill incremental outofpocket costs related to covid19 and facility closure costs compared to no significant special items in 2019 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased 18 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expenses and lower administrative and other corporate costs partially offset by higher employee salaries and fringes 

goodwill impairment

during 2020 with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions and the estimated impact on our paper reporting unit arising from the covid19 pandemic as well as projected future results of operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our paper reporting unit the company performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of may 31 2020 and based on the evaluation performed we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the paper reporting unit and recognized a noncash impairment charge of 55 million for more information see note 8 goodwill and intangible assets of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements” of this form 10k

nonoperating pension expense interest expense net and income taxes 

during 2020 nonoperating pension expense decreased 10 million compared to 2019 the decrease in nonoperating pension expense was primarily related to the favorable 2019 asset performance partially offset by assumption changes

interest expense net during 2020 decreased 35 million compared to 2019 the decrease is primarily related to higher interest expense during 2019 as a result of the company’s november 2019 debt refinancing partially offset by lower interest income due to lower rates on invested cash balances in 2020 

during 2020 we recorded 172 million of income tax expense compared with 221 million of income tax expense during 2019 the effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 271 and 241 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources

sources and uses of cash

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 975 million of cash and cash equivalents 148 million of marketable debt securities and 326 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures acquisitions debt service common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions

 



operating activities

our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other accrued liabilities as well as other factors described below cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

during 2020 net cash provided by operating activities was 1033 million compared to 1207 million for 2019 a decrease of 174 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased 243 million primarily due to lower income from operations as discussed above as well as higher pension contributions made in 2020 compared to 2019 of 25 million cash increased by 69 million due to favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to the following 





these favorable changes were partially offset by the following 



 

investing activities 

we used 426 million for investing activities in 2020 compared to 547 million in 2019 in 2020 we spent 421 million for internal capital investments compared to 400 million in 2019 during both 2020 and 2019 we did not acquire any businesses in 2020 we used 3 million of cashonhand to purchase availableforsale afs marketable debt securities net of redemptions compared to 146 million in 2019

we expect capital investments in 2021 to be between 500 million and 525 million excluding capital spending related to the potential conversion of the no 3 paper machine to containerboard at our jackson mill these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results strategic opportunities future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about 20 million in 2021 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations for additional information see “environmental matters” in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

at december 31 2020 the company had commitments for capital expenditures of 3042 million the company believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments

financing activities

in 2020 net cash used for financing activities was 312 million compared to 343 million of cash used for financing activities in 2019 a decrease of 31 million we paid 300 million in dividends on our common stock in 2020 compared to 299 million paid in 2019 in 2019 we refinanced 900 million principal amount of our long term debt payments to redeem our old debt including redemption premiums exceeded the proceeds received from issuing the new debt by 27 million we also paid 8 million of debt issuance costs see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on the debt refinancing

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2020

inflation and other general cost increases 

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity

in 2020 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 58 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 54 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 58 million and cash costs by 54 million

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals

energy

in 2020 our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 93 million mmbtus of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2020 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs

 



 

in addition the mills purchased 2264 million ckwh hundred kilowatthours of electricity in 2020 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows

 



 

 

regulatory and environme nt al matters 

our operations are subject to our compliance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate primarily in the united states of particular importance are laws and regulations relating to the environment and health and safety matters

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are













we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we spent 44 million 41 million and 40 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally we had 9 million of environmental capital expenditures in both 2020 and 2019 and 7 million in 2018

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” established a threeyear deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pcas compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2020 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2020 we maintained an environmental reserve of 236 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 236 million accrued at december 31 2020 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate the majority o f our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

we are also subject to extensive federal state and local laws related to workplace health and safety and our safety management system includes measures to assure compliance with these laws and regulations we do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity

pensions

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits  the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 12 employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2020 we had approximately 1442 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs net of tax recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans which is between seven and nine years and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of boise plans which is between 23 and 26 years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense

 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 

 



 

a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2020 and 2021 pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill impairment

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2020 we had 8635 million of goodwill all of which was recorded in the packaging segment

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

during the second quarter of 2020 with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our paper reporting unit and performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of may 31 2020 for additional information see note 8 goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k

based on the evaluation performed we determined that the carrying value of the paper reporting unit exceeded its fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling 552 million the full amount of goodwill associated with the paper reporting unit at december 31 2020 we had 0 million of goodwill recorded in the paper segment 

under asu 201704 topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  companies are no longer required to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment thus eliminating step two of the analysis that was required under the prior guidance under asu 201704 goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and 

 

recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company adopted this asu prospectively beginning with its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017 

the update to the standard does not eliminate the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that is often used to determine if the quantitative assessment is necessary the qualitative assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance as well as company and reporting unit specific items if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value then no further testing is required otherwise the company would perform a quantitative analysis 

the quantitative analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values in calculating fair value we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows level 3 measurement these estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience business expectations and the economic environment if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through an impairment charge

during the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the packaging reporting unit was less than its carrying value based on the results of the qualitative impairment test we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the packaging reporting unit

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates

longlived asset impairment

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period

during the second quarter of 2020 with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of our long lived assets within our paper segment including property plant and equipment and performed a recoverability test on the paper reporting unit long lived assets as of may 31 2020 the recoverability test was based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows the results of the recoverability test indicated that the long lived assets within our paper segment inclusive of property plant and equipment were 100 recoverable

we review the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement

 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates in 2020 and 2019  we recognized incremental depreciation expense of  45 million and 03 million respectively  the incremental depreciation expense for 2020 related to closures of corrugated products facilities while the incremental depreciation expense for 2019 primarily related to the second quarter 2018 discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated oneside white paper grades at the wallula washington mill associated with the conversion of the no 3 paper machine to produce virgin kraft linerboard

controls and procedures

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2020 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2020 

during the quarter ended december 31 2020 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 based on the specified criteria

packaging corporation of america “we” “us” “our” “pca” or the “company” is the third largest producer of containerboard products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet ufs paper in north america we operate six containerboard mills two uncoated freesheet ufs paper mills and 95 corrugated products manufacturing plants we are headquartered in lake forest illinois and operate primarily in the united states 

we report in three reportable segments packaging paper and corporate and other for segment financial information see note 20 segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k

during the second quarter of 2018 we discontinued the production of paper grades at the wallula washington mill and converted the no 3 machine to production of virgin kraft linerboard before may 2018 operating results for the wallula mill were included in the paper segment after may 2018 operating results for the wallula mill are primarily included in the packaging segment 

production and shipments

the following table summarizes the packaging segments containerboard production and corrugated products shipments and the paper segments ufs production

 



 



 

below is a map of our locations 

 

 

packaging

packaging products

our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium which are primarily used in the production of corrugated products our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations and honeycomb protective packaging in addition we are a large producer of packaging for meat fresh fruit and vegetables processed food beverages and other industrial and consumer products

during the year ended december 31 2019 our packaging segment produced 42 million tons of containerboard at our mills our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold 594 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 59 billion in 2019 

 

 

facilities 

we currently manufacture containerboard which includes a variety of performance and specialty grades at six containerboard mills total annual containerboard capacity was approximately 43 million tons as of december 31 2019 we also produce corrugated and protective packaging products at 95 manufacturing locations the following provides more details of our operations

counce our counce tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard on two machines the mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb 

deridder our deridder louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard on its no 1 machine and kraft linerboard and corrugating medium on its no 2 machine the mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb to 69 lb and medium in basis weights of 23 lb to 33 lb 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill produces kraft linerboard on one machine the mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill produces corrugating medium on two machines the mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb 

filer city our filer city michigan mill produces corrugating medium on three machines the mill can produce basis weights from 20 lb to 47 lb 

wallula our wallula washington mill produces corrugating medium on its no 2 machine and kraft linerboard on its no 3 machine the mill can produce medium in basis weights from 23 lb to 33 lb and linerboard in basis weights from 31 lb to 52 lb 

we operate 95 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations a technical and development center 11 regional design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 95 manufacturing facilities 62 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products 32 are sheet plants which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products and one is a corrugated sheetonly manufacturer

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs each of our plants serve a market radius of approximately 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2019 our usage of recycled fiber net of internal generation represents 17 of our containerboard production 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi ®  the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc ®  and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas purchased wood waste and other purchased fuels each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2019 our packaging mills consumed about 75 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 75 million mmbtu’s consumed about 62 was from mill generated byproducts and 38 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 72 was from natural gas 25 was from purchased wood waste and 3 was from other purchased fuels

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard including caustic soda sulfuric acid soda ash and lime most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters

our containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products

customers

we sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 17000 customers in approximately 35000 locations about 70 of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2018 fibre box association annual report

as of december 31 2019 we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 460 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence

 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company westrock company georgiapacific llc and pratt industries however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent producers 

paper

we are the third largest manufacturer of ufs in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content our papers consist of communication papers including cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers 

facilities

we currently have two paper mills located in the united states total annual ufs capacity is 964000 tons our operations include the following

jackson our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

international falls our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment we consume wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp our jackson mill purchases recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchase and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi ®  the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc ®  and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

energy supply we obtain energy through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas electricity and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity 

in 2019 our paper mills consumed about 22 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 22 million mmbtu’s consumed about 68 was from mill generated byproducts and 32 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 91 was from natural gas and 9 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda and sodium chlorate most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements

customers

we have over 100 customers in approximately 400 locations these customers include office products distributors and retailers paper merchants and envelope and other converters we have established longterm relationships with many of our 

 

customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment effective january 1 2020 we have a revised agreement with office depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and noncommodity office papers to office depot through december 31 2022 office depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds if the agreement is not renewed by the parties office depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a twoyear period beginning on january 1 2023 in 2019  our sales revenu e to office depot represented 50  of our paper segment sales revenue and 7 of our consolidated sales revenue  

competition

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of ufs paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers in 2016 as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before united states international trade authorities antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in australia brazil china indonesia and portugal these duties remain in effect other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation and international paper company we also face competition from foreign producers although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers

corporate and other

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp

employees

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 15500 employees including 4500 salaried and 11000 hourly employees approximately 63 of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt the international association of machinists iam and the association of western pulp and paper workers awppw we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future during 2019 we experienced no work stoppages and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees

risk factors 

tableend

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in “part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including demand for our products industry capacity and decisions made by other producers with respect to capacity and other competitive conditions in our industry these factors are affected by general global and domestic economic conditions we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes of our products which may be unpredictable and volatile in addition as many of our customer contracts include price adjustment provisions based upon published index prices for containerboard or certain grades of ufs papers our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices if supply exceeds demand industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed 

general economic conditions  if business political and economic conditions change in an adverse manner our business results of operations liquidity and financial position may be harmed general global and domestic economic conditions directly affect the levels of demand and production of consumer goods levels of employment the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business if economic conditions deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower disposable income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending we may experience lower demand for our products which is largely driven by demand for products of our customers which utilize our products if economic conditions result in higher inflation we may experience higher production and transportation costs which we may not be able to recover through higher prices or otherwise in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact global markets and demand for our and our customers’ products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments further changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities these conditions are beyond our control and may have a material impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or ufs paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity ufs paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal if we are unable to successfully compete we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

ufs paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition the industry is experiencing decreasing demand for existing ufs paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for ufs paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy selfsufficiency or lower operating costs compared to our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors pricing strategies changes in customer preferences and the costefficiency of our facilities

inflation and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services general economic conditions may result in higher inflation which may increase our exposure to higher costs if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2019 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 59 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 54 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 59 million and cash costs by 54 million

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at five of our six containerboard mills and both paper mills in 2019 we purchased approximately 790000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past including during 2019 as demand for domestic recycled fiber from chinese producers continued to remain low prices for recycled fiber may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings a 10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately 7 million of additional expense based on 2019 consumption

 

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark and other purchased fuels fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels particularly coal and fossil fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings if we are unable to recover such increases through higher prices of our products a 010 per million mmbtu increase in natural gas prices would result in approximately  3 million of additional expense based on 2019 usage  

transportation costs  reduced truck and rail availability could lead to higher costs or poorer service resulting in lower earnings and harm our ability to distribute our products we ship our products primarily by truck and rail we have experienced lower availability of thirdparty trucking services and service issues interruptions and delays in rail services we have also experienced higher costs for transportation services in general if these factors persist we could experience even higher transportation costs in the future and difficulties shipping our products in a timely manner we may not be able to recover higher transportation costs through higher prices or otherwise which would result in lower earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

























these events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines which may be significant or other adverse regulatory action because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur additional operating expenses andor significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers and other equipment in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

 

mergers and acquisitions  our acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations and we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses into our own we have completed several mergers and acquisitions and investments in recent years our success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate and receive the intended benefits from these acquisitions there may be difficulties costs and delays involved in the integration of these businesses into ours integration requires modification of operational and financial systems and may result in significant additional expenses if the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations or if we fail to successfully integrate these businesses our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

customer concentration  we rely on certain large customers our packaging and paper segments each have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect the segment’s sales and profitability in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results 

office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment effective january 1 2020 we have a revised agreement with office depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and noncommodity office papers to office depot through december 31 2022 office depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds if the agreement is not renewed by the parties office depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a twoyear period beginning on january 1 2023

in 2019 sales to office depot represented 50 of our paper segment sales and 7 of our consolidated sales if these sales are reduced including if we are unable to renew the agreement at historical volume levels we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial condition of office depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes office depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations

labor relations if we experience strikes or other work stoppages our business will be harmed our workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements we must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future while we believe that we have satisfactory labor relations we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our business results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 

reliance on personnel  we may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel including key management personnel our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities produce our products and serve our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees changing demographics and labor work force trends may make it difficult for us to replace retiring employees at our manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience labor shortages we may experience higher costs and other difficulties and our business may be adversely impacted 

in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively as our business has grown in size and geographic scope we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex operations the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyberattacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2019 we had 25 billion of debt outstanding and a 3292 million u ndrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit all debt is comprised of fixedrate senior notes we and our subsidiaries are not restricted from incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation













further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all

pension plans – our pension plans may require additional funding we record a liability associated with our pensions equal to the excess of the benefit obligations over the fair value of the assets funding the plans the actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding fluctuations in the market performance of our plan assets will affect our pension plan costs in future periods changes in assumptions regarding expected longterm rate of return on plan assets our discount rate expected compensation levels or mortality will also increase or decrease pension costs 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors and other factors beyond our control this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock with little regard to our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

executive summary

net sales were 696 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 and 701 billion in 2018 we reported 696 million of net income or 734 per diluted share in 2019 compared to 738 million or 780 per diluted share in 2018 net income included 29 million of expense for special items in 2019 compared to 22 million of expense for special items in 2018 special items in both periods are described later in this section excluding special items we recorded 726 million of net income or 765 per diluted share in 2019 compared to 760 million or 803 per diluted share in 2018 the decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment lower volumes in our paper segment and higher operating and converting costs partially offset by higher volumes in our packaging segment higher prices and mix in our paper segment lower annual outage expense and lower freight and logistic expenses for additional detail on special items included in reported gaap results as well as segment income loss excluding special items earnings before nonoperating pension expense interest income taxes and depreciation amortization and depletion ebitda and ebitda excluding special items see “item 7 reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” 

packaging segment income from operations was 963 million in 2019 compared to 1045 million in 2018 packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was 1310 million in 2019 compared to 1401 million in 2018 the decrease was driven primarily by lower domestic and export containerboard prices and mix and higher operating and converting costs partially offset by higher sales and production volumes higher corrugated products prices and mix lower annual outage expense and lower freight and logistic expenses 

paper segment income from operations was 175 million in 2019 compared to 98 million in 2018 paper segment ebitda excluding special items was 213 million in 2019 compared to 165 million in 2018 the increase was due primarily to higher paper prices and mix lower operating costs and lower freight and logistic expenses partially offset by lower sales and production volumes and higher annual outage expense

during the second quarter of 2018 the company discontinued production of paper grades at its wallula washington mill and converted the no 3 paper machine to a 400000 tonperyear virgin kraft linerboard machine the company incurred charges in the packaging and paper segments relating to these activities during 2019 and 2018 as described below under “special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items” 

 

special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items 

earnings per diluted share excluding special items in 2019 and 2018 were as follows

 



 











 

management excludes special items as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such

industry and business conditions

trade publications reported north american industrywide corrugated products total shipments were flat during 2019 compared to 2018 reported industry containerboard production decreased 37 compared to 2018 and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2019 were approximately 25 million tons down 51 compared to 2018 reported containerboard export shipments decreased 131 compared to 2018 prices reported by trade publications decreased by 10 per ton for linerboard in march may and june 2019 and corrugating medium decreased 20 per ton in january and 10 per ton in may and june 2019 additionally prices decreased by 10 per ton for linerboard and 15 per ton for corrugating medium in january 2020

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers trade publications reported north american uncoated freesheet paper shipments were down 109 in 2019 compared to 2018 average copy paper prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers increased 3 per ton in the first quarter and 

 

35 per ton in the second quarter followed by a decrease of 35 per ton in the third quarter and 13 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2019  

outlook

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020 in our packaging segment we expect lower prices as the remaining impact of the published domestic containerboard price decreases from 2019 are fully realized as well as the negative impact from the decreases in the published index prices for kraft linerboard and medium reported in january 2020 we also expect export prices to continue to decline containerboard volumes will be lower due to scheduled maintenance outages at our three largest mills during the quarter but we do expect higher corrugated products shipments driven by higher demand in our paper segment volumes are expected to be lower partly due to timing as we shipped higher than expected volumes during the fourth quarter as well as the scheduled outage we have at our jackson mill expenses relating to our scheduled maintenance outage activities will be significantly higher with four outages scheduled in the first quarter versus one in the fourth quarter of 2019 freight costs will be higher due to rail rate increases in certain areas and scheduled outagerelated increases labor and benefits costs will be higher with annual wage increases and other timingrelated expenses we also expect input cost inflation with purchased electricity and most of our chemical and repair and materials costs while seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs we also expect our tax rate and depreciation expense to be slightly higher considering these items we expect first quarter earnings to be lower than fourth quarter 2019

packaging net sales decreased 7 million or 01 to 5932 million compared to 5939 million in 2018 due to lower prices and mix 31 million primarily for domestic and export containerboard partially offset by increased volumes 24 million primarily due to corrugated products in 2019 our domestic containerboard prices decreased 36 and export prices decreased 205 compared to 2018 containerboard outside shipments decreased 122 and total corrugated products shipments were up 09 in total and per day workday compared to 2018 prices reported by trade publications decreased by 

 

10 per ton for linerboard in march may and june 2019 and corrugating medium decreased 20 per ton in january and  10 per ton in may and june 2019 which drove lower selling prices for containerboard and corrugated products 

paper net sales decreased 38 million or 38 to 964 million compared to 1002 million in 2018 the decrease was due to lower volume 97 million partially offset by higher prices and mix 59 million 

gross profit

gross profit decreased 1 million in 2019 compared to 2018 the decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment lower volumes in our paper segment and higher operating and converting costs partially offset by higher volumes in our packaging segment higher prices and mix in our paper segment lower annual outage expense and lower freight and logistic expenses in 2019 gross profit included no significant special items compared to 15 million related to the conversion of the no 3 machine at the wallula mill in 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased 21 million in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher employee salaries and fringes 20 million

we discuss these items in more detail in note 7 other expense income net of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements” of this form 10k

income from operations

income from operations decreased 14 million or 13 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 income from operations in 2019 included 4 million of expense for special items compared to 32 million in 2018 special items in 2019 consisted of 3 million of charges for the disposal of fixed assets related to the containerboard mill conversion at our deridder louisiana mill and 1 million of charges related to the conversion of the wallula washington mill no 3 paper machine 2018 special items included 30 million of charges related to the conversion of the wallula no 3 paper machine and 2 million related to facilities closures and other costs 

packaging segment income from operations decreased 82 million to 963 million compared to 1045 million in 2018 the decrease in 2019 related primarily to higher operating and converting costs 101 million lower domestic and export containerboard prices and mix 63 million and other fixed costs 26 million partially offset by higher containerboard and corrugated products sales and production volumes 69 million lower annual outage expense 24 million and higher corrugated products prices and mix 4 million special items in 2019 included expense of 3 million for the disposal of fixed assets related to the containerboard mill conversion at our deridder louisiana mill and 1 million of charges related to the conversion of the wallula no 3 paper machine special items in 2018 included 12 million of charges related to the conversion of the wallula no 3 paper machine and 2 million related to facilities closures and other costs

special items in the paper segment in 2019  compared to 18 million in 2018 related to the conversion of the wallula no3 paper machine to virgin kraft linerboard  

nonoperating pension expense interest expense net and income taxes

during 2019 nonoperating pension expense increased 6 million compared to 2018 the increase in nonoperating pension expense was primarily related to the 2018 asset performance ie lower asset balances resulted in lower than expected return and the amortization of the 2018 losses

interest expense net during 2019 increased 34 million compared to 2018 the increase is primarily related to the 38 million of charges from the company’s november 2019 debt refinancing partially offset by higher interest income as a result of higher cash balances in 2019 and lower interest as the company repaid 150 million of notes in march 2018 

during 2019 we recorded 221 million of income tax expense compared with 232 million of income tax expense during 2018 the effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 was 241 and 240 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources

sources and uses of cash

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 680 million of cash and cash equivalents 146 million of marketable debt securities and 329 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures acquisitions debt service common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions

 



operating activities

our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other accrued liabilities as well as other factors described below cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

during 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 1207 million compared to 1180 million for 2018 an increase of 27 million cash increased by 62 million due to favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to the following 





 

these favorable changes were partially offset by the following 





cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased 35 million primarily due to lower income from operations as discussed above as well as higher pension contributions made in 2019 compared to 2018 of 36 million partially offset by a higher deferred tax provision in 2019 compared to 2018

investing activities

we used 547 million for investing activities in 2019 compared to 608 million in 2018 in 2019 we spent 400 million for internal capital investments compared to 552 million in 2018 during 2019 we did not acquire any businesses compared to 56 million for acquisitions in 2018 englander dzignpak in october 2019 we used 146 million of cashonhand to invest in availableforsale afs marketable debt securities for more information see note 12 cash cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are included in the table below dollars in millions 

 



 

we expect capital investments in 2020 to be between 400 million and 425 million these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results strategic opportunities future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about 10 million in 2020 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations for additional information see “environmental matters” in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

at december 31 2019 the company had commitments for capital expenditures of 213 million the company believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments

financing activities

in 2019 net cash used for financing activities was 343 million compared to 427 million of cash used for financing activities in 2018 a decrease of 84 million we paid 31 million more in dividends on our common stock in 2019 299 million in total than in 2018 268 million in total and paid 124 million less in 2019 than in 2018 on our longterm debt net of proceeds received in 2019 we refinanced 900 million principal amount of our long term debt payments to redeem our old debt including redemption premiums exceeded the proceeds received from issuing the new debt by 27 million we also paid 8 million of debt issuance costs see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on the debt refinancing in 2018 we repaid at maturity 150 million principal amount of longterm debt from cash on hand 

 

commit ments 

contractual obligations

the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december 31 2019 for the categories described below some of the amounts included in the table are based on managements estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table below any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities dollars in millions

 



 









 









offbalancesheet arrangements

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2019

inflation and other general cost increases

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity

in 2019 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 59 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 54 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 59 million and cash costs by 54 million

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals

energy

in 2019 our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 97 million mmbtu’s of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2019 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs

 



 

in addition the mills purchased 2302 million ckwh hundred kilowatthours of electricity in 2019 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows

 



 

 

environme nt al matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are













we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we spent 41 million 40 million and 39 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally we had 9 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2019 7 million in 2018 and 9 million in 2017

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” established a threeyear deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pcas compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2019 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2019 we maintained an environmental reserve of 246 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 246 million accrued at december 31 2019 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity

pensions

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits  the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 13 employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2019 we had approximately 1589 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs net of tax recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans which is between seven and ten years and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of boise plans which is between 24 and 27 years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense

 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 

 



 

a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2019 and 2020 pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill impairment

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2019 we had 9187 million of goodwill of which 8635 million was recorded in the packaging segment and 552 million was recorded in our paper segment

we maintain two reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing packaging and paper which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 20 segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

under asu 201704 topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  companies are no longer required to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment thus eliminating step two of the analysis that was required under the prior guidance under asu 201704 goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company adopted this asu prospectively beginning with its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017

 

the update to the standard does not eliminate the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that is often used to determine if the quantitative assessment is necessary the qualitative assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance as well as company and reporting unit specific items if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value then no further testing is required otherwise the company would perform a quantitative analysis 

the quantitative analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values in calculating fair value we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows these estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience business expectations and the economic environment if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through an impairment charge

during the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value based on the results of the qualitative impairment test we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the packaging and paper reporting units

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates

longlived asset impairment

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period

we review the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates in 2019 and 2018 we recognized incremental depreciation expense of 03 million and 145 million respectively primarily related to the second quarter 2018 discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated oneside white paper grades at the wallula washington mill associated with the conversion of the no 3 paper machine to produce virgin kraft linerboard additionally in conjunction with the conversion of the no 3 paper machine we recognized an impairment loss of 31 million associated with the fiber farm asset group during 2018

packaging corporation of america “we” “us” “our” “pca” or the “company” is the third largest producer of containerboard products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet ufs in north america we operate six containerboard mills two white paper mills and 95 corrugated products manufacturing plants we are headquartered in lake forest illinois and operate primarily in the united states 

we report in three reportable segments packaging paper and corporate and other for segment financial information see note 18 segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k

during the second quarter of 2018 we discontinued the production of uncoated free sheet and coated oneside grades at the wallula washington mill and converted the no 3 machine to a virgin kraft linerboard machine subsequent to the date of conversion in may 2018 operating results for the wallula mill are primarily included in the packaging segment before such date operating results were included in the paper segment 

production and shipments

the following table summarizes the packaging segments containerboard production and corrugated products shipments and the paper segments white paper and market pulp production

packaging

packaging products

our containerboard mills produce linerboard and semichemical corrugating medium which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations and honeycomb protective packaging in addition we are a large producer of packaging for meat fresh fruit and vegetables processed food beverages and other industrial and consumer products

during the year ended december 31 2018 our packaging segment produced 41 million tons of containerboard at our mills our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold 589 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 59 billion in 2018 

 

faci lities 

we currently manufacture containerboard which includes a variety of performance and specialty grades at six containerboard mills total annual containerboard capacity was approximately 44 million tons as of december 31 2018 we also produce corrugated and protective packaging products at 95 manufacturing locations the following provides more details of our operations

counce our counce tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard on two paper machines the mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb 

deridder our deridder louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard and semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines the mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb to 69 lb and medium in basis weights of 23 lb to 33 lb 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill produces kraft linerboard on one paper machine the mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill produces semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines the mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb 

filer city our filer city michigan mill produces semichemical corrugating medium on three paper machines the mill can produce basis weights from 20 lb to 47 lb 

wallula our wallula washington mill produces semichemical corrugating medium on its no 2 machine and kraft linerboard on its no 3 machine the mill can produce medium in basis weights from 23 lb to 33 lb and linerboard in basis weights from 31 lb to 52 lb as described above the no 3 machine was converted from white paper to linerboard in may of 2018 

we operate 95 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations a technical and development center 10 regional design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 95 manufacturing facilities 61 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products 33 are sheet plants which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products and one is a corrugated sheetonly manufacturer

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs each of our plants serve a market radius of approximately 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2018 our usage of recycled fiber net of internal generation represents 18 of our containerboard production 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification™ pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through sel fgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas purchased wood waste and other purchased fuels each of our mill s selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2018 our packaging mills consumed about 70 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 70 million mmbtu’s consumed about 64 was from mill generated byproducts and 36 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 65 was from natural gas 31 was from purchased wood waste and 4 was from other purchased fuels

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard including caustic soda sulfuric acid soda ash and lime most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters

our containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products

customers

we sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 18000 customers in over 36000 locations about threequarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onequarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2017 fibre box association annual report

 



 

competition

as of december 31 2018 we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 460 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence

 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company westrock company georgiap acific llc and pratt industries however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent producers 

paper

we are the third largest manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content white papers consist of communication papers including cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers 

facilities

we currently have two white paper mills located in the united states total annual white paper capacity is 949000 tons the following paragraphs describe our white paper mills

jackson our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

international falls our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

wallula our wallula washington mill produced pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades on its no 3 machine prior to its conversion to kraft linerboard during the second quarter of 2018 

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment we consume wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp our jackson mill purchases recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchase and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification™ pefc as well as the forest stewardship council ® fsc and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

energy supply we obtain energy through selfgenerated or purchased fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste natural gas electricity and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity 

in 2018 our white paper mills consumed about 24 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 24 million mmbtu’s consumed about 62 was from mill generated byproducts and 38 was from purchased fuels of the purchased fuels 85 was from natural gas and 15 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda and sodium chlorate most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our white papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements

 

customers 

we have over 150 customers in approximately 450 locations these customers include office products distributors and retailers paper merchants and envelope and other converters we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment we have an agreement with office depot in which we will supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for commodity office papers through december 2019 the agreement will renew automatically through december 2020 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate in 2019 if this were to occur office depots purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years in 2018 our sales revenue to office depot represented 47 of our paper segment sales revenue

competition

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of white paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers in 2016 as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before united states international trade authorities antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in australia brazil china indonesia and portugal these duties remain in effect other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation international paper company and georgiapacific llc we also face competition from foreign producers although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our white papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers

corporate and other

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp

employees

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 15000 employees including 4500 salaried and 10500 hourly employees approximately 63 of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt the international association of machinists iam and the association of western pulp and paper workers awppw we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future during 2018 we experienced no work stoppages and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees

risk factors 

tableend

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below

 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties inves tors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in “part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including demand for our products industry capacity and decisions made by other producers with respect to capacity and other competitive conditions in our industry these factors are affected by general global and domestic economic conditions we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes of our products which may be unpredictable and volatile in addition our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices if supply exceeds demand industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed 

general economic conditions  if business political and economic conditions change in an adverse manner our business results of operations liquidity and financial position may be harmed general global and domestic economic conditions directly affect the levels of demand and production of consumer goods levels of employment the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business if economic conditions deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower disposable income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending we may experience lower demand for our products which is largely driven by demand for products of our customers which utilize our products if economic conditions result in higher inflation we may experience higher production and transportation costs which we may not be able to recover through higher prices or otherwise in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact global markets and demand for our and our customers’ products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments further changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities these conditions are beyond our control and may have a material impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal if we are unable to successfully compete we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition the industry is experiencing decreasing demand for existing white paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy selfsufficiency or lower operating costs compared to our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors into the markets we 

 

serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors pricing strategies changes in customer preferences and the costefficiency of our facilities 

inflation and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services general economic conditions may result in higher inflation which may increase our exposure to higher costs if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2018 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 59 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 54 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 59 million and cash costs by 54 million

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at five of our six containerboard mills and both paper mills in 2018 we purchased approximately 810000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past including during 2018 as demand for domestic recycled fiber from chinese producers declined significantly and may fluctuate significantly in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings a 10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately 7 million of additional expense based on 2018 consumption

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark and other purchased fuels fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels particularly coal and fossil fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings if we are unable to recover such increases through higher prices of our products a 010 per million mmbtu in natural gas prices would result in approximately 3 million of additional expense based on 2018 usage 

transportation costs  reduced truck and rail availability could lead to higher costs or poorer service resulting in lower earnings and harm our ability to distribute our products we ship our products primarily by truck and rail we have experienced lower availability of thirdparty trucking services and service issues interruptions and delays in rail services we have also experienced higher costs for transportation services in general if these factors persist we could experience even higher transportation costs in the future and difficulties shipping our products in a timely manner we may not be able to recover higher transportation costs through higher prices or otherwise which would result in lower earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 





 





















these events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines which may be significant or other adverse regulatory action because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur additional operating expenses andor significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers and other equipment in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

mergers and acquisitions  our acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations and we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses into our own we have completed several mergers and acquisitions and investments in recent years our success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate and receive the intended benefits from these acquisitions there may be difficulties costs and delays involved in the integration of these businesses into ours integration requires modification of operational and financial systems and may result in significant additional expenses if the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations or if we fail to successfully integrate these businesses our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

customer concentration  we rely on certain large customers our packaging and paper segments each have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect the segment’s sales and profitability in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results 

we have a supply agreement with office depot our largest customer in the paper segment the agreement requires office depot to buy and us to supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for commodity office papers through december 2019

 

in 2018 sale s to office depot represented 47  of our paper segment sales and 7 of our consolidated sales if t hese sales are reduced including if we ar e unable to renew the agreement at committed volumes we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial conditio n of office depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes office depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations 

labor relations if we experience strikes or other work stoppages our business will be harmed our workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements we must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future while we believe that we have satisfactory labor relations we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our business results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 

reliance on personnel  we may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel including key management personnel our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities produce our products and serve our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees changing demographics and labor work force trends may make it difficult for us to replace retiring employees at our manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience labor shortages we may experience higher costs and other difficulties and our business may be adversely impacted 

in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively as our business has grown in size and geographic scope we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex operations the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2018 we had 25 billion of debt outstanding and a 3269 million undrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit all debt is comprised of fixedrate senior notes we and our subsidiaries are not restricted from incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation













further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all

 

pension plans – our pension plans may require additional funding we record a liability associated with our pensions equal to the excess of the benefit obligations over the fair value of the assets funding the plans the actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be sensitive to changes in the a pplicable discount rates and returns on plan assets and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding fluctuations in the market performance of our plan assets will affect our pension plan costs in future periods changes in assumptions regarding expected longterm rate of return on plan assets our discount rate expected compensation levels or mortality will also increase or decrease pension costs 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors and other factors beyond our control this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock with little regard to our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

packaging segment income from operations was 1045 million in 2018 compared to 950 million in 2017 packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was 1401 million in 2018 compared to 1264 million in 2017 the increase was driven primarily by higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix and sales and production volumes driven by strong demand and lower recycled fiber costs partially offset by higher operating and converting costs higher freight and logistic expense and higher annual outage expense 

paper segment income from operations was 98 million in 2018 compared to 54 million in 2017 paper segment ebitda excluding special items was 165 million in 2018 compared to 145 million in 2017 the increase was due primarily to higher paper prices and mix lower operating costs and lower annual outage expense partially offset by higher freight and logistic expense and higher fiber costs

during the second quarter of 2018 the company discontinued production of uncoated freesheet and coated oneside grades at its wallula washington mill and converted the no 3 paper machine to a 400000 tonperyear virgin kraft linerboard machine the company incurred charges in the packaging and paper segments relating to these activities during 2017 and 2018 as described below under “special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items”

special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items 

earnings per diluted share excluding special items in 2018 and 2017 were as follows

 



 



















 

management excludes special items as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments a reconciliation of diluted eps to diluted eps excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such

 

industry and busi ness conditions 

trade publications reported north american industrywide corrugated products total shipments increased 17 during 2018 compared to 2017 reported industry containerboard production increased 17 compared to 2017 and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2018 were approximately 27 million tons up 117 compared to 2017 reported containerboard export shipments were flat compared to 2017 in march 2018 trade publications reported a 50 price per ton increase on linerboard and corrugating medium in january 2019 trade publications reported a 10 price per ton decrease on corrugating medium 

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers trade publications reported north american uncoated freesheet paper shipments were down 40 in 2018 compared to 2017 average prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers increased 83 per ton or 87 in 2018 compared to 2017

outlook

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019 we expect continued strong demand in our packaging segment for both containerboard volume and corrugated products volume and we expect strong market conditions in our paper segment to continue we anticipate higher labor and benefits costs with annual wage increases and other timingrelated expenses although we expect costs for freight and recycled fiber to be fairly flat we do anticipate some inflation with most of our chemical and repair and materials costs while seasonally colder weather will increase energy usage and wood costs we also expect our tax rate to be slightly higher finally the recent decrease in the published price for domestic medium will have a minimal effect on earnings considering these items we expect first quarter 2019 earnings excluding special items to be lower than fourth quarter 2018 we do not expect special items to be significant during the first quarter of 2019

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 362 million of cash and 327 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures acquisitions debt service common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions

 



 

operating activities

our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other accrued liabilities as well as other factors described below cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses

during 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was 1180 million compared to 856 million for 2017 an increase of 324 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased 231 million the increase was primarily due to higher income from operations in 2018 as discussed above and lower qualified pension plan contributions of 20 million made in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 cash increased by 93 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase was primarily due to the following a a reduction in taxes paid in 2018 as a result of the lower us corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21 and the utilization in 2018 of a federal overpayment from 2017 as a result of federal tax reform b lower accounts receivables levels in 2018 compared to 2017 due to fewer shipping days in december 2018 compared to december 2017 as well as timing of collections and c the receipt of the deridder insurance proceeds in the first quarter of 2018 these changes were partially offset by lower accounts payable levels in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily related to timing of payments 

 

during 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 856 million compared to 807 million for 2016 an increase of 49 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased 200 million the increase was primarily due to higher income from operations in 2017 as discussed above cash decreased by 151 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities the decrease was primarily due to higher accounts receivable levels in 2017 compared to 2016 because of increased sales and timing of collections and a higher federal and state income tax receivable in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an overpayment of required taxes made in 2017 prior to the enactment of tax reform these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable levels in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily related to timing of payments 

investing activities

we used 608 million for investing activities in 2018 compared to 609 million in 2017 in 2018 we spent 552 million for internal capital investments compared to 343 million in 2017 during 2018 we spent 56 million for acquisitions englander dzignpak compared to 274 million for acquisitions in 2017 sacramento container 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 are included in the table below dollars in millions 

 



 

we expect capital investments in 2019 to be between 390 million and 410 million these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results strategic opportunities future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about 10 million in 2019 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations for additional information see “environmental matters” in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

at december 31 2018 the company had commitments for capital expenditures of 113 million the company believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments

we used 609 million for investing activities in 2017 compared to 770 million in 2016 in 2017 we spent 343 million for internal capital investments compared to 274 million in 2016 during 2017 we spent 274 million for acquisitions sacramento container compared to 485 million for acquisitions in 2016 timbar and columbus container 

financing activities

in 2018 net cash used for financing activities was 427 million compared to 269 million of cash used for financing activities in 2017 an increase of 158 million the increase primarily relates to higher debt repayments and dividends in 2018 in march 2018 we repaid from cash 150 million of our maturing 65 senior notes we paid 268 million of dividends in 2018 compared to 238 million in 2017

in 2017 net cash used for financing activities was 269 million compared to 18 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2016 a change of 287 million in 2017 we paid down approximately 14 million of debt including scheduled principal payments on our term loan borrowings and the refinancing of those borrowings as described below in 2016 we increased our debt as we borrowed 385 million to finance the timbar acquisition in addition in 2016 we repurchased 100 

 

million of shares with n o such repurchase activity in 2017 we paid 238 million of dividends in 2017 compared to 216 million in 2016 

to reduce exposure to variable interest rates in december 2017 we issued a total of 1 billion in threeyear and tenyear notes with fixed interest rates of 245 and 340 respectively and used the proceeds to fully pay down our fiveyear and sevenyear term loans

contractual obligations

the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december 31 2018 for the categories described below some of the amounts included in the table are based on managements estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table below any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities dollars in millions

 



 









 











offbalancesheet arrangements

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018

inflation and other general cost increases

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity

in 2018 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 59 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 54 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 59 million and cash costs by 54 million

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals

energy

in 2018 our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 95 million mmbtu’s of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2018 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs

 



 

in addition the mills purchased 2241 million ckwh hundred kilowatthours of electricity in 2018 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows

 



 

 

environme nt al matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are













we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we spent 40 million 39 million and 44 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally we had 7 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2018 9 million in 2017 and 8 million in 2016

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” established a threeyear deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pcas compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how the recent decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2018 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2018 we maintained an environmental reserve of 273 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 273 million accrued at december 31 2018 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the brea dth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our m ills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any cl imate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity

pensions

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits  the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 11 employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2018 we had approximately 1279 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs net of tax recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans which is between seven and ten years and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of boise plans which is between 24 and 27 years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense

 

we believe that the accou nting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend o n economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pensio n expense in the following periods dollars in millions 

 



 

a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2018 and 2019 pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill impairment

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2018 we had 9173 million of goodwill of which during 2018 we recorded 286 million in connection with the acquisition of englander at december 31 2018 we had 8621 million and 552 million of goodwill recorded in our packaging and paper segments respectively

we maintain two reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing packaging and paper which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 18 segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

under asu 201704 topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  companies are no longer required to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment thus eliminating step two of the analysis that was required under the prior guidance under asu 201704 goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company adopted this asu prospectively beginning with its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017

 

the update to the standard does not elimin ate the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that is often used to determine if the quantitative assessment is necessary the qualitative assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditi ons industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance as well as company and reporting unit specific items if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that the ca rrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value then no further testing is required otherwise the company would perform a quantitative analysis 

the quantitative analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values in calculating fair value we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows these estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience business expectations and the economic environment if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through an impairment charge

during the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2018 we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value based on the results of the qualitative impairment test we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the packaging and paper reporting units

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates

longlived asset impairment

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period

we review the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates in 2018 and 2017 we recognized incremental depreciation expense of 145 million and 105 million respectively primarily related to the second quarter 2018 discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated oneside grades at the wallula washington mill associated with the conversion of the no 3 paper machine to a highperformance 100 virgin kraft linerboard machine additionally in conjunction with the conversion of the no 3 paper machine we recognized an impairment loss of 31 million and 135 million associated with the fiber farm asset group during 2018 and 2017 respectively

controls and procedures

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2018 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2018 

during the quarter ended december 31 2018 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018 based on the specified criteria

packaging corporation of america “we” “us” “our” “pca” or the “company” is the fourth largest producer of containerboard products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet ufs in north america based on production capacity we operate five containerboard mills three white paper mills and 94 corrugated products manufacturing plants we are headquartered in lake forest illinois and operate primarily in the united states 

we report in three reportable segments packaging paper and corporate and other for segment financial information see note 17 segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k

on october 2 2017 we acquired substantially all of the assets of sacramento container corporation and 100 of the membership interests of northern sheets llc and central california sheets llc for a cash purchase price of 265 million funded with cash on hand the acquired companies operate two fullline corrugated products operations and sheet feeders in mcclellan california and kingsburg california

during the third quarter of 2017 we announced that we would discontinue production of uncoated freesheet and certain types of pressure sensitive grades of white paper at our wallula washington mill in the second quarter of 2018 we will convert the no 3 paper machine at the mill to a 400000 tonperyear virgin kraft linerboard machine after the conversion the wallula mill will produce only containerboard

production and shipments

the following table summarizes the packaging segments containerboard production and corrugated products shipments and the paper segments production

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2017 our usage of recycled fiber net of internal generation represents 17 of our containerboard production 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc as well as the forest stewardship council fsc and we are certified under their sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics

 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process i ncluding black liquor and wood waste purchased wood waste and other purchased fuels each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process ste am is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2017 our packaging mills consumed about 63 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 63 million mmbtu’s consumed about 62 was from mill generated byproducts and 38 was from purchased fuels of the 38 in purchased fuels 61 was from natural gas 33 was from purchased wood waste and 6 was from other purchased fuels

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard including caustic soda and sulfuric acid most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products

customers

we sell corrugated products to over 18000 customers in over 35000 locations about threequarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onequarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2016 fibre box association annual report

 



 

competition

as of december 31 2017 we were the fourth largest producer of containerboard products in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 475 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence

 

on a national level our primary competitors are international pape r company westrock company georgiapacific llc kapstone paper and packaging corporation and pratt industries however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent producers 

paper

we are the third largest manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content white papers consist of communication papers cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers and pressure sensitive papers including release liners which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commerciallypackaged products 

facilities

we currently have three white paper mills located in the united states total annual white paper capacity is 990000 tons the following paragraphs describe our white paper mills

jackson our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

international falls our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines 

wallula our wallula washington mill has the ability on one machine to switch production between pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades the mill also produces corrugating medium as described above we are converting the no 3 machine at the mill from white paper to kraft linerboard upon the conversion the wallula mill will solely produce containerboard 

major raw materials used

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment we consume wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp our jackson mill purchases recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchase and we purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi and the forest stewardship council ® fsc and are certified under the sfi sourcing standards we procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the sfi and fsc standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources

energy supply we obtain energy through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas electricity byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity 

in 2017 our white paper mills consumed about 33 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 33 million mmbtu’s consumed about 63 was from mill generated byproducts and 37 was from purchased fuels of the 37 in purchased fuels 80 was from natural gas and 20 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda sodium chlorate dyestuffs and optical brighteners most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution

our white papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements

 

customers 

we have over 180 customers in approximately 500 locations these customers include paper merchants commercial and financial printers envelope converters and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment we have an agreement with office depot in which we will supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for commodity office papers through december 2018 the agreement will renew automatically through december 2019 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate in 2018 if this were to occur office depots purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years in 2017 our sales revenue to office depot represented 43 of our paper segment sales revenue

competition

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of white paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers in 2016 as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before united states international trade authorities antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in australia brazil china indonesia and portugal these duties remain in effect other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates in general paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas except in highly specialized or custom grades

our largest competitors include domtar corporation international paper company and georgiapacific llc we also face competition from overseas producers although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our white papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers

corporate and other

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport some of our products from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp

employees

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 14600 employees including 4400 salaried and 10200 hourly employees approximately 65 of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt the international association of machinists iam and the association of western pulp and paper workers awppw we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future during 2017 we experienced no work stoppages and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees

risk factors 

tableend

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below

 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materia lly from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise up date any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in “part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in our industry and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile in addition our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices if supply exceeds demand industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed 

general economic conditions  if business and economic conditions deteriorate our business results of operations liquidity and financial position may be harmed general global and us economic conditions directly affect the demand and production of consumer goods employment levels the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business if economic conditions deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending we may experience lower demand for our products and products of our customers which utilize our products if economic conditions result in higher inflation we may experience higher production and transportation costs which we may not be able to recover through higher prices or otherwise changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 and note 6 income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k for additional information on the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act hr1 enacted in december 2017 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal if we are unable to successfully compete we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition we are experiencing decreasing demand for most of our existing white paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy selfsufficiency or lower operating costs compared to our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors pricing strategies our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our inability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities

 

inflati on and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services general economic conditions may result in higher inflation which may increase our exposure to higher costs if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2017 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 55 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 51 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 55 million and cash costs by 51 million

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at four of our five containerboard mills as well as the containerboard machine at our wallula washington mill in 2017 we purchased approximately 670000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past including during 2017 as demand for domestic recycled fiber from asian producers fluctuated significantly and may occur again in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings a 10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately 7 million of additional expense based on 2017 consumption

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark and other purchased fuels fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels particularly coal and fossil fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings a 010 per million mmbtu in natural gas prices would result in approximately 3 million of additional expense based on 2017 usage 

transportation costs  reduced truck and rail availability could lead to higher costs or poorer service resulting in lower earnings and harm our ability to distribute our products we ship our products primarily by truck and rail we have experienced lower availability of thirdparty trucking services and interruptions or delays in rail services we have also experienced higher costs for transportation services in general these factors could lead to even higher transportation costs in the future and harm our ability to distribute our products in a timely manner we may not be able to recover higher transportation costs through higher prices or otherwise which would result in lower earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 











 















we experienced an explosion at the deridder mill during 2017 which resulted in facility downtime and damage net of insurance proceeds we incurred 5 million of property damage and business interruption losses during the year and we are party to multiple lawsuits relating to alleged injuries resulting from such explosion

these events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

mergers and acquisitions  our acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations and we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses into our own we have completed several mergers and acquisitions and investments in recent years including our acquisition of sacramento container corporation during 2017 our success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate and receive the intended benefits from these acquisitions there may be difficulties costs and delays involved in the integration of these businesses into ours integration requires modification of operational and financial systems and may result in significant additional expenses if the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations or if we fail to successfully integrate these businesses our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

customer concentration  office depot represents a significant portion of pca’s paper business we have a supply agreement with office depot our largest customer in the paper segment the agreement requires office depot to buy and us to supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for commodity office papers through december 2018 

in 2017 sales to office depot represented 43 of our paper segment sales and 7 of our consolidated sales if these sales are reduced including if we are unable to renew the agreement at committed volumes we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial condition of office depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes office depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations

labor relations if we experience strikes or other work stoppages our business will be harmed our workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements we must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future while we believe that we have generally had satisfactory labor relations we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our business results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 

 

reliance on personnel  we may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel including key management personnel our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities produce our products and serve our customers the increasing demand for qualified personne l may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees changing demographics and labor work force trends may make it difficult for us to replace retiring employees at our manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience labor shortages we may experience higher costs and other difficulties and our business may be adversely impacted 

in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively as our business has grown in size and geographic scope we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex operations the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2017 we had 27 billion of debt outstanding and a 3269 million undrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit all debt is comprised of fixedrate senior notes we and our subsidiaries are not restricted from incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation













further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors and other factors beyond our control this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

packaging segment income from operations was 944 million in 2017 compared to 711 million in 2016 packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was 1257 million in 2017 compared to 1019 million in 2016 the increase was driven primarily by higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix and sales and production volumes driven by strong demand partially offset by higher input costs primarily recycled fiber and energy higher labor costs and higher freight and depreciation expense 

paper segment income from operations was 62 million in 2017 compared to 138 million in 2016 paper segment ebitda excluding special items was 153 million in 2017 compared to 199 million in 2016 the decrease was due primarily to lower paper sales and production volumes and prices and mix higher energy costs and higher annual outage expenses

during the third quarter of 2017 the company announced that it will discontinue production of uncoated freesheet and coated oneside grades at its wallula washington mill in the second quarter of 2018 to begin the conversion of the no 3 paper machine to a 400000 tonperyear virgin kraft linerboard machine the company incurred charges in the paper segment relating to these activities during 2017 as described below under “special items and earnings per diluted share excluding special items” and will incur future charges the total capital cost of the conversion is expected to be approximately 150 million

also to further our corrugated products business growth strategy on october 2 2017 the company acquired substantially all of the assets of sacramento container corporation and 100 of the membership interests of northern sheets llc and central california sheets llc collectively the “sacramento container acquisition” for 265 million with cash on hand the acquired companies operate two fullline corrugated product operations and sheet feeders in mcclellan california and kingsburg california the operating results of the companies acquired in the sacramento container acquisition are included in our results and reported in the packaging segment from and after october 2 2017 we are in the process of integrating these operations into our business

 

 

during 2016 we made two acquisitions of corrugated products businesses in the packaging segment timbar corporation timbar and columbus container inc columbus container on august 29 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of timbar a large independent corrugated products producer with six domestic corrugated products production facilities for a purchase price of 386 million to finance the acquisition we borrowed 385 million under a new fiveyear term loan facility which we have subsequently refinanced on november 30 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of columbus container for a purchase price of 100 million columbus container is a fullservice provider of corrugated packaging products with a fullline corrugated products plant and warehousing facilities and other related operations located in indiana and illinois we used available cash on hand to pay the purchase price for columbus container the operating results of timbar and columbus container are included in our results and reported in the packaging segment from and after the respective dates of acquisition accordingly 2016 reflects a partial year of ownership of these operations and 2017 reflects a full year of ownership of these operations these operations have been substantially integrated into our business and have helped drive growth in our corrugated products volumes during 2017

on december 13 2017 we issued 1 billion of senior notes consisting of 500 million of three year notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 245 and 500 million of ten year notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 340 we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay all of our outstanding variablerate term loan debt which was approximately 976 million at the time of the offering as a result all of our outstanding longterm debt as of december 31 2017 bears interest at fixed rates

management excludes special items as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments a reconciliation of diluted eps to diluted eps excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such

industry and business conditions

trade publications reported north american industrywide corrugated products total shipments increased 25 during 2017 compared to 2016 reported industry containerboard production increased 31 compared to 2016 and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2017 were approximately 24 million tons up 33 compared to 2016 reported containerboard export shipments were up 41 compared to 2016 in 2017 trade publications reported a 50 price per ton increase on linerboard in april corrugating medium increased 50 20 and 10 per ton in april july and august respectively 

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers trade publications reported north american uncoated freesheet paper shipments were down 34 in 2017 compared to 2016 average prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers were lower by 19 per ton or 19 in 2017 compared to 2016  

outlook

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018 we expect continued strong demand in our packaging segment although our containerboard production and sales volumes will be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to scheduled outages at three of our mills during the quarter we will continue to implement our recently announced price increases in our paper segment and expect sales volume to be slightly lower we expect inflation in almost all areas across our entire cost base we anticipate continued higher freight costs as well as higher labor and benefits costs with annual wage increases and other timingrelated expenses although we anticipate price inflation on recycled fiber to be fairly flat we do expect some inflation in our energy costs and with most of our chemical and repair and materials costs and seasonally colder weather will increase energy usage and wood costs our depreciation and interest expense will be slightly higher as well we will benefit from a lower tax rate going forward with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act during the fourth quarter of 2017 considering these items and other items we expect first quarter earnings excluding special items to be slightly lower than fourth quarter 2017

liquidity and capital resources

sources and uses of cash

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 217 million of cash and 327 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures acquisitions debt service including voluntary payments of debt repurchases of common stock and declared common stock dividends we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such indebtedness our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions

 



 

operating activities

our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other accrued liabilities as well as other factors described below cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses

during 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 856 million compared to 807 million for 2016 an increase of 49 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased 200 million the increase was primarily due to higher income from operations as discussed above cash decreased by 151 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities the decrease was primarily due to higher accounts receivable levels in 2017 compared to 2016 because of increased sales and timing of collections and a higher federal and state income tax receivable in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an overpayment of required taxes made in 2017 prior to the enactment of tax reform these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable levels in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily related to timing of payments 

during 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was 807 million compared with 769 million for 2015 an increase of 38 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased 30 million the decrease resulted from 2016 cash contributions of 57 million to our pension plans partially offset by higher 2016 earnings changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash by 69 million this increase was primarily due to higher accounts payable levels in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the timing of payments lower required cash tax payments in 2016 resulting from utilization of prior year overpayments and an increase in accrued liabilities due primarily to higher compensation and benefits accruals these changes were partially offset by higher inventories at the end of 2016 in order to prebuild for planned maintenance outages that would reduce production in the first quarter of 2017 and higher accounts receivable levels related to differences in the timing of collections of receivables 

 

investing activities 

we used 609 million for investing activities in 2017 compared to 770 million in 2016 in 2017 we spent 343 million for internal capital investments compared to 274 million in 2016 during 2017 taking into account purchase price adjustments we spent 274 million for the sacramento container acquisition compared to 485 million for the timbar and columbus container acquisitions 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 are included in the table below dollars in millions 

 



 

we expect capital investments in 2018 to be between 440 million and 460 million including 134 million for the wallula no 3 paper machine conversion to kraft linerboard these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results strategic opportunities future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about 8 million in 2018 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and industrial boilers for additional information see “environmental matters” in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

at december 31 2017 the company had commitments for capital expenditures of 281 million the company believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments

we used 770 million for investing activities in 2016 compared to 298 million in 2015 in 2016 we spent 274 million for capital investments compared to 314 million in 2015 during 2016 we spent 485 million for the timbar and columbus container acquisitions in april of 2015 we received 23 million of cash proceeds for the sale of our hexacomb corrugated manufacturing operations in mexico and europe

financing activities

in 2017 net cash used for financing activities was 269 million compared with 18 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2016 a decrease of 287 million the change primarily related to changes in indebtedness during the respective years and higher dividend payments in 2017 compared to 2016 partially offset by 100 million of share repurchases in 2016 with no such repurchase activity in 2017 to reduce exposure to variable interest rates in december 2017 we issued a total of 1 billion in threeyear and tenyear notes with fixed interest rates of 245 and 340 respectively and used the proceeds to fully pay down our fiveyear and sevenyear term loans in 2016 we made 37 million of principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases and received 385 million of proceeds from the issuance of a term loan to finance the timbar acquisition resulting in a net increase in debt of 348 million we paid 238 million of dividends in 2017 compared to 216 million in 2016

in 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was 18 million compared to 411 million used for financing activities in 2015 an increase of 429 million the change primarily related to higher indebtedness and 54 million of lower repurchases of common stock in 2016 compared to 2015 indebtedness increased in 2016 as described above to fund the timbar acquisition in 2015 we reduced indebtedness with 48 million of principal payments we paid 216 million of dividends in 2016 compared with 201 million of dividends in 2015 on august 31 2016 pcas board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend to 063 per share from the previous 055 per share beginning with the dividend paid on september 15 2016

offbalancesheet arrangements

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017

inflation and other general cost increases

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity

in 2017 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 55 billion and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 51 billion a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 55 million and cash costs by 51 million

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals

energy

in 2017 our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 96 million mmbtu’s of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2017 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs

 



 

in addition the mills purchased 2168 million ckwh hundred kilowatthours of electricity in 2017 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows

 



 

 

environme nt al matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are













we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we spent 39 million 44 million and 43 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally we had 9 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2017 8 million in 2016 and 16 million in 2015

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” established a threeyear deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pcas compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how the recent decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2017 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2017 we maintained an environmental reserve of 315 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 315 million accrued at december 31 2017 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulatio n of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting futur e energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived f rom renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry wil l be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity

pensions

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation  retirement benefits” the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 10 employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2017 we had approximately 1421 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs net of tax recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans which is between seven to ten years and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of boise plans which is between 25 and 28 years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense

 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate bec ause it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retiremen t rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 

 



 

a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2017 and 2018 pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill impairment

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2017 we had 8832 million of goodwill of which during 2017 we recorded 1511 million in connection with the acquisition of sacramento container corporation at december 31 2017 we had 8280 million and 552 million of goodwill recorded in our packaging and paper segments respectively

we maintain two reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing packaging and paper which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 17 segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

under asu 201704 topic 350 “intangibles  goodwill and other – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” companies are no longer required to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment thus eliminating step two of the analysis that was required under the prior guidance under asu 201704 goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company adopted this asu prospectively beginning with its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017

 

the update to th e standard does not eliminate the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that is often used to determine if the quantitative assessment is necessary the qualitative assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances suc h as macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance as well as company and reporting unit specific items if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more l ikely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value then no further testing is required otherwise the company would perform a quantitative analysis 

the quantitative analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values in calculating fair value we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows these estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience business expectations and the economic environment if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through an impairment charge

during the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2017 we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value based on the results of the qualitative impairment test we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the packaging and paper reporting units

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates

longlived asset impairment

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period

we review the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates in 2017 we recognized incremental depreciation expense of 105 million primarily related to the announced second quarter 2018 discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated oneside grades at the wallula washington mill associated with the conversion of the no 3 paper machine to a highperformance 100 virgin kraft linerboard machine in 2016 we recognized incremental depreciation expense of 29 million primarily related to facilities closure costs and the wallula mill restructuring

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2017 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2017 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

on october 2 2017 pca acquired sacramento container corporation northern sheets llc and central california sheets llc collectively “sacramento container” we are currently in the process of evaluating and integrating sacramento container’s controls over financial reporting which may result in changes or additions to pca’s internal control over financial reporting under guidelines established by the sec companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company we excluded sacramento container from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2017 except as may relate to the sacramento container acquisition there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended december 31 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 sacramento container accounted for approximately 5 of the companys consolidated total assets and approximately 1 of consolidated net sales

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

facilities 

we manufacture our packaging products at five   containerboard mills one containerboard machine at our wallula washington white paper mill corrugated manufacturing operations and protective packaging operations the following provides more details of our operations 

counce our counce tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard the yearend 2016  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association afpa was 1104000 tons in 2016  the mill produced 1103000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines the mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

deridder our deridder louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard on its no 1 machine and linerboard and semichemical corrugating medium on its no 3 machine the yearend 2016  annual estimated capacity reported to the afpa on the two machines was 994000 tons the no 1 machine produced 645000 tons of kraft linerboard during 2016  the no 3 machine produced 180000 tons of linerboard and 168000 tons of medium the no 3 machine was converted from a newsprint machine to a containerboard machine in 2014 the mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb to 69 lb and medium in basis weights of 23 lb to 33 lb 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill produces kraft linerboard its yearend 2016  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 604000 tons in 2016  our single paper machine at valdosta produced 599000 tons of kraft linerboard the mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2016 our usage of recycled fiber net of internal generation represents 17 of our containerboard production 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 75000  acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 14 years remaining on average 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi and we are certified under the sfi sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste purchased wood waste and other purchased fuels each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2016  our packaging mills consumed about 60 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 60 million mmbtu’s consumed about 61 was from mill generated byproducts and 39 was from purchased fuels of the 39   in purchased fuels 69 was from natural gas 26 was from purchased wood waste and 5 was from other purchased fuels 

chemical supply  we consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard including caustic soda and sulfuric acid most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

 4 

customers 

we sell corrugated products to over 17000 customers in over 34000 locations about threequarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onequarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales 

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2015 fibre box association annual report 



competition 

as of december 31 2016  we were the fourth largest  producer of containerboard products in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 500 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150 mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company westrock company georgiapacific llc kapstone paper and packaging corporation and pratt industries however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent producers 

paper 

we are the third largest  manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content white papers consist of communication papers cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers and pressure sensitive papers including release liners which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commerciallypackaged products effective december 1 2016 we ceased softwood market pulp production at our wallula washington mill and permanently shut down the no1 machine with pulp capacity of approximately 100000 tons 

facilities 

we have three white paper mills located in the united states the following paragraphs describe our white paper mills

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is our principal raw material in this segment including wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp we purchase both whole logs and wood chips which are a byproduct of lumber and plywood production at our mill in jackson alabama we also purchase recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers our jackson and international falls paper mills also purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual arrangements we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchases 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi and the forest stewardship council ®  fsc and are certified under the sfi sourcing standards we procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the sfi and fsc standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources 

energy supply we obtain energy through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas electricity byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity 

in 2016  our white paper mills consumed about 30 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 30 million mmbtu’s consumed about 62 was from mill generated byproducts and 38 was from purchased fuels of the 38 in purchased fuels 85 was from natural gas and 15 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply  we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers and pulp including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda sodium chlorate dyestuffs and optical brighteners most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution 

our white papers are sold primarily by our own sales personnel we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements 

customers 

we have over 200 customers in approximately 500 locations these customers include paper merchants commercial and financial printers envelope converters and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment we have an agreement with office depot in which we will supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for commodity office papers through december 2017 the agreement will renew automatically through december 2018 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate in 2017 if this were to occur office depots purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years in 2016  our sales revenue to office depot represented 42  of our paper segment sales revenue 

competition 

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of white paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers and have experienced increased foreign competition in recent years the level of this competition varies depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates in general paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas except in highly specialized or custom grades 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation international paper company and georgiapacific llc we also face competition from overseas producers although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our white papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives

have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers 

corporate and other 

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport some of our products from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 14000  employees including 4200 salaried and 9800 hourly employees approximately 70 of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt the international association of machinists iam and the association of western pulp and paper workers awppw we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future including the agreement at our wallula washington paper mill with the awppw union which expires on march 14 2017   during 2016  we experienced no work stoppages and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees

risk factors 

tableend 

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words will should anticipate believe expect intend estimate hope or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement 

 8 

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity   macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in our industry and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile in addition our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices if supply exceeds demand industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed 

general economic conditions  adverse business and economic conditions or changes in tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position  general global and us economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods employment levels the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business high unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products and products of our customers which utilize our products changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal if we are unable to successfully compete we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition we are experiencing decreasing demand for most of our existing white paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows 

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy selfsufficiency or lower operating costs compared with our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors including overseas producers who have increased imports of white paper to the united states in recent years and have been found to have violated international trade rules into the markets we serve our competitors pricing strategies our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our inability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities 

 9 

inflation and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2016 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 50 billion  and excluding noncash costs depreciation depletion and amortization pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 46 billion  a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 50 million  and cash costs by 46 million  

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at four of our five containerboard mills as well as the containerboard machine at our wallula washington mill in 2016  we purchased approximately 630000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings a 10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately 6 million of additional expense 

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark and other purchased fuels fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels particularly coal and fossil fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings a 010 per million mmbtu in natural gas prices would result in approximately 3 million of additional expense based on 2016 usage 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

 

these events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

 10 

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

mergers and acquisitions  our acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations and we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses into our own we have completed several mergers and acquisitions and investments in recent years including our acquisitions of timbar and columbus container during 2016 our success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate and receive the intended benefits from these acquisitions there may be difficulties costs and delays involved in the integration of these businesses into ours integration requires modification of operational and financial systems and may result in significant additional expenses if the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations or if we fail to successfully integrate these businesses our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

customer concentration  office depot represents a significant portion of pca’s paper business we have a supply agreement with office depot our largest customer in the paper segment the agreement requires office depot to buy and us to supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for office papers through december 2017 

in 2016 sales to office depot represented 42  of our paper segment sales and 8 of our consolidated sales if these sales are reduced including if we are unable to renew the agreement at committed volumes we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial condition of office depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes office depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations 

labor relations if we experience strikes or other work stoppages our business will be harmed  our workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements we must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future while we believe that we have generally had satisfactory labor relations we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our business results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business   we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2016 we had 26 billion of longterm debt outstanding and a 3249 million undrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness includes 10 billion with floating interest rates an increase in interest rates will increase the amount we must pay to service our indebtedness 

 our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation 

 11 

 

further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

overview 

pca is the fourth largest producer of containerboard products in the united states and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet paper in the united states based on production capacity we operate five containerboard mills three paper mills and 94 corrugated products manufacturing plants our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations and honeycomb protective packaging in addition we are a large producer of packaging for meat fresh fruit and vegetables processed food beverages and other industrial and consumer products we also manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content we are headquartered in lake forest illinois and operate primarily in the united states 

during 2016 we made two acquisitions in our corrugated products business timbar corporation timbar and columbus container inc columbus container on august 29 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of timbar a large independent corrugated products producer with six corrugated products production facilities for a purchase price of 386 million to finance the acquisition we borrowed 385 million under a new fiveyear term loan facility timbar provides solutions to customers in the higher margin retail industrial packaging and display and fulfillment markets with a focus on multicolor graphics and technical innovation on november 30 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of columbus container for a purchase price of 100 million columbus container is a fullservice provider of corrugated packaging products with a fullline corrugated products plant and warehousing facilities and other related operations located in indiana and illinois we used available cash on hand to pay the purchase price the operating results of timbar and columbus container are included in our results and reported in the packaging segment from and after the respective dates of acquisition these acquisitions will accelerate the growth strategy and increase the containerboard integration level in our packaging segment 

executive summary 

we reported 450 million of net income or 475 per diluted share compared with 437 million or 447 per share in 2015 income included 19 million of pretax expense for special items in 2016 compared to 9 million in 2015 excluding special items we recorded 462 million of net income or 488 per diluted share in 2016 compared with 443 million and 453 per diluted share in 2015 the increase was driven primarily by increased containerboard and corrugated products volumes improved operating costs and a lower share count partially offset by lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix and lower paper volumes in 2016 we successfully completed the acquisitions of timbar and columbus container achieved a record 801 million of operating cash flow and returned 316 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

packaging segment income from operations was 711 million  compared with 715 million  in 2015 and earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and depletion ebitda excluding special items was 1019 million  compared with 1009 million  in 2015 volumes were up in both our containerboard mills and corrugated products plants in 2016 and we began implementing announced price increases during the fourth quarter higher volumes and improved operating costs were partially offset by unfavorable changes in containerboard and corrugated products price and mix compared with 2015 

paper segment income from operations was 138 million  compared with 112 million  in 2015 and ebitda excluding special items was 199 million  compared with 161 million  in 2015 the increase was primarily due to improved operating costs and favorable changes in price and mix partially offset by lower volume as a result of the 2016 shutdown of market pulp operations at our wallula washington mill

outlook 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2017 we expect to realize the vast majority of our previously announced packaging segment price increases and we expect higher corrugated products shipments with continuing strong demand we expect lower containerboard and paper production volume as we have scheduled maintenance outages on one of our machines at both the counce and deridder containerboard mills and on one of our machines at our jackson alabama paper mill we expect higher freight costs as well as higher labor and benefits costs with annual wage increases and other timingrelated expenses we also anticipate continued price inflation on recycled fiber energy and certain chemicals and seasonally colder weather is expected to increase wood and energy costs considering these items we expect first quarter earnings per share to be higher than fourth quarter 2016

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 239 million  of cash and 325 million  of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures acquisitions debt service including voluntary payments of debt declared common stock dividends and share repurchases we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions 



operating activities 

2016   

during 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was 801 million compared with 763 million for 2015 an increase of 38 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased 31 million the decrease was primarily driven by 2016 cash contributions of 57 million to our pension plans partially offset by record earnings in 2016 the remaining 69 million increase from changes in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was primarily due higher accounts payable levels in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the timing of payments lower required cash tax payments in 2016 resulting from utilization of prior year overpayments and an increase in accrued liabilities due primarily to higher compensation and benefits accruals these changes were partially offset by larger inventory prebuild for our first quarter 2017 planned maintenance outages and an increase in accounts receivable related to differences in the timing of collections of receivables cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

2015   

during 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 763 million compared with 736 million for 2014 an increase of 27 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased 1 million the remaining 28 million increase from changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities was primarily related 

 24 

to no inventory prebuild for our first quarter 2016 planned maintenance outages due to additional capacity added at our reconfigured deridder louisiana mill and a decrease in accounts receivable related to differences in the timing of collections of receivables these changes were partially offset by higher required cash tax payments resulting from less net operating loss utilization and a decrease in accrued liabilities due primarily to lower compensation and benefits accruals cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

investing activities 

2016   

we used 770 million  for investing activities in 2016  compared with 298 million  in 2015  in 2016  we spent 274 million   for capital investments compared with 314 million  in 2015  during 2016 we spent 485 million net of cash acquired for the timbar and columbus container acquisitions in april of 2015 we received 23 million of cash proceeds for the sale of our hexacomb corrugated manufacturing operations in mexico and europe 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  are included in the table below dollars in millions 



we expect capital investments in 2017 to be between 310 million and 325 million including capital required for boiler mact spending but excluding any acquisitions   these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations as discussed below under environmental matters in 2017 of up to 1 million and we expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 7 million in 2017 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and industrial boilers for additional information see environmental matters in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2016  pca had commitments for capital expenditures of   95 million  pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

2015   

we used 298 million for investing activities in 2015 compared with 451 million in 2014 in 2015 we spent 315 million for capital investments compared with 420 million in 2014 the decrease in capital spending was due primarily to 104 million invested in 2014 for the conversion of the no 3 newsprint machine at our deridder louisiana mill to produce containerboard we received 23 million of cash proceeds for the sale of our hexacomb corrugated manufacturing operations in mexico and europe during 2015 

 25 

financing activities 

2016   

in 2016  net cash used for financing activities changed by 429 million to a source of 24 million  compared with a use of 405 million  in 2015  the change primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of a new 385 million unsecured fiveyear term loan facility which pca fully borrowed to finance its acquisition of timbar corporation and lower repurchases of pca common stock in 2016 compared to 2015 in 2016  we made 37 million of principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases compared with 48 million of payments in 2015 during 2016 we paid 100 million to repurchase 1987187 shares of common stock and we withheld 172438 shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities of 11 million  compared with 155 million of share repurchases and 9 million  of shares withheld on equity award vesting in 2015  we paid 216 million  of dividends in 2016  compared with 201 million  of dividends in 2015  on august 31 2016 pcas board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend to 063 per share from the previous 055 per share beginning with the dividend paid on september 15 2016 

on february 25 2016 pca announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of 200 million of the companys outstanding common stock at the time of announcement there was no remaining authority under previously announced programs repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities regulations the timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by the company in its discretion based on factors such as pcas stock price and market and business conditions

2015   

in 2015 we used 405 million for financing activities compared with 351 million in 2014 the increase in cash used for financing activities primarily relates to share repurchases and increased dividend payments partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments net of proceeds received in 2015 we made 48 million of principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases compared with 194 million of payments net of debt proceeds received in 2014 in 2014 we also paid 3 million of financing costs we paid 201 million of dividends in 2015 compared with 157 million of dividends in 2014 on february 26 2015 pcas board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend to 055 per share from the previous 040 per share dividend beginning with the dividend paid on april 15 2015 during 2015 we paid 155 million to repurchase 2326493 shares of common stock and we withheld 129983 shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities of 9 million compared with no share repurchases and 13 million of shares withheld on equity award vesting in 2014 tax benefits from sharebased awards and proceeds from the exercise of stock options contributed 6 million in 2015 compared with 16 million in 2014

commitments 

contractual obligations 

the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december 31 2016  for the categories described below some of the amounts included in the table are based on managements estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table below any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities dollars in millions

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2016  

inflation and other general cost increases 

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2016 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 50 billion  and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 46 billion  a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 50 million  and cash costs by 46 million  

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals 

energy 

in 2016  our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 89 million mmbtu’s of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2016 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs 



in addition the mills purchased 2159  million ckwh hundred kilowatthours of purchased electricity in 2016 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows

environmental matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we spent 44 million 43 million and 44 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally we had 8 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2016 16 million in 2015 and 29 million in 2014 

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the epa established a threeyear deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pcas compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers and pca was set to achieve compliance by the deadline on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how the recent decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal superfund law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2015 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2016  we maintained an environmental reserve of 25 million  relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 25 million  accrued at december 31 2016  will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 29 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

pensions 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 10  employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits  

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2016  we had approximately 1215 million  of actuarial losses and prior service costs net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans which is between seven to ten years and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of boise plans which is between 26 and 29 years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 



a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2016  and 2017  pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2016  we had 7379 million  of goodwill of which during 2016 we recorded 1573 million in connection with the acquisition of timbar corporation and 366 million in connection with the acquisition of columbus container inc at december 31 2016  we had   6827 million  and 552 million   of goodwill recorded in our packaging and paper segments respectively 

we maintain two reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing packaging and paper which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 17  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

 31 

under asc 350 “intangibles  goodwill and other” companies have the option of performing either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis to test goodwill for possible impairment the qualitative analysis is commonly referred to as step 0 the step 0 assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance as well as company and reporting unit specific items if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value then no further testing is required otherwise the company would perform a quantitative analysis also known as the twostep impairment analysis below 

step one of the analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values in calculating fair value we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows these estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience business expectations and the economic environment if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company would then complete step two of the analysis in order to measure the impairment loss of the reporting unit this step requires the determination of the fair value of all the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as of the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through an impairment charge 

during the annual goodwill impairment test we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value based on the results of the step 0 goodwill impairment test we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the packaging and paper reporting units 

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

longlived asset impairment 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement   

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing 

 32 

from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates in 2016 we recognized incremental depreciation expense of 29 million primarily related to facilities closure costs and the wallula mill restructuring during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized 90 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to shortening the useful lives of assets at the deridder louisiana mill which primarily related to the newsprint business we exited in 2014

facilities 

we manufacture our packaging products at five   containerboard mills one containerboard machine at our wallula washington white paper mill corrugated manufacturing operations and protective packaging operations the following provides more details of our operations 

counce our counce tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard the yearend 2015  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association afpa was 1105000 tons in 2015  the mill produced 1087000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines the mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is consumed by our mills in 2015 we were a net recycled fiber buyer of less than 17 of our packaging mills fiber requirements 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 83000  acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 13 years remaining on average 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi and we are certified under the sfi sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste purchased wood waste coal and oil each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2015  our packaging mills consumed about 59 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 59 million mmbtu’s consumed about 59 was from mill generated byproducts and 41 was from purchased fuels of the 41   in purchased fuels 54 was from natural gas 32 was from purchased wood waste and 14 was from coal and other purchased fuels 

sales marketing and distribution 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium sales to our corrugated plants to outside domestic customers and to export customers this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments typically represent approximately 65 of the tons shipped and the remaining 35 is shipped by truck our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150 mile radius we sometimes use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

customers 

we sell corrugated products to approximately 17000 customers in over 33000 locations about threequarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic 

 4 

locations the remaining onequarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales 

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2014  fibre box association annual report 



competition 

as of december 31 2015  we were the fourth largest  producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging products in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 525 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150 mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company westrock company georgiapacific llc and kapstone paper and packaging corporation however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent producers 

paper 

our paper segment operating under the trade name boise paper was acquired with the acquisition of boise inc on october 25 2013  we are the third largest  manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content white papers consist of communication papers cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers and pressure sensitive papers including release liners which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commerciallypackaged products the paper segment also produces market pulp on one paper machine at our wallula washington mill which is sold to outside customers to produce paper products 

facilities 

we have three white paper mills located in the united states the following paragraphs describe our white paper mills 

jackson our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers its yearend 2015  annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines as reported to the afpa was 470000 tons in 2015  the mill produced 471000 tons of white papers on a converted basis from rollstock to cutsize white papers the mill produced 412000 tons in 2015  

international falls our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers its yearend 2015  annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines as reported to the afpa was 460000 tons in 2015  the mill produced 458000 tons of white papers on a converted basis from rollstock to cutsize white papers the mill produced 348000 tons in 2015  

wallula our wallula washington mill has the ability on one machine to switch production between pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades the mill also produces corrugating medium and market pulp its yearend 2015  annual estimated production capacity of white paper grades and market pulp as reported to the afpa was 190000 tons and 100000 tons respectively the corrugating medium produced at wallula is included in our packaging segment as discussed above in 2015  the mill produced 188000 tons of white papers and 99000 tons of market pulp

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is our principal raw material in this segment including wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp we purchase both whole logs and wood chips which are a byproduct of lumber and plywood production at our mill in jackson alabama we also purchase recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers our jackson and international falls paper mills also purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual arrangements we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchases 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi and the forest stewardship council ®  fsc and are certified under the sfi sourcing standards we procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the sfi and fsc standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources 

energy supply we obtain energy through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas electricity byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2015  our white paper mills consumed about 30 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 30 million mmbtu’s consumed about 66 was from mill generated byproducts and 34 was from purchased fuels of the 34 in purchased fuels 78 was from natural gas and 22 from purchased wood waste during the third quarter of 2015 we installed and started up a 53 megawatt turbine generator to replace four older units at our international falls minnesota mill with the new turbine generator the mill is now capable of producing 70 of its electrical power requirements compared to 38 previously 

chemical supply   we consume various chemicals in the production of white papers and pulp including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda sodium chlorate dyestuffs and optical brighteners most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution 

our white papers are sold primarily by our own sales personnel we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements rail shipments typically represent approximately 65 of the tons shipped and the remaining 35   is shipped by truck 

customers 

we have over 200 customers in approximately 500 locations these customers include paper merchants commercial and financial printers envelope converters and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment we have an agreement with office depot in which we will supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for commodity office papers through december 2017 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017 if this were to occur office depots purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years office depot became our largest customer when it acquired officemax incorporated late in 2013 we previously had a long standing contractual relationship with officemax incorporated in 2015  our sales revenue to office depot represented 45  of our paper segment sales revenue 

competition 

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of white paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers and have experienced increased foreign competition in recent years the level of this competition varies depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates in general paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas except in highly specialized or custom grades 

 6 

in january 2015 we along with the united steel workers usw and other domestic office paper producers filed a petition before the united states international trade commission and the united states department of commerce alleging that paper producers in china indonesia australia brazil and portugal are selling products in the united states in violation of international trade rules the domestic producers also alleged that chinese and indonesian producers are receiving illegal government subsidies the agencies conducted their investigations in 2015 and early 2016 in january 2016 the us department of commerce made determinations of antidumping and countervailing duties at rates varying by country and producer and in february 2016 the international trade commission determined that the domestic industry has been materially injured by these imports accordingly the antidumping and countervailing duties will be imposed on imports from these countries 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation international paper company and georgiapacific llc although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are also important competitive determinants our white papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage 

corporate and other

risk factors 

tableend 

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words will should anticipate believe expect intend estimate hope or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in our other filings with the 

 8 

securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement 

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity   macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in our industry and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline and our earnings and operating cash flows would be lower lower prices for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and operating cash flows our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and operating cash flows 

our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products as a result of such competition we are experiencing decreasing demand for most of our existing white paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for paper products is likely to further decline declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows 

some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy self sufficiency or lower operating costs compared with our company we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors including overseas producers who have increased imports of white paper to the united states in recent years and have been found to have violated international trade rules into the markets we serve our competitors pricing strategies our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our inability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities in february 2016 antidumping and countervailing duties were imposed on imports of certain white paper products from australia brazil china indonesia and portugal while these duties will increase the costs of producers in these countries to sell products in the united states we are unable to determine if domestic market conditions will improve 

inflation and other general cost increases  we may not be able to offset higher costs  we are subject to both contractual inflationary and other general cost increases including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2015 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 50 billion  and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 46 billion  a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 50 million  and cash costs by 46 million  

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions geography and regulatory activity 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at seven of our eight mills in 2015  we purchased approximately 605000 

 9 

tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in higher costs and lower earnings 

cost of purchased fuels and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including natural gas bark oil and coal fuel prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage reduce the availability of or make more expensive the use of certain fuels particularly coal and fossil fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if fuel and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

 

these events could harm our ability to serve our customers and lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

customer concentration  office depot represents a significant portion of pca’s paper business we have a supply agreement with office depot our largest customer in the paper segment the agreement requires office depot to buy and us to supply at least 50 of office depots requirements for office papers through december 2017 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017 if this were to occur office depots purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out office depot has agreed to be acquired by staples inc the pending acquisition by staples is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including regulatory approval which is uncertain if the acquisition of office depot by staples is consummated the risks described below may be intensified 

our agreement with office depot will continue to remain in effect after a merger or acquisition as to the office paper requirements of the legacy office depot business however we cannot predict how any merger or acquisition will affect the 

 10 

financial condition of the ultimate entity the paper requirements of the legacy office depot business the purchasing decisions of the ultimate entity or the effects on pricing or competition for office papers in 2015 sales to office depot represented 45  of our paper segment sales if these sales are reduced whether as a result of the future acquisition of office depot by staples or otherwise we would need to find new customers we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs any significant deterioration in the financial condition of office depot or its ultimate acquirer affecting its ability to pay or any other change that results in its willingness to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations 

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business   we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or operating cash flows 

debt obligations  our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2015 we had 23 billion of longterm debt outstanding and a 3265 million undrawn revolving credit facility after deducting letters of credit we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our ability to operate our business including without limitation 

 

further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

general economic conditions  adverse business and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position  general global economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods employment levels the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business high unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products and products of our customers which utilize our products these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position

industry and business conditions 

trade publications reported that industry corrugated products shipments increased 12 during 2015 compared with 2014 and 16 per workday with one less workday in 2015 reported industry containerboard production was 13 higher than 2014 with export shipments up 19 in the first two months of 2016 a trade publication lowered its published prices for domestic linerboard and medium by 15 and 30 per ton respectively 

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers trade publications reported that uncoated freesheet paper shipments were down 10 in 2015 compared with 2014 trade publication average prices for uncoated freesheet decreased 26 per ton or 25 in 2015 compared with 2014 

in january 2015 we along with the united steel workers usw and other domestic paper producers filed a petition before the united states international trade commission and the united states department of commerce alleging that paper producers in china indonesia australia brazil and portugal are selling products in the united states in violation of international trade rules the domestic producers also alleged that chinese and indonesian producers are receiving illegal government subsidies the agencies conducted their investigations in 2015 and early 2016 in january 2016 the us department of commerce made determinations of antidumping and countervailing duties at rates varying by country and producer and in february 2016 the international trade commission determined that the domestic industry has been materially injured by these imports accordingly the antidumping and countervailing duties will be imposed on imports from these countries 

 18 

outlook 

compared with fourth quarter 2015 we expect first quarter 2016 labor and benefits costs to be higher with annual wage increases and other timingrelated expenses and seasonally colder weather will increase wood and energy costs our tax rate will also be higher in the first quarter these items will be partially offset by slightly higher corrugated products shipments and containerboard production and lower scheduled mill outage costs finally lower published prices for domestic linerboard and medium are expected to adversely affect earnings as a result we expect first quarter 2016 earnings to be lower than fourth quarter 2015 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2015  compared with year ended december 31 2014   

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  are set forth below dollars in millions

packaging  sales decreased 630 million  or 14 to 44773 million  compared with 45403 million  in 2014  sales decreased 1150 million due to the exit from our newsprint business in third quarter 2014 and the april 1 2015 sale of our hexacomb operations in mexico and europe this decrease was partially offset by increased sales volumes in our corrugated products business 170 million and external containerboard sales 310 million total corrugated products volume sold in 2015 increased approximately 1 over 2014 our prices for corrugated products were approximately the same as 2014 with a full year of containerboard production on our d3 machine at our deridder louisiana mill we increased our outside sales of containerboard both domestic and export by 52000 tons compared with last year and we purchased 174000 less tons of containerboard from the outside market in 2015 our export prices were down 7 compared with 2014 while pricing for domestic containerboard sales was flat with last year containerboard mill production in 2015 was 3656000 total tons compared with 3452000 total tons in 2014 

 19 

paper  sales decreased 583 million or 49 to 11431 million  compared with 12014 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to 48 lower sales prices and changes in mix 576 million 

gross profit 

gross profit decreased 215 million  or 17  in 2015  compared with 2014  in 2015 and 2014 gross profit included expenses of 90 million and 581 million of special items respectively most of which related to incremental depreciation expense related to changing the estimated useful lives of assets in connection with our deridder mill restructuring excluding special items gross profit decreased 706 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower paper prices and changes in mix lower export containerboard prices and higher labor and benefit costs partially offset by higher packaging sales volume and lower energy chemical and freight costs gross profit was 210 of net sales in both 2015 and 2014 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 182 million  or 39  in 2015  compared with 2014  the decrease in 2015 was due primarily to lower administrative employee costs from the headcount reductions related to the boise integration

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1429 million  or 438  in 2014  compared with 2013  approximately 90 of the increase relates to the acquired boise businesses the remaining increase in our historical pca business is due primarily to a 120 million increase in salary and fringe benefit expenses and other increases which were individually insignificant

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 1842 million  of cash and 3265 million  of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service including voluntary payments of debt declared common stock dividends and share repurchases we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions 



 23 

operating activities 

2015   

during 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 7626 million compared with 7361 million for 2014 an increase of 265 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased 07 million the remaining 272 million increase from changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the following a no inventory prebuild for our first quarter 2016 planned maintenance outages due to additional capacity added at our reconfigured deridder louisiana mill and b a decrease in accounts receivable related to differences in the timing of collections of receivables these changes were partially offset by a higher required cash tax payments resulting from less net operating loss utilization and b a decrease in accrued liabilities due primarily to lower compensation and benefits accruals cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pcas operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

2014   

during 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 7361 million compared with 6082 million for 2013 an increase of 1279 million cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased 2162 million due to record earnings in 2014 which was driven by the acquisition of boise in fourth quarter 2013 cash used for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions totaled 970 million  in 2014    compared with 87 million  in 2013 the higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions in 2014  were driven primarily by higher containerboard and office papers inventory levels built in advance of four of our five containerboard mills and two of our three white papers mills taking maintenance outages in the first half of 2015 and lower accounts payable levels due to the timing of payments partially offset by a decrease in federal and state income taxes receivable at december 31 2014  compared with december 31 2013  

investing activities 

2015   

we used 2981 million  for investing activities in 2015  compared with 4511 million  in 2014  in 2015  we spent 3145 million   for capital investments compared with 4202 million  in 2014  the decrease in capital spending was due primarily to 1042 million invested in 2014 for the the conversion of the no 3 newsprint machine at our deridder louisiana mill to produce containerboard we received 230 million of cash proceeds for the sale of our hexacomb corrugated manufacturing operations in mexico and europe during 2015 in 2014 we paid 205 million to acquire the assets of crockett packaging a corrugated products manufacturer 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  are included in the table below dollars in millions 



we expect capital investments in 2016 to be between 2500 million and 2650 million including capital required for boiler mact spending but excluding any acquisitions   these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations as discussed below under environmental matters in 2016 of up to 30 million and we expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 50 million in 2016 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and industrial boilers for additional information see environmental matters in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 24 

at december 31 2015  pca had commitments for capital expenditures of   837 million  pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

2014   

we used 4511 million  for investing activities in 2014  compared with 14114 million  in 2013  in 2014  we spent 4202 million   for capital investments compared with 2344 million  in 2013  the increase in capital spending was due primarily to having a full year of boise capital investments including 1042 million for the the conversion of the no 3 newsprint machine at our deridder louisiana mill to produce containerboard in 2014  we spent 205 million  for the acquisition of crockett packaging in 2013  we spent 11745 million  on the acquisition of boise net of 1217 million of cash acquired 

financing activities 

2015   

in 2015  we used 4052 million  for financing activities compared with 3511 million  in 2014  the increase in cash used for financing activities primarily relates to share repurchases and increased dividend payments partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments net of proceeds received in 2015  we made 476 million  of principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases compared with 1936 million of payments net of debt proceeds received in 2014 in 2014 we also paid 34 million of financing costs we paid 2008 million  of dividends in 2015  compared with 1574 million  of dividends in 2014  on february 26 2015 pcas board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend to 055 per share from the previous 040 per share dividend beginning with the dividend paid on april 15 2015 during 2015 we paid 1547 million to repurchase 2326493 shares of common stock and we withheld 129983 shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities of 87 million  compared with no share repurchases and 132 million  of shares withheld on equity award vesting in 2014  tax benefits from sharebased awards and proceeds from the exercise of stock options contributed 60 million  in 2015  compared with 159 million in 2014  

subsequent to yearend we repurchased 1868487 shares of common stock for 934 million fully depleting the july 2015 authorization of 150 million on february 25 2016 pca announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200 million of the companys outstanding common stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities regulations the timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by the company in its discretion based on factors such as pcas stock price and market and business conditions

in 2014  we used 3511 million  for financing activities while financing activities provided 7868 million  in 2013  in 2014  we made 5925 million  of principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases and received 3989 million  of proceeds net of debt discount from longterm debt issuances for a net reduction in debt of 1936 million to reduce exposure to variable interest rates in september 2014 we issued 400 million of tenyear notes with a fixed interest rate of 365 and used the proceeds to pay down a portion of our fiveyear variablerate term loan in october 2013 we entered into 235 billion of new credit facilities including a 3500 million  revolver which remains undrawn we used the proceeds from borrowings under these facilities and cash on hand to finance the acquisition of boise repay 9536 million of indebtedness which included 8298 million of acquired boise debt and for general corporate purposes in addition in 2013 we repaid 122 million of outstanding debt prior to the acquisition of boise and repaid 1090 million under our receivables credit facility that we terminated in december 2013 in 2014 we also paid 34 million of financing costs compared with 194 million in 2013  we paid 1574 million  of dividends in 2014  compared with 1091 million  of dividends and 78 million  of common stock repurchases in 2013  the lower dividends paid in 2013  resulted from accelerating the dividends that would have been paid in january 2013 to december 2012 during 2014  we withheld 183170 shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities of 132 million  compared with 110 million  in 2013  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from sharebased awards contributed 159 million in 2014  compared with 107 million in 2013

commitments 

contractual obligations 

the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december 31 2015  for the categories described below some of the amounts included in the table are based on managements estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table below any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities dollars in millions

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015  

inflation and other general cost increases 

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2015 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 50 billion  and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and postretirement expense and sharebased compensation expense was 46 billion  a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 50 million  and cash costs by 46 million  

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals 

energy 

in 2015  our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 89 million mmbtu’s of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2015 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs 



in addition the mills purchased 2210  million ckwh hundred kilowatt hours of purchased electricity in 2015 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows

environmental matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we spent 426 million 439 million and 411 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal superfund law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however office depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification 

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the epa established a three year deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers pca’s compliance actions involve modifying or replacing certain of its boilers   pca estimates that its remaining boiler mact compliance obligations will require capital expenditures of 30 million in 2016 we currently expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 50 million in 2016 total capital expenditures for environmental matters were 160 million in 2015  290 million in 2014  and 62 million for 2013 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 2006 through 2015 there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pcas mills and corrugated plants as of december 31 2015  we maintained an environmental reserve of 243 million  relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 243 million  accrued at december 31 2015  will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and 

 29 

the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

pensions 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 11  employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits  

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2015  we had approximately 1033 million  of actuarial losses net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees which is between seven to ten years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense 

 30 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 



a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2015  and 2016  pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill and intangible asset impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2015  we had 5440 million  of goodwill of which we recorded 4586 million  in connection with the acquisition of boise in fourth quarter 2013 at december 31 2015  we had   4888 million  and 552 million   of goodwill recorded in our packaging and paper segments respectively all of our intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we maintain two reporting units for purposes of our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing packaging and paper which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 18  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value

in conducting our goodwill impairment analysis we utilize the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model level 3 measurement the fair value was also calculated using the market approach based primarily on comparable company ebitda multiples level 2 measurement and was compared to and supported the fair value based upon the discounted cash flow approach we believe that the discounted cash flow model captures our estimates regarding the results of our future prospects however we also considered the markets expectations based on observable market information the discounted cash flow model estimates the projected future cash flows to be generated by our reporting units discounted to present value using a discount rate for a potential market participant the market approach estimates fair value based on multiples of ebitda the following assumptions are key to our estimates of fair value 

business projections the discounted cash flow model utilizes business projections that are developed internally by management for use in managing the business these projections include significant assumptions such as estimates of future revenues profits income taxes and capital expenditures our forecasts take into consideration recent sales data for existing products planned timing of capital projects and key economic indicators to estimate future production volumes selling prices   and key input costs for our manufactured products our pricing assumptions are estimated based upon an assessment of industry supply and demand dynamics for our major products 

growth rates a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow model the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings or revenue is projected to grow beyond the forecast period 

discount rates future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise the discount rates selected are based on existing conditions within our industry and reflect adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt 

ebitda multiples  the market approach requires the use of a valuation multiple to calculate the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we use an ebitda multiple based on a selection of comparable companies and recent acquisition transactions within our industries 

based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our packaging and paper reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying amount and therefore no goodwill impairment existed as a result the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required to be completed 

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill and intangible assets as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

longlived asset impairment 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly 

 32 

the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement   

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we recognized 90 million and 420 million respectively of accelerated depreciation expense related to shortening the useful lives of assets at the deridder louisiana mill which primarily related to the newsprint business we exited in 2014 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes and separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense and our tax basis in assets and liabilities 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities we also recognize only the impact of tax positions that based on their technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex us and foreign tax regulations exposures from not filing in some jurisdictions and transfer pricing exposures from allocation of income between jurisdictions it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate uncertain tax positions because we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2015  the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2015  

during the quarter ended december 31 2015  there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

packaging 

packaging products 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of packaging for meat fresh fruit and vegetables processed food beverages and other industrial and consumer products 

during the year ended december 31 2014  our packaging segment produced 35 million  tons of containerboard at our mills our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 482 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 45 billion  in 2014  

on october 17 2014 we completed the no 3 newsprint machine conversion at the deridder louisiana mill to produce containerboard after startup the converted machine produced 58000 tons of containerboard during the fourth quarter we stopped producing newsprint in september 2014 

 2 

facilities 

we manufacture our packaging products at five   containerboard mills one containerboard machine at our wallula washington white paper mill corrugated manufacturing operations and protective packaging operations the following provides more details of our operations 

counce our counce tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association afpa was 1070000 tons in 2014  the mill produced 1079000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines the mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

deridder our deridder louisiana mill acquired as part of the boise acquisition produces kraft linerboard on its no 1 machine and linerboard and medium on its newlyconverted no 3 machine the yearend 2014  estimated capacity reported to the afpa on the two machines was 935000 tons the no 1 machine produced 601000 tons of kraft linerboard during 2014  the no 3 machine which was converted from a newsprint machine and began operation as a containerboard machine on october 17 2014 produced 46000 tons of medium and 12000 tons of linerboard after conversion the mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb to 69 lb and medium in basis weights of 23 lb to 33 lb 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill produces kraft linerboard its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 570000 tons in 2014  our single paper machine at valdosta produced 573000 tons of kraft linerboard the mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill produces semichemical corrugating medium its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 555000 tons in 2014  the mill produced 555000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines the tomahawk mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

filer city our filer city michigan mill produces semichemical corrugating medium its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 440000 tons in 2014  the mill produced 444000 tons on three paper machines filer city can produce corrugating medium in basis weight from   20 lb to 47 lb 

wallula    our wallula washington mill acquired as part of the boise acquisition primarily produces white paper but also produces corrugating medium on one of its paper machines its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity of medium as reported to the afpa was 145000 tons in 2014  the mill produced 142000 tons of corrugating medium wallula can produce corrugating medium in basis weights from 23 lb to 45 lb 

we operate 99  corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center eight regional design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 99  manufacturing facilities 65 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers 33 are sheet plants which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated containers and one  is a corrugated sheetonly manufacturer 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 32 states in the us we also have hexacomb converting operations outside of the continental us including three facilities in europe two in mexico and one in canada 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs each of our plants serve a market radius of around 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements in 2014 we were a net recycled fiber buyer of less than 13 of our packaging mills fiber requirements 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000  acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 14 years remaining on average 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi and we are certified under the sfi sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste purchased wood waste coal and oil each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2014  our packaging mills consumed about 59 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 59 million mmbtu’s consumed about 59 was from mill generated byproducts and 41 was from purchased fuels of the 41   in purchased fuels 41 was from natural gas 38 was from purchased wood waste and 14 was from coal 

sales marketing and distribution 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium sales to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to export customers this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments typically represent approximately 65 of the tons shipped and the remaining 35 is comprised of truck shipments our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150 mile radius we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

customers 

we sell corrugated products to approximately19000 customers in over 30000 locations about threequarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic 

 4 

locations the remaining onequarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales 

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2013  fibre box association annual report 



competition 

as of december 31 2014  we are the fourth largest  producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 535 us companies operating approximately 1200 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150 mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated product operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence and competition varies based on each type of corrugated container we sell 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company rocktenn company georgiapacific llc and kapstone paper and packaging corporation however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

paper 

our paper segment operating under the trade name boise paper was acquired with the acquisition of boise inc on october 25 2013  we are the third largest  manufacturer of white papers in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates we manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content white papers consist of communication papers cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers and pressure sensitive papers including release liners which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commerciallypackaged products the paper segment also produces market pulp on one paper machine at our wallula washington mill which is sold to outside customers to produce paper products 

facilities 

we have three white paper mills located in the united states the following paragraphs describe our white paper mills 

jackson     our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines as reported to the afpa was 490000 tons in 2014  the mill produced 494000 tons of white papers on a converted basis from rollstock to cutsize white papers the mill produced 416000 tons in 2014  

international falls     our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines as reported to the afpa was 455000 tons in 2014  the mill produced 457000 tons of white papers on a converted basis from rollstock to cutsize white papers the mill produced 335000 tons in 2014  

wallula    our wallula washington mill has the ability on one machine to switch production between pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades the mill also produces corrugating medium and market pulp its yearend 2014  annual estimated production capacity of white paper grades and market pulp as reported to the afpa was 190000 tons 

 5 

and 100000 tons respectively the corrugating medium produced at wallula is included in our packaging segment as discussed above in 2014  the mill produced 193000 tons of white papers and 100000 tons of market pulp 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply   fiber is our principal raw material in this segment including wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp we purchase both whole logs and wood chips which are a byproduct of lumber and plywood production at our mill in jackson alabama we also purchase recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers our jackson and international falls paper mills also purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual arrangements we negotiate these arrangements periodically and terms can fluctuate based on prevailing pulp market conditions including pricing and supply dynamics 

we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchases our contracts are generally with suppliers located in close proximity to the specific facility they supply and they commonly contain price adjustment mechanisms to account for market price and expense volatility 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi and the forest stewardship council ®  fsc and are certified under the sfi sourcing standards we procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the sfi and fsc standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources 

energy supply we obtain energy through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas electricity byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2014  our white paper mills consumed about 29 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 29 million mmbtu’s consumed about 64 was from mill generated byproducts and 36 was from purchased fuels of the 36 in purchased fuels 71 was from natural gas and 29 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply     we consume a significant amount of chemicals in the production of white papers and pulp including starch precipitated calcium carbonate caustic soda sodium chlorate dyestuffs and optical brighteners most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which may contain price adjustment mechanisms or fixed prices designed to provide greater pricing stability than openmarket purchases these contracts are bid or negotiated periodically 

sales marketing and distribution 

our white papers are sold primarily by our own sales personnel we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements rail shipments typically represent approximately 70 of the tons shipped and the remaining 30   is comprised of truck shipments 

customers 

we have over 200 customers in approximately 500 locations these customers include paper merchants commercial and financial printers envelope converters and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers officemax incorporated officemax a whollyowned subsidiary of office depot inc is our largest customer in the paper segment we have an agreement with officemax in which we will supply at least 80 of officemaxs requirements for commodity office papers through december 2017 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017 if this were to occur officemaxs purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years officemax was acquired by office depot inc late in 2013 in 2014  our sales revenue to office depot including officemax represented 44  of our paper segment sales revenue 

competition 

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of white paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in 

 6 

the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers and have experienced increased foreign competition in recent years the level of this competition varies depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates in general paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas except in highly specialized or custom grades 

in january 2015 we along with the united steel workers usw and other domestic paper producers filed a petition before the united states international trade commission and the united states department of commerce alleging that paper producers in china indonesia australia brazil and portugal are selling products in the united states andor receiving government subsidies in violation of international trade rules the agencies will investigate the claims over the next 12 to 15 months if the investigations determine that trade rules were violated then antidumping andor countervailing duties will be imposed on imports from the countries found in violation we cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these investigations 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation international paper company and georgiapacific llc although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are important competitive determinants our white papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage 

corporate and other 

our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities and foreign exchange gains and losses this segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks which we use to transport our products from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50 owned variable interest entity louisiana timber procurement company llc ltp for segment financial information see note 18  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 14000  employees including 4300  salaried employees and 9700  hourly employees approximately 75  of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt the international association of machinists iam and the association of western pulp and paper workers awppw   we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future including the agreements at our jackson alabama paper mill which expired august 31 2014 and deridder tomahawk and a portion of international falls mill which all expire in 2015 during 2014  we experienced no work stoppages and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees

risk factors 

tableend 

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words will should anticipate believe expect intend estimate hope or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward

looking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement 

industry risks 

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity   macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in our industry and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which are often volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations additionally market conditions beyond our control can affect the prices for our commodity products if the prices for our products decline or if we are unable to control our costs it could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

several of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy self sufficiency or lower operating costs compared with our company we may be unable to compete with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors including overseas producers who have increased imports of white paper to the united states in recent years and some of whom we believe may be violating international trade rules into the markets we serve our competitors pricing strategies our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our inability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities 

company risks 

inflation and other general cost increases  we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect of our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2014 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 51 billion  and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and sharebased compensation expense was 47 billion  a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 51 million  and cash costs by 47 million  

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals 

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and 

 9 

transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions and geography 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at seven of our eight mills in 2014  we purchased approximately 493000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage or make more expensive the use of certain fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

 

these events could harm our ability to serve our customers and lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations including new us environmental protection agency rules relating to industrial boiler emissions known as the boiler mact rules are expected to require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

customer concentration  officemax represents a significant portion of pca’s paper business we have a supply agreement with officemax our largest customer in the paper segment the agreement requires officemax to buy and us to supply at least 80 of officemax’s requirements for office papers through december 2017 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017 if this were to occur officemaxs purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years officemax was acquired by office depot inc late in 2013 office depot has since 

 10 

agreed to be acquired by staples inc on february 4 2015 the pending acquisition by staples is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions if the acquisition of office depot by staples is consummated the risks described below may be intensified 

our agreement with officemax will continue to remain in effect after a merger or acquisition as to the office paper requirements of the legacy officemax business however we cannot predict how any merger or acquisition will affect the financial condition of the ultimate entity the paper requirements of the legacy office max business the purchasing decisions of the ultimate entity or the effects on pricing or competition for office papers in 2014 sales to office depot including office max represented 44  of our paper segment sales if these sales are reduced whether as a result of the pending integration of office max into office depot the future acquisition of office depot by staples or otherwise we would need to find new customers which could harm our profitability if our prices are lower or costs are higher any significant deterioration in the financial condition of the ultimate entity affecting its ability to pay or any other change that results in its willingness to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations 

acquisition integration  the acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations and we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses the acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations which may cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations if the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations or if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business   we rely on various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other repercussions resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or cash flows 

risks related to economic financial and investment risk 

increased leverage may reduce our operating flexibility at december 31 2014 we had 23 billion of longterm debt outstanding and a 3500 million undrawn revolving credit facility we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current borrowings plus any future borrowings may affect our future operations including without limitation 

 

further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of the stock to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

general economic conditions  adverse business and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position  general global economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods employment levels the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business high unemployment rates lower family income lower corporate earnings lower business 

 11 

investment and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position

executive summary 

in 2014 sales grew 597  to a record 58526 million  we reported 3926 million  of net income or 399  per diluted share in 2014 compared with 4413 million  or 452  per share in 2013 excluding the special items discussed below we recorded 4586 million  of net income or a record 466  per diluted share in 2014 compared with 3252 million  and 333  per diluted share in 2013 packaging segment income was 6632 million  compared with 5542 million  in 2013 and earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and depletion ebitda excluding special items was 10150 million  compared with 7747 million  in 2013 paper segment income was 1354 million  compared with 135 million  in 2013 and ebitda excluding special items was 1860 million  compared with 242 million  for the two months and five days after the boise acquisition in 2013 

compared with 2013 the improvement in our 2014 financial results excluding special items was primarily due to the boise acquisition in october 2013 the acquisition was significantly accretive to our earnings before special items due to earnings generated by boise as well as the synergies generated from the integration of its packaging business and operational improvements in the white papers business 

on october 17 2014 we completed the no 3 newsprint machine conversion at the deridder louisiana mill to produce containerboard which will provide our containerboard mill system with needed capacity and reduce our outside purchases of containerboard after startup the machine produced 58000 tons during the fourth quarter 

in 2014 our results included 1033 million 477 million noncash and 556 million cash of pretax expense from special items compared with 873 million of income from special items in 2013 the 2014 special items included 658 million  461 million noncash and 197 million cash of expenses related to the deridder mill restructuring 199 million 17 million noncash and 182 million cash of boise acquisition integrationrelated debtrefinancing and other costs and 176 million of cash expense related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit special items in 2013 included 1660 million of income from the reversal of previously established tax reserves partially offset by 678 million of pretax costs primarily related to the acquisition of boise and 109 million of pension plan curtailment charges

earnings per diluted share excluding special items in 2014  and 2013  were as follows 



 

 

management excludes special items and uses nongaap measures to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliation of diluted eps to diluted eps excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

industry and business conditions 

trade publications reported that industrywide corrugated products shipments increased 12 during 2014 compared with 2013 in 2014 our corrugated products shipments including boise increased 255 over last year and 250 per workday with one more workday in 2014 excluding boise shipments corrugated products shipments increased 47 in total or 43 per workday the acquisition of crockett packaging in april 2014 contributed about 10 to the increase in shipments reported industry containerboard production was 18 higher than 2013 with export shipments up 63 pca containerboard 

 18 

mill production in 2014 was 3452000 total tons including 801000 tons from boise compared with 2749000 total tons in 2013 which included 141000 tons from boise with strong internal containerboard demand needed to supply our box plants we reduced our outside sales of containerboard both domestic and export by 46000 tons compared with last year and we purchased 182000 tons of containerboard from the outside market in 2014 our domestic containerboard pricing remained steady throughout 2014 while our export pricing decreased slightly due in part to a stronger us dollar 

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers in 2014 we elected to exit some business which lowered our office paper shipments our office paper shipments decreased 21 or 16000 tons in 2014 compared with boises shipments last year our printing and converting papers and pressure sensitive papers shipments were down about 185 or 81000 tons compared with 2013 as a result of closing two paper machines at the international falls minnesota mill in fourth quarter 2013 in 2014 our white paper mills produced 1144000 tons in 2014 our average price for all products produced in our paper segment was 996 per ton compared with the 2013 average price of 984 per ton 

outlook 

in the first quarter of 2015 we expect lost containerboard production of about 60000 tons and higher operating costs from annual maintenance outages at counce and deridder our two largest containerboard mills and two less production days compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 corrugated products shipments are expected to be seasonally lower and white paper prices are expected to be lower from the impact of published price decreases in november and december 2014 and changes in mix seasonally colder weather will increase wood energy and chemical costs in addition labor and benefit costs will be higher with annual wage increases and timingrelated fringe benefit increases these items will be partially offset by higher production on the deridder no 3 paper machine as a result we expect first quarter earnings excluding special items to be lower than fourth quarter 2014

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  are set forth below dollars in millions 



 

 

net sales 

net sales increased 21873 million  or 597  to a record 58526 million  in 2014  compared with 36653 million  in 2013  the increase in 2014  related to a full year of boise operations compared with only two months and five days in 2013 19628 million and increased sales in pcas historical operations 2245 which resulted from higher sales volumes and higher sales prices and mix 

packaging  sales increased 11086 million  or 323 to 45403 million  compared with 34317 million  in 2013  a full year of boise operations contributed 8787 million of the increase and the remaining increase related to higher sales volumes 1605 million and higher sales prices and mix 694 million in pcas historical operations total corrugated products volume sold in 2014 including boise increased 255 over 2013 and shipments per workday increased 250 the year ended december 31 2014 included 251 workdays those days not falling on a weekend or holiday compared with 250 workdays   in 2013 excluding boise shipments corrugated products shipments increased 47 in total or 43 per workday in 2014 compared with 2013 the acquisition of crockett packaging in april 2014 contributed about 10 to the increase in shipments with the rest of the increase coming from organic growth we reduced our outside sales of containerboard both domestic and export by 46000 tons compared with last year and we purchased 182000 tons of containerboard from the outside market in 2014 containerboard mill production in 2014 was 3452000 total tons including 801000 tons from boise compared with 2749000 total tons in 2013 which included 141000 tons from boise 

paper  our paper segment sales include the sales for the white paper mills we acquired from boise sales for 2014 were 12014 million  in 2013 sales during the two months and five days we owned boise were 2169 million in 2014 sales volumes of white paper were 1114000 tons compared with 210000 tons in 2013 for the period we owned boise 

 20 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 3620 million  or 417  in 2014  compared with 2013  in 2014 gross profit included 581 million of expense from special items most of which related to restructuring charges at our deridder louisiana mill including incremental depreciation related to changing the estimated useful lives of newsprintrelated assets in connection with our exit from the newsprint business in september 2014 in 2013 gross profit included 215 million of expense from special items related to the stepup in value of inventory acquired in the boise acquisition excluding special items gross profit increased 3986 million approximately 90 of the increase was due to a full year of boise operations including realized synergies and the remaining increase was from higher gross profit in pcas historical packaging operations due to higher sales prices volume and mix partially offset by increases in costs for labor depreciation freight wood fiber and chemical expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 210 of net sales in 2014  compared with 237 in 2013 due primarily to a full year impact of the white papers business whose products generally have lower margins than the products sold in the packaging business and the deridder restructuring charges described above 

selling general and administrative expenses

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 1249 million  of cash and 3251 million  of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service including voluntary payments of debt and declared common stock dividends we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions 



our foreign operations are not material to our financial position or results of operations at december 31 2014  we had 104 million  of cash and shortterm investments held in operations outside of the united states we indefinitely reinvest our earnings in operations outside the united states however if foreign earnings were repatriated at a future date we would need to accrue and pay taxes it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these 

 24 

undistributed earnings because the actual tax liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing when the repatriation occurs 

operating activities 

2014   

the major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items increased 2160 million due to record earnings in 2014 which was driven by the acquisition of boise in fourth quarter 2013 cash used for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions totaled 970 million  in 2014    compared with 87 million  in 2013 the higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions in 2014  were driven primarily by higher containerboard and office papers inventory levels built in advance of four of our five containerboard mills and two of our three white papers mills taking maintenance outages in the first half of 2015 and lower accounts payable levels due to the timing of payments partially offset by a decrease in federal and state income taxes receivable at december 31 2014  compared with december 31 2013  cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca’s operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

2013   

in 2013  net cash provided by operating activities was 6082 million  compared with 4042 million  in 2012  an increase   of 2040 million approximately 675 or 1377 million of the increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the increase in income from our operations in 2013 which we discuss above under operating results and two months and five days of income included in 2013 from the newly acquired boise operations in addition we used an additional 72 million of alternative energy tax credits to reduce federal income tax payments during 2013 compared with 2012 cash used for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions totaled 87 million in 2013   compared with 749 million in 2012 the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions in 2013 were driven primarily by higher accounts payable and lower inventory levels partially offset by lower accrued liabilities at december 31 2013  compared with december 31 2012  

investing activities 

2014   

we used 4511 million  for investing activities in 2014  compared with 14114 million  in 2013  in 2014  we spent 4202 million   for capital investments compared with 2344 million  in 2013  the increase in capital spending was due primarily to having a full year of boise capital investments including 1042 million for the the conversion of the no 3 newsprint machine at our deridder louisiana mill to produce containerboard in 2014  we spent 205 million  for the acquisition of crockett packaging a corrugated products manufacturer in 2013  we spent 11745 million  on the acquisition of boise net of 1217 million of cash acquired 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  are included in the table below dollars in millions 



we expect capital investments in 2015 to be between 2750 million and 3000 million including capital required for synergies and boiler mact spending but excluding any acquisitions   these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations as discussed below under environmental matters in 2015 of up to 160 million and we expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 50 million in 2015 

 25 

our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and industrial boilers for additional information see environmental matters in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2014  pca had commitments for capital expenditures of   947 million  pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

2013   

net cash used for investing activities in 2013 increased 13039 million  to 14114 million  compared with 1075 million in 2012 in 2013 we paid 11745 million  for the acquisition of boise net of 1217 million of cash acquired while in 2012 we spent 354 million on the acquisition of our cheswick pennsylvania corrugated products plant we spent 2344 million   for capital investments in 2013 compared with 1285 million in 2012  in 2012 we received 574 million in grant proceeds from the us treasury 

financing activities 

2014   

in 2014  we used 3511 million  for financing activities while financing activities provided 7868 million  in 2013  in 2014  we made 5925 million  of principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases and received 3989 million  of proceeds net of debt discount from longterm debt issuances for a net reduction in debt of 1936 million to reduce exposure to variable interest rates in september 2014 we issued 400 million of tenyear notes with a fixed interest rate of 365 and used the proceeds to pay down a portion of our fiveyear variablerate term loan in october 2013 we entered into 235 billion of new credit facilities including a 3500 million  revolver which remains undrawn we used the proceeds from borrowings under these facilities and cash on hand to finance the acquisition of boise repay 9536 million of indebtedness which included 8298 million of acquired boise debt and for general corporate purposes in addition in 2013 we repaid 122 million of outstanding debt prior to the acquisition of boise and repaid 1090 million under our receivables credit facility that we terminated in december 2013 in 2014 we also paid 34 million of financing costs compared with 194 million in 2013  we paid 1574 million  of dividends in 2014  compared with 1091 million  of dividends and 78 million  of common stock repurchases in 2013  the lower dividends paid in 2013  resulted from accelerating the dividends that would have been paid in january 2013 to december 2012 during 2014  we withheld 183170 shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities of 132 million  compared with 110 million  in 2013  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from sharebased awards contributed 159 million in 2014  compared with 107 million in 2013

2013   

in 2013 financing activities provided 7868 million  while we used 2456 million  for financing activities in 2012 the change was due primarily to activities related to financing the acquisition of boise as described above we paid 1091 million of dividends and we repurchased 78 million of common stock in 2013 compared with 1178 million  of dividends paid and 452 million of common stock repurchases in 2012 the higher dividends paid in 2012 resulted from accelerating the dividends that would have been paid in january 2013 to december 2012 offset partially by increases in dividends during 2013 beginning in 2013 we began withholding shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities which amounted to 110 million in 2012 we also paid 655 million to settle treasury locks

the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december 31 2014  for the categories described below some of the amounts included in the table are based on managements estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table below any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities dollars in millions

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2014  

inflation and other general cost increases 

we are subject to both contractual inflation and other general cost increases if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases growth andor cost reductions in our operations these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect of our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

in 2014 our total company costs including cost of sales cos and selling general and administrative expenses sga was 51 billion  and excluding noncash costs depreciation pension and sharebased compensation expense was 47 billion  a 1 increase in cos and sga costs would increase costs by 51 million  and cash costs by 47 million  

certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber purchased energy and chemicals 

energy 

in 2014  our mills including both packaging and paper mills consumed about 88 million mmbtu’s of fuel including internally generated and externally purchased to produce both steam and electricity the following table for 2014 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year our mills represent about 90 of our total purchased fuel costs the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs 



 28 

in addition the mills purchased 2483  million ckwh hundred kilowatt hours of purchased electricity in 2014 the purchases by quarter and the average cost per ckwh were as follows 



environmental matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and waste disposal these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and waste disposal the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we spent 439 million 411 million and 258 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal superfund law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these liabilities could be significant however officemax may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification 

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the epa established a three year deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers states are authorized to extend the deadline an additional year if they so elect pca is currently assessing the impact of these regulations which are expected to require modifications to or replacement of certain of pca’s boilers pca currently estimates that compliance with the final rule will require capital expenditures of up to 16 million in 2015 due to the complexity of these regulations and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations this estimate is subject to further revisions we currently expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 50 million in 2015 total capital expenditures for environmental matters were 290 million in 2014  62 million in 2013  and 18 million for 2012 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca 

 29 

could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2014 remediation costs at pca’s mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million  and the acquired boise locations have not incurred any significant remediation costs since boise incs inception in 2008 as of december 31 2014  we maintained an environmental reserve of 354 million  relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 354 million  accrued at december 31 2014  will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

pensions 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases longevity and service lives of participants expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 11  employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits  

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2014  we had approximately 1261 million  of actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees which is between seven to ten years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense 

 30 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 



a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2014  and 2015  pension expense dollars in millions

goodwill and intangible asset impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2014  we had 5468 million  of goodwill of which we recorded 4586 million  in connection with the acquisition of boise in fourth quarter 2013 at december 31 2014  we had   4916 million  and 552 million   of goodwill recorded in our packaging and paper segments respectively all of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we maintain two reporting units for purposes of our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing packaging and paper which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 18  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

in conducting our goodwill impairment analysis we utilize the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model level 3 measurement the fair value was also calculated using the market approach based primarily on comparable company ebitda multiples level 2 measurement and was compared to and supported the fair value based upon the discounted cash flow approach we believe that the discounted cash flow model captures our estimates regarding the results of our future prospects however we also considered the markets expectations based on observable market information the 

 31 

discounted cash flow model estimates the projected future cash flows to be generated by our reporting units discounted to present value using a discount rate for a potential market participant the market approach estimates fair value based on multiples of ebitda the following assumptions are key to our estimates of fair value 

business projections the discounted cash flow model utilizes business projections that are developed internally by management for use in managing the business these projections include significant assumptions such as estimates of future revenues profits income taxes and capital expenditures our forecasts take into consideration recent sales data for existing products planned timing of capital projects and key economic indicators to estimate future production volumes selling prices and key input costs for our manufactured products our pricing assumptions are estimated based upon an assessment of industry supply and demand dynamics for our major products 

growth rates a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow model the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings or revenue is projected to grow beyond the forecast period 

discount rates future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise the discount rates selected are based on existing conditions within our industry and reflect adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt 

ebitda multiples  the market approach requires the use of a valuation multiple to calculate the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we use an ebitda multiple based on a selection of comparable companies and recent acquisition transactions within our industries 

based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our packaging and paper reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying amount and therefore no goodwill impairment existed as a result the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required to be completed 

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill and intangible assets as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

longlived asset impairment 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement   

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing 

 32 

from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized 420 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to shortening the useful lives of assets at the deridder louisiana mill which primarily related to the newsprint business we exited in 2014 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes and separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense and our tax basis in assets and liabilities 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities we also recognize only the impact of tax positions that based on their technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex us and foreign tax regulations exposures from not filing in some jurisdictions and transfer pricing exposures from allocation of income between jurisdictions it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate uncertain tax positions because we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts 

income from operations and net income excluding special items are nongaap financial measures management excludes special items and uses nongaap measures to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such reconciliations of the nongaap measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  follow in millions except per share amounts 



 

 in first quarter 2012 pca amended its 2009 tax return to reduce the gallons claimed as cellulosic biofuel producer credits previously recorded as a tax benefit and increase the gallons claimed for alternative energy tax credits previously recorded as income the increase in gallons claimed as alternative energy tax credits resulted in income of 955 million and the decrease in gallons claimed as cellulosic biofuel producer credits resulted in a decrease in tax benefits of 1185 million or a net charge of 230 million

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2014  the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2014  

during the quarter ended december 31 2014  there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014  based on the specified criteria

below is a map of our locations following the acquisition 

packaging 

packaging products 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of packaging for meat fresh fruit and vegetables processed food beverages and other industrial and consumer products 

during the year ended december 31 2013  our packaging segment produced 27 million tons of containerboard at our mills our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 384 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 37 billion in 2013  

after the acquisition of boise we are also a producer of newsprint with one machine located at our deridder louisiana mill we sell primarily to newspaper publishers in the southern and southwestern united states newsprint operations are reported in the packaging segment 

facilities 

we manufacture our packaging products at five   containerboard mills one containerboard machine at our wallula washington white paper mill corrugated manufacturing operations protective packaging operations and one newsprint machine the following paragraphs describe the mills at which we produce containerboard 

 2 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest kraft linerboard mills in the united states its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association “afpa” was 1065000 tons in 2013  the mill produced 1063000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines the mill can produce a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

deridder    we acquired the deridder louisiana mill in the acquisition of boise it is a mill that produces both linerboard and newsprint on two paper machines its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 610000 tons of linerboard and 230000 tons of newsprint during the twelve months of 2013  it produced 607000 tons of linerboard and 230000 tons of newsprint deridders linerboard machine can produce a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 69 lb 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 560000 tons in 2013  our single paper machine at valdosta produced 557000 tons of kraft linerboard the mill can produce a range of basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest semichemical corrugating medium mills in the united states its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa was 550000 tons in 2013  the mill produced 547000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines the tomahawk mill can produce a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity on three paper machines as reported to the afpa was 445000 tons in 2013  the mill produced 441000 tons of corrugating medium on three paper machines at filer city filer city can produce corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb to 47 lb 

wallula    we acquired the wallula washington mill with the acquisition of boise it is primarily a white paper mill but also produces corrugating medium on one of its paper machines its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity of medium as reported to the afpa was 140000 tons during the twelve months of 2013  the mill produced 139000 tons of corrugating medium wallula can produce corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb to 38 lb 

we operate 98 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center eight regional design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 98 manufacturing facilities 64 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers 33 are sheet plants which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated containers and one is a corrugated sheetonly manufacturer 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 32 states in the us we also have converting operations outside of the continental us including three facilities in europe two in mexico and one in canada 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 570 companies and 1240 plants each of our plants serve a market radius of around 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost to manufacture containerboard we consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than the valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements  if we had we owned boise for the full year we would have been a net recycled fiber buyer of less than 15 of our packaging mills fiber requirements 

 3 

we procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights longterm supply agreements and market purchases we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000 acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 10 years remaining on average 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative sfi and we are certified under the sfi sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources we are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

energy supply energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and purchased wood waste coal and oil each of our mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2013 our packaging mills including boise mills for the full year as if we had acquired boise on january 1 2013 consumed about 62 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 62   million mmbtu’s consumed about 64 was from mill generated byproducts and 36 was from purchased fuels of the 36 in purchased fuels 39 was from purchased wood waste 33 was from natural gas and 20 was from coal 

sales marketing and distribution 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization independent brokers and distribution partners we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium sales to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to export customers this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments typically represent approximately 60 of the tons shipped and the remaining 40 is comprised of truck shipments our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150 miles radius we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

customers 

we sell corrugated products to over 15000 customers in over 25000 locations about twothirds of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onethird of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants no single customer exceeds 10 of segment sales

the primary enduse markets in the united states for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2012 fibre box association annual report 



competition 

as of december 31 2013  we believe we are the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states according to industry sources and our own estimates according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 570 us companies operating approximately 1240 plants the primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality service price product design and innovation most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region competition in our corrugated product operations tends to be regional although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence and competition varies based on each type of corrugated container we sell 

on a national level our primary competitors are international paper company rocktenn company and georgiapacific llc however with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

paper 

our paper segment operating under the trade name boise paper a division of packaging corporation of america was acquired with the acquisition of boise inc on october 25 2013  we manufacture and sell white papers including both commodity and specialty papers which may have custom or specialized features such as colors coatings high brightness and recycled content white papers consist of communication papers cutsize office papers and printing and converting papers and pressure sensitive papers including release liners which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commerciallypackaged products we are the third largest manufacturer of white papers in north america according to industry sources and our own estimates the paper segment also produces market pulp on one paper machine at our wallula washington mill which is sold to outside customers to produce paper products 

facilities 

we have three white paper mills located in the united states the following paragraphs describe our white paper mills 

jackson     our jackson alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines as reported to the afpa was 480000 tons the mill produced 497000 tons of white papers during the twelve months of 2013 on a converted basis from rollstock to cutsize white papers the mill produced 427000 tons in 2013 

international falls     our international falls minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines as reported to the afpa was 425000 tons the mill produced 523000 tons of white papers during the twelve months of 2013  in october 2013 two machines were shut down which reduced annual capacity by 115000 tons on a converted basis from rollstock to cutsize white papers the mill produced 325000 tons in 2013 

wallula    our wallula washington mill has the ability on one machine to switch production between pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades the mill also produces corrugating medium and market pulp its yearend 2013  annual estimated production capacity of white paper grades and market pulp as reported to the afpa was 190000 tons and 120000 tons respectively the corrugating medium produced at wallula is included in our packaging segment as discussed above the mill produced 192000 tons of white papers and 102000 tons of market pulp in 2013

major raw materials used 

fiber supply   fiber is our principal raw material in this segment including wood fiber recycled fiber and purchased pulp we purchase both whole logs and wood chips which are a byproduct of lumber and plywood production at our mill in jackson alabama we also purchase recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers our jackson and international falls paper mills also purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual arrangements we negotiate these arrangements periodically and terms can fluctuate based on prevailing pulp market conditions including pricing and supply dynamics 

we purchase wood fiber through contracts and openmarket purchases our contracts are generally with suppliers located in close proximity to the specific facility they supply and they commonly contain price adjustment mechanisms to account for market price and expense volatility 

we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative sfi and the forest stewardship council fsc and are certified under the sfi sourcing standards we procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the sfi and fsc standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources 

energy supply our white paper business consumes substantial amounts of energy obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include natural gas electricity byproducts of the manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and purchased wood waste each of the paper mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

for the full year 2013 as if pca had acquired boise on january 1 2013 the white paper mills consumed about 315 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 315 million mmbtu’s consumed about 63 was from mill generated byproducts and 37 was from purchased fuels of the 37 in purchased fuels 73 was from natural gas and 27 from purchased wood waste 

chemical supply     we consume a significant amount of chemicals in the production of white papers including starch caustic soda sodium chlorate precipitated calcium carbonate dyestuffs and optical brighteners most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts which contain price adjustment mechanisms designed to provide greater pricing stability than openmarket purchases these contracts are negotiated periodically at prevailing rates 

sales marketing and distribution 

our white papers are sold primarily by our own sales personnel we ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck this allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements rail shipments typically represent approximately 70 of the tons shipped and the remaining 30 is comprised of truck shipments 

customers 

we have over 600 paper customers including paper merchants commercial and financial printers paper converters such as envelope and form manufacturers and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels we have established longterm relationships with many of our customers officemax is our paper segments largest customer in november 2013 officemax merged with its competitor office depot we have an agreement with officemax in which we will supply at least 80 of officemaxs requirements for commodity office papers through december 2017 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017 if this were to occur officemaxs purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years our agreement with officemax survived the merger with respect to the office paper requirements of the legacy officemax business for the period of october 25 2013 through december 31 2013 our sales to office depot including officemax our largest paper segment customer represented 38  of our paper segment sales revenue 

competition 

the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive commodity grades of white paper are globally traded with numerous worldwide manufacturers and as a result these products compete primarily on the basis of price all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and although we compete primarily in

the domestic market we do face competition from foreign producers the level of this competition varies depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates in general paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas except in highly specialized or custom grades 

our largest competitors include domtar corporation international paper company and georgiapacific llc although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades quality and service are important competitive determinants our white papers compete with electronic data transmission ereaders electronic document storage alternatives and paper grades we do not produce increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage in response to lower demand two machines were shut down at our international falls minnesota mill in october 2013

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in our other filings with the 

 8 

securities and exchange commission sec the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forwardlooking statement 

industry risks 

industry cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity   macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity create changes in prices sales volumes and margins for most of our products particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products 

prices for all of our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in our industry and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which are often volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations additionally market conditions beyond our control can affect the prices for our commodity products our ability to achieve acceptable operating performance and margins depends primarily upon managing our cost structure and general operating conditions if the prices for our products decline or if we are unable to control our costs it could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows profitability and liquidity 

competition  the intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations our industries are highly competitive with no single containerboard corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our packaging products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

several of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources greater manufacturing economies of scale greater energy self sufficiency or lower operating costs compared with our company we may be unable to compete with these companies particularly during economic downturns some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors including overseas producers into the markets we serve our competitors pricing strategies our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our inability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities 

company risks 

cost of fiber  an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather general logging conditions and geography 

the availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products we purchase recycled fiber for use at seven of our eight mills in 2013 including boises operations as if we had acquired boise on january 1 2013 we would have purchased approximately 480000 tons of recycled fiber net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals  an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings we have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage or make more expensive the use of certain fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing also fluctuate these 

 9 

fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events including 

 

these events could harm our ability to serve our customers and lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters  pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations including new us environmental protection agency rules relating to industrial boiler emissions known as the boiler mact rules are expected to require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

customer concentration  officemax represents a significant portion of pca’s paper business we have a supply agreement with officemax our largest customer in the paper segment the agreement requires officemax to buy and us to supply at least 80 of officemax’s requirements for office papers through december 2017 however there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017 in november 2013 officemax merged with office depot our agreement with officemax provides that it survives the merger with respect to the office paper requirements of the legacy officemax business we cannot predict how the merger will affect the financial condition of the combined company the paper requirements of the legacy officemax business or the effects on the pricing and competition for office papers in 2013 for the period of october 25 2013 to december 31 2013 our sales revenue to office depot including officemax accounted for 38  of paper segment sales significant reductions in paper purchases from the postmerger entity would cause our paper business to attempt to expand its customer base and could potentially decrease its profitability if new customer sales required either a decrease in its pricing andor an increase in its cost of sales any significant deterioration in the financial condition of the postmerger entity affecting the ability to pay or causing a significant change in the willingness to continue to purchase our products could harm our business and results of operations 

acquisition integration  the acquired businesses of boise may underperform relative to our expectations and we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses the acquired businesses of boise may underperform relative to our expectations which may cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations if the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations or if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

cyber security  risks related to security breaches of company customer employee and vendor information as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes could adversely affect our business   we rely on 

 10 

various information technology systems to capture process store and report data and interact with customers vendors and employees despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and internal and independent thirdparty assessments our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches network system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents delayed sales slowed production or other repercussions resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or cash flows 

risks related to economic financial and investment risk 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations we increased our indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of boise from 8076 million including capital leases as of september 30 2013 to approximately 25727 million at december 31 2013 we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future the increase in indebtedness from the acquisition of boise plus any future borrowings may affect our future operations including without limitation 

 

further if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing investments 

market price of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

general economic conditions  adverse business and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position  general global economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods employment levels the availability and cost of credit and ultimately the profitability of our business high unemployment rates lower family income lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business results of operations liquidity and financial position

executive summary 

in 2013 sales grew 289 to a record 36653 million we reported 4363 million of net income or 447 per diluted share in 2013 compared with 1638 million or 168 per share in 2012 excluding special items we recorded 3202 million of net income or a record 328 per diluted share in 2013 compared with 2008 million and 206 per diluted share in 2012 in 2013 income included 874 million of income from special items including 1660 million from the reversal of previously established tax reserves partially offset by 678 million of pretax costs primarily related to the acquisition of boise on october 25 2013 and 109 million of pension plan curtailment charges excluding these special items the increase in earnings was driven by improvement in pcas earnings and two months and five days of results from the acquisition of boise operations pcas earnings improvement related primarily to increased pricing and higher demand partially offset by higher costs for labor and benefits energy fiber repairs freight and interest expense 

earnings per diluted share excluding special items in 2013 and 2012 were as follows

management excludes special items and uses nongaap measures to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliation of diluted eps to diluted eps excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other nongaap measures used in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included later in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

markets 

the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the us economy the u s economy continued to slowly improve in 2013 with an annual basis real gdp increase of 19 compared with a 28 increase in 2012 as reported by the us department of commerce trade publications reported that industrywide corrugated products shipments were unchanged in 2013 compared to 2012 and containerboard production was 12 higher than 2012 in 2013 pca’s corrugated products shipments increased 57 excluding boise shipments and increased 107 including boise shipments during the partial fourth quarter pca containerboard production for 2013 was 2607000 tons excluding boise compared to 2600000 tons in 2012 including pca’s ownership of boise during the partial quarter pca’s containerboard production was 2749000 tons in 2013 

the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives increasing shifts to these alternatives have had an adverse effect on traditional print media and usage of communication papers according to the american forest  paper association afpa us industry uncoated freesheet shipments declined 19 in 2013 compared to 2012 

outlook 

in the first quarter of 2014 we expect earnings to benefit compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 from a full quarter of boises results including synergies and lower amortization of annual mill outage costs our largest containerboard mill in counce tennessee will be down in march for its annual maintenance outage which will reduce production and increase operating costs we also expect higher energy costs across the company with colder weather in addition our mills were impacted by extreme cold and significant snowfalls in january and february resulting in higher than normal cost increases for energy wood and transportation costs at our converting plants were also impacted and we did have some plant closures as a result of weather labor and benefit costs are expected to be higher in the first quarter with annual wage increases and timing related benefit payments and we expect a higher tax rate considering all of these items we expect first quarter earnings excluding special items to be comparable to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings excluding special items

net sales 

net sales increased 2238 million or 85 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the year ended december 31 2011 net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes 2148 million and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 90 million 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 66 to 347 billion square feet in 2012 compared to 325 billion square feet in 2011 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume also increased 66 in 2012 versus 2011 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year both 2012 and 2011 contained 251 workdays those days not falling on a weekend or holiday containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 60 to 482000 tons for the year ended december 31 2012 from 513000 tons in 2011

income from operations 

income from operations increased 1707 million or 626 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 as noted in note 6  alternative energy tax credits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k pca amended its 2009 federal income tax return to reallocate gallons from the cellulosic biofuel producer credits to the alternative fuel mixture credits as a result income from operations was increased by 955 million in 2012 with an offsetting amount recorded in tax expense of 1185 million excluding special items as detailed below under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” income from operations increased 714 million for full year 2012 this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes 507 million higher sales prices 90 million and lower costs for energy 265 million recycled fiber 186 million and chemicals 75 million these improvements were partially offset by increased costs for fringe benefits 119 million depreciation 115 million labor 112 million and transportation 73 million 

gross profit increased 977 million or 180 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the year ended december 31 2011 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 207 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2011 to 225 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to increased volume and prices and reduced costs described above 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 223 million or 86 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the year ended december 31 2011 primarily as a result of increased costs for salaries 114 million fringe benefits 38 million incentive compensation 34 million and depreciation 28 million 

other expense net increased 11 million or 99 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was primarily due to plant closure costs 08 million 

interest expense net and income taxes 

net interest expense increased 337 million or 1154 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 the higher interest expense included a 213 million premium paid as part of the july 2012 redemption of the company’s 575 notes due in 2013 and a 34 million charge from settling the company’s 2011 treasury lock prior to its maturity the remaining 90 million increase in interest expense was primarily a result of lower capitalized interest 63 million related primarily to the counce tennessee linerboard mill and valdosta georgia linerboard mill major energy projects and additional interest expense 21 million related to pca’s term loan of 1500 million borrowed in october 2011 

pca’s effective tax rate was 570 for the year ended december 31 2012 which included a 225 higher rate from amending our 2009 tax return in 2012 related to alternative energy tax credits as described in note 6  alternative energy tax credits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k   excluding the amendment the 2012 effective tax rate would have been 345 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 351 for the year ended december 31 2011 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the alternative energy tax credits in 2012 state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca had no material changes to its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits under asc 740 “income taxes” during 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we ended the year with 1910 million of cash and 3310 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service including voluntary payments of debt and declared common stock dividends which we expect to be able to fund from these sources 

we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as our debt or credit 

 23 

facilities become due we will need to repay extend or replace such facilities our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities investing activities and financing activities dollars in millions 



our foreign operations are not material to our financial position or results of operations at december 31 2013  we had 71 million  of cash and shortterm investments held in operations outside of the united states we indefinitely reinvest our earnings in operations outside the united states however if foreign earnings were repatriated at a future date we would need to accrue and pay taxes it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings because the actual tax liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing when the repatriation occurs 

operating activities 

in 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was 6082 million  compared with 4042 million  in 2012 an increase   of 2040 million  approximately 61 or 1236 million  of the increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the increase in income from our operations in 2013 which we discuss above under operating results and two months and five days of income included in 2013 from the newly acquired boise operations in addition we used an additional 72 million of alternative energy tax credits to reduce federal income tax payments during 2013 compared with 2012 cash used for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions totaled 04 million  in 2013   compared with 808 million  in 2012 the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions in 2013 were driven primarily by higher accounts payable and lower inventory levels partially offset by lower accrued liabilities at december 31 2013  compared with december 31 2012  cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca’s operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 4042 million compared with 3455 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 587 million or 170 cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 4850 million for 2012 compared with 3661 million in 2011 an increase of 1189 million that was driven by the higher operating income in 2012 as previously discussed above under operating results and an additional 295 million of alternative energy tax credits used to reduce federal income tax payments during 2012 compared with 2011 cash used for operating assets and liabilities totaled 808 million in 2012 compared with 205 million in 2011 an increase of 603 million the additional requirements for operating assets and liabilities in 2012 were driven by reduced accounts payable levels in 2012 and higher levels of accounts receivable from higher sales volumes in 2012 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities in 2013 increased 13 billion  to 14 billion  compared with 1075 million  in 2012 in 2013 we paid 12 billion for the acquisition of boise net of 1217 million of cash acquired while in 2012 we spent 354 million  on the acquisition of a business we spent 2344 million   for capital investments in 2013 compared with 1285 million  in 2012  in 2012 we received 574 million in grant proceeds from the us treasury 

 24 

the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment excluding acquisitions by segment for the year ended december 31 2013  are included in the table below dollars in millions 



we expect capital investments in 2014 to be between 3800 million and 4000 million including capital required for synergies boiler mact spending and the deridder conversion project but excluding acquisitions if any   these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations as discussed below under environmental matters in 2014 of up to 31 million and we expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 4 million in 2014 our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and industrial boilers for additional information see environmental matters in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2013  pca had commitments for capital expenditures of   1514 million  pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 2427 million or 693 to 1075 million compared with the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was related to lower capital investments of 1517 million as our major energy projects were completed in 2011 the receipt of 574 million in grant proceeds from the us treasury in 2012 and lower cost of acquisitions of 219 million and lower additions to long term assets of 120 million during 2012 compared with 2011 

financing activities 

in 2013 financing activities provided 7868 million  while we used 2456 million  for financing activities in 2012 the change was due primarily to activities related to financing the acquisition of boise in october 2013 we entered into 235 billion  of new borrowings including a 3500 million  revolver which remains undrawn we used the proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand to finance the acquisition of boise repay 9536 million  of indebtedness which included 8298 million of acquired boise debt and for general corporate purposes in addition in 2013 we repaid 122 million of outstanding debt prior to the acquisition of boise and 1090 million that was outstanding under our receivables credit facility that we terminated and repaid in december 2013 in 2013 we also paid 194 million of financing costs we also paid 1091 million of dividends and we repurchased 78 million of common stock in 2013 compared with 1179 million of dividends paid and 452 million of common stock repurchases in 2012 the higher dividends paid in 2012 resulted from accelerating the dividends that would have been paid in january 2013 to december 2012 beginning in 2013 we began withholding shares from vesting equity awards to cover employee tax liabilities which amounted to 110 million in 2012 we also paid 655 million to settle treasury locks 

for more information about our debt commitments and treasury lock derivative instruments see note 8  debt  note 20  commitments guarantees indemnifications and legal proceedings  and note 11  derivative instruments and hedging activities  respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

 25 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 2456 million in 2012 compared with 356 million in 2011 an increase of 2100 million payments on longterm debt net of proceeds received were a use of cash of 401 million in 2012 compared with a source of cash of 1493 million in 2011 or a difference of 1894 million additionally pca paid an additional 754 million to settle treasury locks in 2012 compared with 2011 also in 2012 the company paid higher dividends of 418 million including the 245 million of dividends that would have been paid in january of 2013 but were accelerated to december of 2012 this was partially offset by lower repurchases of pca common stock of 799 million and higher proceeds received from stock option exercises of 157 million during 2012 compared with 2011 

on june 26 2012 pca issued 4000 million of 390 senior notes due june 15 2022 through a registered public offering pca used the proceeds from the offering together with cash on hand to redeem its 4000 million of 575 senior notes due august 1 2013 on july 26 2012 in connection with the redemption pca paid a redemption premium of 213 million and 112 million of accrued and unpaid interest

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2013  

environmental matters 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ processes in the  manufacture of containerboard paper and pulp which result in various discharges emissions and wastes these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations we operate and expect to continue to operate under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges emissions and wastes the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we spent 411 million 258 million and 260 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil  or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations in addition officemax now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of office depot retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses facilities and assets we acquired from boise generally this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004 some of these 

 28 

liabilities could be significant however officemax may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations and in some cases we may not be entitled to such indemnification 

in january 2013 the us environmental protection agency the epa established a three year deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers states are authorized to extend the deadline an additional year if they so elect pca is currently assessing the impact of these regulations which are expected to require modifications to or replacement of certain of pca’s boilers pca currently estimates that compliance with the final rule will require capital expenditures between 38 million and 42 million over the next three years due to the complexity of these regulations and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations this estimate is subject to further revisions we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations in 2014 of up to 31 million and expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 4 million in 2014 total capital expenditures for environmental matters were 99 million for 2013 as if boise had been combined with us on january 1 2013 and 18 million and 28 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2013 remediation costs at pca’s mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million and the acquired boise locations have not incurred any significant remediation costs since their inception in 2008 as of december 31 2013  we maintained an environmental reserve of 341 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects as of this filing the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 341 million accrued at december 31 2013  will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently selfgenerate a significant portion of our power requirements at our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to business combinations goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits environmental liabilities income taxes and longlived asset impairment among others pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results these estimates require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

business combinations 

from time to time we may enter into material business combinations we allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition 

 29 

including the fair values fair value is determined using the income approach cost approach and or market approach of inventory property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions among others this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations additionally we expense any acquisitionrelated costs as incurred in connection with each business combination 

significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased 

goodwill and intangible asset impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at december 31 2013  we had 5268 million  of goodwill of which we recorded 4586 million  in connection with the acquisition of boise in fourth quarter 2013 at december 31 2013  we had 4729 million  and 539 million   of goodwill recorded in our packaging and paper segments respectively all of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary based on the results of the goodwill impairment test we concluded that no goodwill impairment existed 

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill and intangible assets as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

pensions 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 715 “compensation  retirement benefits” the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts including discount rates expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increases retirement rates mortality rates expected contributions and other factors the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 10  employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits  

we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 31 2013  we had approximately 363 million  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax on our consolidated balance sheet accumulated losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of assets will be recognized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active employees which is between seven to ten years to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense 

 30 

we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as discussed above the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates retirement rates investment performance and funding decisions among other factors the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods dollars in millions 



a change of 025 in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2013  and 2014  pension expense dollars in millions 



 

 

for more information related to our pensions benefits including the general nature of the plans deferred gains and losses funding obligations and cash flows see note 10  employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes and separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense and our tax basis in assets and liabilities 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities we also recognize only the impact of tax positions that based on their technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority 

 31 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex us and foreign tax regulations exposures from not filing in some jurisdictions and transfer pricing exposures from allocation of income between jurisdictions it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate uncertain tax positions because we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

longlived asset impairment 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value longlived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is susceptible to change from period to period 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable for purposes of testing for impairment we group our longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the longlived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those longlived assets in producing net cash flows asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular longlived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes to measure future cash flows we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes future product pricing and future expenses to be incurred in addition estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber environmental requirements capital spending and other strategic management decisions we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly level 1 measurement or indirectly the amount for which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party when available level 2 measurement when quoted market prices are not available we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value level 3 measurement   

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets changes in circumstances such as changes to our operational or capital strategy changes in regulation or technological advances may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

on october 25 2013 pca acquired boise inc boise pca is in the process of integrating boise into its operations pca is analyzing evaluating and where necessary will implement changes in controls and procedures relating to the boise business as such integration proceeds as a result this process may result in additions or changes to pcas internal control over financial reporting except as it relates to the acquisition of boise there was no change in pcas internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect pcas internal control over financial reporting 

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2013  the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report but excluded the operations acquired from boise based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2013  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013  based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment and excluding the operations acquired from boise pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013  based on the specified criteria

 item 1 business tableend general 

packaging corporation of america “we” “us” “our” “pca” or the “company” is the fourth largest producer of containerboard in the united states in terms of production capacity during 2012 we produced 26 million tons of containerboard at our mills of which about 83 was consumed in pca’s corrugated products manufacturing plants 10 was sold in the export market and 7 was sold to domestic customers our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 347 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 28 billion in 2012 

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

 

 in 2012 we produced 16 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 10 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

industry overview 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2011 fibre box association annual report 

 

 corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 570 companies and 1240 plants 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated 

  

products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations in corrugated products plants kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required and shipped to converters 

pca operations and products 

containerboard mills 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 20 lb to 47 lb mill capacities described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper basis weights and production can exceed estimated capacity if a higherthanestimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

the following four paragraphs describe our containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum capacity 2012 actual production and production capabilities 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest kraft linerboard mills in the united states its yearend 2012 annual estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association “afpa” is 1057000 tons in 2012 we produced 1056000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce the mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill its yearend 2012 annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa is 559000 tons in 2012 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 561000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces a range of basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest semichemical corrugating medium mills in the united states its yearend 2012 annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa is 545000 tons in 2012 we produced 543000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at tomahawk the tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill its yearend 2012 annual estimated production capacity on three paper machines as reported to the afpa is 439000 tons in 2012 we produced 440000 tons of corrugating medium on three paper machines at filer city filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb to 47 lb 

corrugated products 

we operate 71 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center seven regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 71 manufacturing facilities 41 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 30 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated containers 

  

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugated plant for the most part serves a market radius of around 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000 acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 11 years remaining on average in addition we have in place supply agreements covering approximately 318000 acres with the majority of the acreage covered by the supply agreements located in close proximity to our counce mill 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative sfi and is certified under the sfi sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources pca is committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the graphic design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

distribution 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments typically represent from 50 to 55 of the tons shipped and the remaining 45 to 50 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities 

our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

  

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to approximately 9500 customers in over 18000 locations about twothirds of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onethird consists primarily of national accounts who have multiple locations and are served by a number of pca plants 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than our valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2012 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 564000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 197000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 367000 tons or 14 of pca’s total mill fiber requirements 

energy supply energy at pca’s four mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste and natural gas purchased wood waste coal and oil each of pca’s mills selfgenerates process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2012 pca’s four mills consumed about 47 million mmbtu’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity of the 47 million mmbtu’s consumed about 68 was from mill generated byproducts and 32 was from purchased fuels of the 32 in purchased fuels 52 was from natural gas 26 from purchased wood waste and 15 was from coal 

in 2012 our mills purchased approximately 76 million ckwh hundred kilowatt hours of electricity or the equivalent of 26 million mmbtu’s approximately 55 of the electricity consumed by our four mills in 2012 was generated onsite 

in 2012 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed about 20 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

competition 

according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 570 us companies operating approximately 1240 plants most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers 

  

of other types of packaging products on a national level our primary competitors include international paper company georgiapacific owned by koch industries inc and rocktenn company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company georgiapacific and rocktenn company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 8600 employees approximately 2600 of these employees were salaried and approximately 6000 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

based on an agreement reached with the usw in 2008 the existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering uswrepresented employees 91 of mill hourly workforce were extended five years with this extension the usw contracts at our mills are currently set to expire between september 2013 and june 2015 agreements with other union mill employees 9 of mill hourly workforce expire between october 2014 and june 2017 based on an agreement reached with the usw in 2009 the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering usw represented employees was extended up to five years contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between november 2012 and march 2018 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

during 2012 we experienced no work stoppages and have experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the ten years prior to 2012 we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

2 clean water act cwa 

3 clean air act caa 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we spent 258 million 260 million and 246 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future 

  

environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition for a further discussion of the financial impact of our compliance with environmental laws please see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental matters”

financial information about segments 

we operate as one segment and our revenues are generated primarily in one geographic segment see “segment information” of note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies contained in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 




 item 1a risk factors 

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity earnings expenditures and financial condition these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

industry risks 

industry cyclicality — imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and corrugated products and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard and corrugated products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations 

  

competition — the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations 

the containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

company risks 

cost of fiber — an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings 

pca has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills on approximately 318000 acres of timberland in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability source and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber the cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather and general logging conditions 

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants 350000 to 450000 tons of recycled fiber per year the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber 

the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals — an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past new and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage or make more expensive the use of certain fuels in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing also fluctuate these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

  

material disruption of manufacturing — a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a number of events including unscheduled maintenance outages prolonged power failures an equipment failure fire explosion of a boiler labor difficulties natural catastrophes terrorism governmental regulations and other operational problems these events could cause us to be unable to service our customers and lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters — pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years new and more stringent environmental regulations including new us environmental protection agency rules relating to industrial boiler emissions known as the boiler mact rules are expected to require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

investment risks 

market price of our common stock — the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline 

securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

general risks 

economic conditions — our earnings and cash generated from operations could be lower if the economy weakens 

our operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the us economy and to a lesser extent by global economic conditions a weakening in the economy could reduce the demand for our products and ultimately lower our earnings and cash flows lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend during september and october 2010 pca and eight other us and canadian containerboard producers were named as defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging violations of the sherman act the lawsuits have been consolidated in a single complaint under the caption kleen products llc v packaging corp of america et al the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to limit the supply of containerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of containerboard products during the period from august 2005 to the time of filing of the complaint the complaint was filed as a purported class action suit on behalf of all purchasers of containerboard products during such period the complaint seeks treble damages and costs including attorney’s fees the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint were denied by the court in april 2011 pca believes the allegations are without merit and will defend this lawsuit vigorously however as the lawsuit is in the document production phase of discovery pca is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses 

pca is a party to various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

pca is the fourth largest producer of containerboard in the united states based on production capacity we operate four containerboard mills and 71 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the united states approximately 83 of the containerboard tons produced at our mills is consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants the remaining 17 is sold to domestic customers or the export market we produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging 

in analyzing our operating performance we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results 

 

  

   

  

 historically supply and demand as well as industrywide inventory levels have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products in addition to us shipments approximately 10 of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries 

the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the us economy the us economy improved modestly in 2012 as real gdp increased 22 compared to a 18 increase in 2011 as reported by the u s department of commerce trade publications reported that industrywide corrugated products shipments increased 02 in 2012 compared to 2011 and containerboard production was 06 higher than in 2011 pca benefitted from improved demand that exceeded the industry average as well as the acquisition of four corrugated products plants made during 2011 and 2012 and for the year our corrugated products shipments were up 66 compared to 2011 pca also set a new record for annual production at its mills with containerboard production increasing by 40 from 2499000 tons in 2011 to 2600000 tons in 2012 trade publications reported that industry containerboard inventories at the end of december 2012 were 218 million tons the second lowest yearending level since 1980 

average prices for containerboard and corrugated products were higher during 2012 compared to 2011 published containerboard prices increased by 50 per ton in september 2012 

increased pricing and higher demand along with lower costs for energy and recycled fiber improved pca’s 2012 earnings compared to 2011 however these positive factors were partially offset by higher costs for labor and benefits transportation depreciation and interest expense energy costs were lower reflecting the benefits of our completed major energy projects as well as lower prices paid for purchased fuels and electricity which decreased approximately 10 in 2012 compared to the 2011 average published recycled fiber costs decreased in 2012 on average approximately 30 compared to 2011 wood fiber costs in 2012 were essentially unchanged from 2011 levels transportation costs increased 3 from prior year levels as average diesel prices as reported by the us department of energy increased 3 from the 2011 average price labor related costs increased reflecting annual merit increases and higher costs for medical insurance pensions and incentives 

special items impacting 2012 earnings included a net charges of 196 million or 021 per share relating to alternative energy tax credits described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements b charges of 160 million or 016 per share from the company’s debt refinancing completed in july 2012 and c charges of 14 million or 001 per share from plant closures excluding these special items pca earned net income of 2007 million 206 per diluted share for the full year 2012 this compares with 1618 million 161 per diluted share for 2011 which excludes charges of 48 million or 005 per share from asset disposals related to major energy projects and 10 million of income or 001 per share from an adjustment related to medical benefits reserves management excludes these special items and uses nongaap measures to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliations of nongaap measures used in this item 7 to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included elsewhere in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” 

in the first quarter of 2013 our containerboard production should be lower and operating costs higher compared to the fourth quarter with two less mill production days and mill annual maintenance downtime we also expect higher energy costs with colder weather and a pattern of extremely wet weather put pressure on wood costs and availability in the us south during january corrugated products volume will be seasonally lower and we expect higher costs for recycled fiber and labor and benefits these items will be partially offset 

  

by higher average corrugated products prices with a full quarter’s realization of fourth quarter price increases considering all of these items we expect first quarter earnings to be lower than fourth quarter 2012 earnings excluding special items of 061 per diluted share 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 are set forth below 

 

 net sales 

net sales increased by 2238 million or 85 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the year ended december 31 2011 net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes 2148 million and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 90 million 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 66 to 347 billion square feet in 2012 compared to 325 billion square feet in 2011 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume also increased 66 in 2012 versus 2011 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year both 2012 and 2011 contained 251 workdays those days not falling on a weekend or holiday containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 60 to 482000 tons for the year ended december 31 2012 from 513000 tons in 2011 

income from operations 

income from operations increased by 1707 million or 626 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 as noted in note 15 — alternative energy tax credits to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” pca amended its 2009 federal income tax return to reallocate gallons from the cellulosic biofuel producer credits to the alternative fuel mixture credits as a result income from operations was increased by 955 million in 2012 with an offsetting amount recorded in tax expense of 1185 million excluding special items as detailed below under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” income from operations increased 714 million for full year 2012 this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes 507 million higher sales prices 90 million and lower costs for energy 265 million recycled fiber 186 million and chemicals 75 million these improvements were partially offset by increased costs for fringe benefits 119 million depreciation 115 million labor 112 million and transportation 73 million 

gross profit increased 977 million or 180 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the year ended december 31 2011 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 207 of net sales in the year ended 

  

december 31 2011 to 225 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to increased volume and prices and reduced costs described above 

selling and administrative expenses increased 168 million or 87 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the year ended december 31 2011 primarily as a result of increased costs for salaries 83 million depreciation 33 million fringe benefits 30 million and incentive compensation 25 million 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 46 million or 71 from the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefits expense 38 million and higher depreciation 06 million 

other expense net increased 11 million or 99 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was primarily due to increased fixed asset disposal costs 11 million 

interest expense net and income taxes 

net interest expense increased 337 million or 1154 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the higher interest expense included a 213 million premium paid as part of the july 2012 redemption of the company’s 575 notes due in 2013 see note 8—debt contained in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” and a 34 million charge from settling the company’s 2011 treasury lock prior to its maturity see note 9—derivative instruments and hedging activities contained in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” the remaining 90 million increase in interest expense was primarily a result of lower capitalized interest 63 million related primarily to the counce tennessee linerboard mill and valdosta georgia linerboard mill major energy projects and additional interest expense 21 million related to pca’s term loan of 1500 million borrowed in october 2011 

pca’s effective tax rate was 570 for the year ended december 31 2012 which included a 225 higher rate from amending our 2009 tax return in 2012 related to alternative energy tax credits as described in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements excluding the amendment the 2012 effective tax rate would have been 345 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 351 for the year ended december 31 2011 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the alternative energy tax credits in 2012 state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca had no material changes to its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits under asc 740 “income taxes” during 2012 but does expect a significant change within the next twelve months as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 are set forth below 

 

   

net sales

income from operations 

income from operations increased by 873 million or 471 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 2010 as noted in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements our 2010 income from operations was reduced primarily due to reversing a portion of our 2009 alternative fuel mixture credits out of income from operations 960 million in order to claim cellulosic biofuel credits which were recorded in the provision for income taxes 1355 million in 2010 in addition income from operations included alternative fuel mixture credits in the amount of 92 million in 2010 excluding special items as detailed below under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” income from operations decreased 68 million for full year 2011 this decrease was primarily attributable to increased costs for transportation 205 million chemicals 167 million labor 134 million recycled fiber 100 million medical and workers’ compensation 89 million depreciation 81 million energy 48 million the impact of severe winter weather in first quarter 2011 35 million legal services 23 million travel entertainment and meetings 19 million warehousing requirements 17 million building repairs 15 million environmental expenses 14 million and other fringe benefits 12 million these increases were partially offset by increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 619 million and higher sales volume 294 million

selling and administrative expenses increased 115 million or 63 for the year ended december 31 2011 from the year ended december 31 2010 primarily as a result of increased salary expense 43 million reflecting annual merit increases fringe benefits 13 million warehouse costs related to customer requirements 17 million travel and meeting costs 16 million and other increased costs which were individually insignificant 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 64 million or 111 from the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses 40 million and increased costs for professional services related to legal matters 23 million 

other expense net decreased 92 million or 463 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease was primarily due to closure costs at two facilities 42 million and costs related to the writeoff of paper machine assets at tomahawk 28 million in 2010 in addition to reduced fixed asset disposal costs 16 million 

  

interest expense net and income taxes 

net interest expense decreased by 31 million or 96 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest 22 million related to the counce and valdosta major energy projects 

pca’s effective tax rate was 351 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 342 for the year ended december 31 2010 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the alternative energy tax credits in 2010 state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca recorded a material change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits under asc 740 “income taxes” of 1020 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the amendment of the 2009 federal income tax return to claim gallons of alternative fuels produced at the filer city michigan mill due to the proprietary nature of the biofuel process at the filer city mill uncertainty as to total fuel gallons qualifying for the credit exists which caused the additional reserve 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 4042 million compared to 3455 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 587 million or 170 cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 4850 million for 2012 compared to 3661 million for 2011 an increase of 1189 million that was driven by the stronger operations in 2012 as previously discussed and an additional 295 million of alternative energy tax credits used to reduce federal income tax payments during 2012 compared to 2011 cash used for operating assets and liabilities totaled 808 million in 2012 compared to 205 million in 2011 an increase of 603 million the additional requirements for operating assets and liabilities in 2012 were driven by reduced accounts payable levels in 2012 and higher levels of accounts receivable from higher sales volumes in 2012 cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca’s operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 3455 million compared to 3499 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a decrease of 44 million or 13 cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 3661 million for 2011 compared to 3959 million for 2010 a decrease of 298 million that was driven by 327 million in fewer alternative energy tax credits used to reduce federal income tax payments during 2011 compared to 2010 cash used for operating assets and liabilities totaled 205 million in 2011 compared to 459 million in 2010 a decrease of 254 million the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities in 2011 were driven by an improvement in accounts receivable resulting from price increases in 2010 and favorable changes in inventory in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a 2010 build in inventory in anticipation of the downtime related to the major energy project work completed in 2011 partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable 

  

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 2427 million or 693 to 1075 million compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was related to lower additions to property plant and equipment of 1517 million as our major energy projects were completed in 2011 the receipt of 574 million in grant proceeds from the us treasury in 2012 see note 19 — us treasury grant in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” and lower cost of acquisitions of 219 million and lower additions to long term assets of 120 million during 2012 compared to 2011 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 3501 million an increase of 288 million or 90 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily related to 573 million in corrugated products business acquisitions completed in 2011 and higher additions to other longterm assets of 104 million in 2011 compared to 2010 this was partially offset by lower additions to property plant and equipment of 400 million during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to reduced spending 559 million on the major energy projects 

as of december 31 2012 pca had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of 270 million pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 2456 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 356 million for the same period in 2011 an increase of 2100 million payments on longterm debt net of proceeds received were a use of cash of 401 million in 2012 compared to a source of cash of 1493 million in 2011 or a difference of 1894 million as discussed in more detail below please see note 8 — debt in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of debt refinancing activities in 2011 and 2012 additionally pca paid an additional 754 million to settle treasury locks in 2012 compared to 2011 please see note 9 – derivative instruments and hedging activities in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information also in 2012 the company paid higher dividends of 418 million including the 245 million of dividends that would have been paid in january of 2013 but were accelerated to december of 2012 this was partially offset by lower repurchases of pca common stock of 799 million and higher proceeds received from stock option exercises of 157 million during 2012 compared to 2011 

net cash used for financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 356 million compared to 928 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a decrease of 572 million or 616 during 2011 pca repurchased an additional 861 million of its common stock and paid an additional 142 million in dividends than it did in 2010 this was more than offset by 1500 million in proceeds received from borrowing under a new term loan in 2011 and 99 million in proceeds received from settling treasury locks in february 2011 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable with a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility on october 11 2011 pca amended the receivables credit facility agreement to extend the termination date to october 11 2014 and increase the borrowing capacity from 1500 million to 2000 million as of december 31 2012 pca had 910 million in additional borrowing capacity available under this facility and 1090 million of borrowings was outstanding

 the above table excludes interest payments on debt outstanding based on interest rates in effect and longterm debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2012 projected contractual interest payments would be approximately 288 million in 2013 and for each future year for the purpose of this disclosure we have assumed that pca’s variable and fixed rate longterm debt would be replaced at maturity with similar longterm debt and similar interest rates this disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest rates see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the impact of changes in interest rates on pca’s future cash flows 

the operating lease commitments capital commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 see note 8 — debt and note 12 — commitments and contingencies in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information pca is not required to make any pension plan contributions in 2013 under the “moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act” that was enacted in 2012 which among other items provided companies with some 

  

pension funding relief pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2013 see note 6 — employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

as of december 31 2012 pca had 1113 million of obligations for gross unrecognized tax benefits and an additional 26 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities at this time pca is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table see note 14 — income taxes in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities available borrowing capacity under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2012 pca had 3273 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities net of the impact on this borrowing capacity of 137 million of outstanding letters of credit currently pca’s primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances excluding unamortized debt discount and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2012 for pca’s senior credit facility the receivables credit facility and the senior notes 

 

 the above table excludes the annual noncash interest expense of 57 million from the amortization of the treasury locks over the terms for both the 650 senior notes due in 2018 and the 390 senior notes due in 2022 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

 

  

  

  

  

 these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition pca must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio under its senior credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness andor prohibit pca 

  

from drawing on its senior credit facility such acceleration may also constitute events of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility at december 31 2012 pca was in compliance with these covenants 

pca currently expects to incur normal capital expenditures of about 1250 million in 2013 primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance plus 500 million for either box plant acquisitions or strategic investments in our existing box plants 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities its ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

pca is subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 pca believes that it is currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we spent 258 million 260 million and 246 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

in 2004 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” published the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers these regulations were vacated and remanded by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in 2007 the epa proposed final regulations in march 2011 and concurrently announced its intent to reconsider certain provisions of the final rule in december 2011 the epa published proposed rules containing changes to the march 2011 rules and 

  

requested public comment on several of the rule revisions after reviewing public comments the epa published a revised final rule in january 2013 the january 2013 rule establishes a three year deadline for compliance which states are authorized to extend by an additional year if they so elect pca is currently assessing the impact of these regulations which are expected to require modifications to or replacement of certain of pca’s boilers pca currently estimates that compliance with the final rule will require capital expenditures between 450 million and 550 million over the next three years due to the complexity of these regulations and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations this estimate is subject to further revisions we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations in 2013 of up to 100 million and expect other environmental capital expenditures of about 20 million in 2013 total capital expenditures for environmental matters were 18 million 28 million and 11 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2012 remediation costs at pca’s mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2012 pca maintained an environmental reserve of 117 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects as of this filing the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the 117 million accrued as of december 31 2012 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of pca’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes environmental liabilities stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

pca believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included elsewhere in this report 

  

accounts receivable — allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

pca evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources pca records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected for all other customers the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on its historical collection experience if the company’s collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations pca’s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on pca’s experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of its gross selling price accordingly the company reserves 10 of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

as of december 31 2012 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 19 million which was unchanged compared to the december 31 2011 reserve for the year ended december 31 2012 the company recorded expense related to doubtful accounts of 10 million compared to expense of 01 million recorded during the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in bad debt expense of 09 million was due to expense from customers who had filed for bankruptcy or had liquidated for the year ended december 31 2011 the company recorded expense of 01 million related to doubtful accounts compared to income of 09 million in 2010 the income in 2010 of 09 million was primarily due to a 10 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to reflect the low level of actual losses over the previous three years 

inventories 

pca records its inventories at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 58 and 61 of inventories at current cost at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

pension and postretirement benefits 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 715 “compensation — retirement benefits” 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by pca based upon annual reviews 

for postretirement health care plan accounting pca reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

  

environmental liabilities 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under asc 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however the company’s estimates may change pca believes that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on its financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

stockbased compensation 

pca measures and records stockbased compensation cost in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” stock compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 the effective date of asc 718 and b compensation costs for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 the grant date fair value is estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 

pca recognizes compensation expense associated with option awards ratably over their vesting periods the company uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock the expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and 

  

employee terminations separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant the company has not granted any option awards since 2007 

the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of pca’s common stock on the grant date the company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods as pca’s board of directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s retirement the company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age 

income taxes 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

 

  

   

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts 

income from operations net income and diluted earnings per share excluding special items are nongaap financial measures management presents income from operations net income and diluted earnings per share excluding these special items to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that these measures provide useful information to investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliations of those nongaap measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap for the three months ended december 31 2012 and the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 follow 

 

  

  

    




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes for a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities see note 9 — derivative instruments and hedging activities to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included elsewhere in the report 

the interest rates on approximately 69 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 24 million annually

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend controls and procedures 

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2012 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2012 

during the quarter ended december 31 2012 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 

  

the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012 based on the specified criteria

 item 1 business tableend general 

packaging corporation of america we us our “pca” or the “company” is the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states in terms of production capacity during 2011 we produced 25 million tons of containerboard at our mills of which about 80 was consumed in pca’s corrugated products manufacturing plants 10 was sold to domestic customers and 10 was sold in the export market our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 325 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 26 billion in 2011 

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

 

 in 2011 we produced 15 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 10 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements with third parties on approximately 279000 acres of timberland 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

industry overview 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was 261 billion in 2011 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2010 fibre box association annual report 

 

   

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 575 companies and 1245 plants 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required and shipped to converters 

pca operations and products 

containerboard mills 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 20 lb to 47 lb mill capacities described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper basis weights and production can exceed estimated capacity if a higherthanestimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

the following four paragraphs describe our containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum capacity 2011 actual production and production capabilities 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest kraft linerboard mills in the united states its yearend 2011 annual estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association “afpa” is 1043000 tons in 2011 we produced 1007000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce the mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill its yearend 2011 annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa is 556000 tons in 2011 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 516000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces a range of basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest semichemical corrugating medium mills in the united states its yearend 2011 annual estimated production capacity as reported to the afpa is 538000 tons in 2011 we produced 538000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at tomahawk the tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill its yearend 2011 annual estimated production capacity on three paper machines as reported to the afpa is 438000 tons in 2011 we produced 438000 tons of corrugating medium on three paper machines at filer city filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb to 47 lb 

  

corrugated products 

we operate 71 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center six regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 71 manufacturing facilities 41 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 30 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants procure combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s corrugated plants and manufacture finished corrugated containers 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugated plant for the most part serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000 acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 12 years remaining on average 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold approximately 800000 acres of timberland we currently have in place supply agreements covering approximately 279000 of the 800000 acres sold the majority of the acreage covered by supply agreements is located in close proximity to our counce mill 

pca participates in the sustainable forestry initiative sfi and is certified under the sfi sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources pca is committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations who serve local and regional accounts we also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the graphic design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

  

distribution 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments typically represent from about 50 to 55 of the tons shipped and the remaining 45 to 50 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities 

our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to approximately 9000 customers in over 17000 locations about twothirds of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onethird of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than our valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2011 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 625000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 208000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 417000 tons or 17 of pca’s total fiber requirements 

energy supply energy at pca’s four mills is obtained through purchased or selfgenerated fuels and electricity fuel sources include coal natural gas oil purchased wood waste and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor and wood waste each of pca’s mills selfgenerate process steam requirements from byproducts black liquor and wood waste as well as from the various purchased fuels the process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity 

in 2011 pca’s four mills consumed about 41 million mmbtu’s to produce both steam and electricity of the 41 million mmbtu’s consumed about 62 was from mill generated byproducts and 38 was from purchased fuels of the 38 in purchased fuels 34 was from coal 28 from purchased wood waste and 33 from natural gas 

in 2011 our mills purchased approximately 90 million ckwh hundred kilowatt hours of electricity or the equivalent of 31 million mmbtu’s approximately 45 of the electricity consumed by our four mills in 2011 was generated onsite 

in 2011 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed about 21 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

in october 2009 pca announced major energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills to significantly reduce fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and reduce fossil fuel consumption at 

  

these facilities the projects were completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at the valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the counce mill we expect these projects to reduce our mill purchased fuels and electricity 

competition 

according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 575 us companies operating approximately 1245 plants most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our primary competitors include international paper company georgiapacific owned by koch industries inc and rocktenn company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company georgiapacific and rocktenn company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 8300 employees approximately 2500 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5800 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

based on an agreement reached with the usw in august 2008 the existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering uswrepresented employees 88 of mill hourly workforce were extended five years with this extension the usw contracts at our mills are currently set to expire between september 2013 and june 2015 agreements with other union mill employees 12 of mill hourly workforce expire between june 2012 and october 2014 based on an agreement reached with the usw in april 2009 the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering usw represented employees was extended up to five years contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between february 2012 and december 2017 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

during 2011 we experienced no work stoppages and have experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the five years prior to 2011 we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

2 clean water act cwa 

  

3 clean air act caa 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we spent approximately 260 million 246 million and 264 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally total capital costs for environmental matters were 28 million 11 million and 04 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we currently estimate 2012 environmental capital expenditures will be 10 million we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

in 2004 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” published the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers these regulations were vacated and remanded by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in 2007 the epa proposed final regulations in march 2011 which would require compliance in 2014 during 2011 the epa determined that it would reconsider certain provisions of the boiler mact regulations and in december 2011 the epa published proposed rules containing changes to the march 2011 rules the epa may make further changes to the proposed rules pca is currently assessing the impact of these regulations on its operations which could require significant modifications to certain of pca’s boilers due to the complexity of these regulations and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations the timing and amount of expenditures to be made by pca are uncertain but could be significant during the period before compliance is required 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2011 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately 32 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2011 we maintained an environmental reserve of 105 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 105 million reserve 51 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm as a part of the april 12 1999 transaction pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

as of the date of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 105 million accrued as of december 31 2011 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources our recentlycompleted major energy projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills are expected to significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels at those facilities while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected

industry risks 

industry cyclicality — imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and corrugated products and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard and corrugated products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations 

competition — the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations 

the containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

company risks 

cost of fiber — an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings 

pca has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills on approximately 279000 acres of timberland in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants approximately 400000 to 450000 tons of recycled fiber per year the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year depends on the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber as the company attempts to minimize total fiber costs 

the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals — an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing have risen these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs and transportation costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

  

material disruption of manufacturing — a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 

our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a number of events including unscheduled maintenance outages prolonged power failures an equipment failure fire explosion of a boiler labor difficulties natural catastrophes terrorism governmental regulations and other operational problems these events could cause us to be unable to service our customers or lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters — pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 1 “business — environmental matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years in addition environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

investment risks 

market price of our common stock — the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline 

securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

general risks 

economic conditions — our earnings and cash generated from operations could be significantly lower if a severe downturn in the us economy occurs again 

our operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the us economy and to a lesser extent by global economic conditions the significant downturn in the us economy impacted our industry and pca in late 2008 and continued into 2009 lowering the demand for our products and our mill production this lower demand and production reduced our revenues increased our unit production costs and lowered our earnings and our cash generated from operations during those periods demand for our products and pca’s mill production improved during 2010 and continued to improve in 2011 it is unknown whether economic conditions will again deteriorate or continue to improve in the event that economic conditions deteriorate our operating and financial performance will be adversely impacted lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments and another prolonged and severe downturn could possibly impact our ability to comply with our debt covenants

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend during september and october 2010 pca and eight other us and canadian containerboard producers were named as defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging violations of the sherman act the lawsuits have been consolidated in a single complaint under the caption kleen products llc v packaging corp of america et al the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to limit the supply of containerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of containerboard products during the period from august 2005 to the time of filing of the complaints the complaint was filed as a purported class action suit on behalf of all purchasers of containerboard products during such period the complaint seeks treble damages and costs including attorney’s fees the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint were denied by the court in april 2011 pca believes the allegations are without merit and will defend this lawsuit vigorously however as the lawsuit is in the early stages of discovery pca is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses 

pca is a party to various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

pca is the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states based on production capacity we operate four containerboard mills and 71 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the united states approximately 80 of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants the remaining 20 is sold to domestic customers or the export market we produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging 

in analyzing our operating performance we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results 

 

  

   

  

 historically supply and demand as well as industrywide inventory levels have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products in addition to us shipments approximately 10 of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries 

the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the us economy the us economy grew at a slower rate in 2011 than it did in 2010 as real gdp increased 17 in 2011 compared to a 30 increase in 2010 as reported by the u s department of commerce industrywide corrugated products shipments increased 05 in 2011 compared to 2010 and containerboard production was 03 higher than in 2010 as reported by industry trade publications pca experienced improvement in demand that exceeded the industry average and for the year our corrugated products shipments were up 50 compared to 2010 and containerboard production increased from 2443000 tons to 2499000 tons or up 23 setting a new record for annual production industry containerboard inventories at the end of december 2011 were 235 million tons more than 65000 tons below the tenyear average for yearending levels 

average prices for containerboard and corrugated products were higher during 2011 compared to 2010 reflecting a full year of the two published price increases that occurred in 2010 during 2011 the published price in industry trade publications for containerboard did not change 

increased pricing and improved demand favorably impacted pca’s 2011 earnings compared to 2010 however they were offset by higher costs for transportation chemicals fiber labor and other input items published recycled fiber costs in 2011 increased on average approximately 20 compared to 2010 at the end of 2011 published recycled fiber prices did decline and entered 2012 below the 2011 average price wood fiber costs in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010 levels as weather conditions in the us south were favorable for access to wood fiber transportation costs increased 9 from prior year levels as average diesel prices as reported by the us department of energy increased 28 from the 2010 average price labor related costs increased reflecting annual merit increases and increased costs for medical insurance and workers’ compensation our prices paid for purchased fuels and electricity each averaged approximately 5 higher for 2011 compared to the 2010 average 

as disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements pca is a producer of black liquor which is considered an alternative fuel when mixed with diesel making the black liquor an alternative fuel eligible for a 050 per gallon refundable alternative fuel mixture tax credit through december 31 2009 in an irs memorandum released during the second quarter of 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor also qualifies for the taxable cellulosic biofuel producer credit of 101 per gallon of biofuel produced in 2009 in a subsequent memorandum the irs concluded that a black liquor producer may claim the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit in the same taxable year for different volumes of black liquor the same gallon of fuel cannot receive both credits but different gallons of fuel can be claimed as either the alternative fuel mixture credit or the cellulosic biofuel producer credit pca received the required cellulosic biofuel producer registration code in september 2010 

prior to the irs’s memoranda and guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credits pca had recorded all tax credits resulting from black liquor production before december 31 2009 as alternative fuel mixture tax credits resulting in 1713 million in income in 2009 and an additional 92 million in the first quarter of 2010 based upon both irs memoranda and the 2010 guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credit pca analyzed the additional potential benefits from claiming the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for 2009 instead of the alternative fuel mixture credit or claiming a combination of the two credits for 2009 for the gallons of alternative fuels produced in 2009 pca claimed about twothirds of the gallons as cellulosic biofuel producer credits and about onethird of the gallons as alternative fuel mixture credits resulting in additional income of 385 million in 2010 and a reserve for uncertain tax positions of 1020 million this 

  

reserve relates to uncertainty concerning the proprietary biofuel process at the company’s filer city corrugating medium mill due to the unique and proprietary nature of the filer city mill process irs guidelines do not specifically address the process and uncertainty exists as a result the company recorded a 1020 million reserve for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” as of december 31 2011 including the 1020 million recorded as an uncertain tax position under asc 740 pca had as much as 1675 million of tax credits to be used to offset future tax payments the cellulosic biofuel producer credit is a taxable credit however the laws governing the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit are not completely defined the irs has not issued definitive guidance regarding such taxability pca believes that the manner in which the credit was claimed will not subject the company to federal or state income taxes on such benefits if it is determined that any of the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to taxation pca will be required to pay those taxes and take a corresponding charge to its net income during the first quarter of 2011 the company received notification that the irs will begin its review of the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits claimed in the 2009 federal income tax return and such review is under way 

on february 3 2012 pca amended its 2009 tax return to reflect a change in claimed gallons between the alternative fuel mixture credits and the cellulosic biofuel producer credits this change is expected to result in a first quarter 2012 noncash aftertax charge of 23 million 

excluding charges of 48 million or 005 per share for asset disposals related to major energy projects and income of 10 million or 001 per share for an adjustment related to medical benefits reserves we earned net income of 1618 million 161 per diluted share for the full year of 2011 this compares with 1663 million 162 per diluted share for the comparable period in 2010 excluding the income impact of the tax credits noted above of 477 million 046 per share and charges of 86 million 008 per diluted share for asset disposals related to major energy projects and other assets no longer in service and facility closure costs management excludes the above items and uses these measures to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included elsewhere in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” 

in the first quarter of 2012 our corrugated products shipments should be higher with four additional workdays compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and we also expect a full quarter’s earnings benefit from our major energy projects we expect normal first quarter cost increases from colder weather annual maintenance outages at our counce and valdosta mills timing related employee benefits a higher tax rate and pension expense average export containerboard prices are expected to be lower reflecting the full impact of fourth quarter price changes considering all of these items we expect first quarter earnings excluding special items including the noncash charge described above to be approximately equal to reported earnings of 040 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 are set forth below 

 

 net sales 

net sales increased by 1845 million or 76 for the year ended december 31 2011 from the year ended december 31 2010 net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes of corrugated products and containerboard 1226 million and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 619 million 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 50 to 325 billion square feet in 2011 compared to 310 billion square feet in 2010 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume also increased 50 in 2011 versus 2010 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year both 2011 and 2010 contained 251 workdays those days not falling on a weekend or holiday containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 12 to 513000 tons for the year ended december 31 2011 from 507000 tons in 2010 

income from operations 

income from operations increased by 873 million or 471 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 2010 as noted in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements pca received the cellulosic biofuel producer registration in september 2010 as a result our 2010 income from operations was reduced primarily due to reversing a portion of our 2009 alternative fuel mixture credits out of income from operations 960 million in order to claim cellulosic biofuel credits which were recorded in the provision for income taxes 1355 million in 2010 in addition income from operations included alternative fuel mixture credits in the amount of 92 million in 2010 excluding special items as detailed below under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” income from operations decreased 68 million for full year 2011 this decrease was primarily attributable to increased costs for transportation 205 million chemicals 167 million labor 134 million recycled fiber 100 million medical and workers’ compensation 89 million depreciation 81 million energy 48 million the impact of severe winter weather in first quarter 2011 35 million legal services 23 million travel entertainment and meetings 19 million warehousing requirements 17 million building repairs 15 million environmental expenses 14 million and other fringe benefits 12 million these increases were partially offset by increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 619 million and higher sales volume 294 million 

  

gross profit increased 97 million or 18 for the year ended december 31 2011 from the year ended december 31 2010 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 219 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2010 to 207 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to cost increases on a per unit basis described above 

selling and administrative expenses increased 115 million or 63 for the year ended december 31 2011 from the year ended december 31 2010 primarily as a result of increased salary expense 43 million reflecting annual merit increases fringe benefits 13 million warehouse costs related to customer requirements 17 million travel and meeting costs 16 million and other increased costs which were individually insignificant 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 64 million or 111 from the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses 40 million and increased costs for professional services related to legal matters 23 million 

other expense net decreased 92 million or 463 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease was primarily due to closure costs at two facilities 42 million and costs related to the writeoff of paper machine assets at tomahawk 28 million in 2010 in addition to reduced fixed asset disposal costs 16 million 

interest expense net and income taxes 

net interest expense decreased by 31 million or 96 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest 22 million related to the counce and valdosta major energy optimization projects during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

pca’s effective tax rate was 351 for the year ended december 31 2011 and 342 for the year ended december 31 2010 due to the impact of recording the alternative fuel mixture tax credits in 2010 excluding the impact of the tax credits the 2010 effective tax rate would have been 345 for the year ended december 31 2010 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the alternative fuel mixture tax credits in 2010 state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca had no material changes to its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” during 2011 in march 2011 the company was notified by the internal revenue service that it will begin its review of the 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns in the second quarter of 2011 this review is under way

total corrugated products volume sold increased 72 to 310 billion square feet in 2010 compared to 289 billion square feet in 2009 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 68 in 2010 from 2009 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase on a total shipments basis was due to the fact that 2010 had one more workday 251 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2009 250 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 176 to 507000 tons for the year ended december 31 2010 from 431000 tons in 2009 

income from operations 

income from operations decreased by 1671 million or 474 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 2009 as noted in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements pca received the cellulosic biofuel producer registration in september 2010 as a result our 2010 income from operations was reduced primarily due to reversing a portion of our 2009 alternative fuel mixture credits out of income from operations 960 million in order to claim cellulosic biofuel credits which were recorded in the provision for income taxes 1355 million in 2010 in addition income from operations included alternative fuel mixture credits in the amounts of 1684 million and 92 million respectively in 2009 and 2010 excluding special items as detailed below under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” income from operations increased 994 million for full year 2010 this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 1113 million higher sales volume 584 million partially offset by increased costs for fiber 478 million transportation 106 million labor and fringe benefits 78 million and maintenance and building repairs 73 million 

gross profit increased 1056 million or 248 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 199 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2009 to 219 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to the increases of sales prices and volume described previously 

selling and administrative expenses increased 90 million or 52 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of increased salary expense 61 million including annual merit increases incentive compensation and temporary labor labor related benefits 10 million travel and meeting costs 11 million and broker commissions 07 million 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 35 million or 64 from the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses 23 million and costs for professional services regarding legal tax and audit matters 12 million 

other expense net increased 54 million or 374 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to closure costs at two facilities 42 million and costs related to the writeoff of paper machine assets at tomahawk 28 million partially offset by reduced expenses related to legal claims 15 million 

  

interest expense net and income taxes 

net interest expense decreased by 32 million or 90 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest 39 million related to the counce and valdosta major energy optimization projects during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 

due to the impact of recording the fuel tax credits pca’s effective tax rate was 342 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 161 for the year ended december 31 2009 excluding the impact of the fuel tax credits the effective tax rate would have been 345 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 363 for the same period in 2009 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the fuel tax credits state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca recorded a material change in its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” of 1020 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the amendment of the 2009 federal income tax return to claim gallons of alternative fuel produced at the filer city michigan mill due to the proprietary nature of the biofuel process at the filer city mill uncertainty as to total fuel gallons qualifying for the credit exists which caused the additional reserve pending the timing and the outcome of the irs review that is currently under way which is not determinable at this time the reserve for uncertain tax positions could change significantly 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 3455 million compared to 3499 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a decrease of 44 million or 13 net income excluding the income from the tax credits described in note 16 to the financial statements included in this report of 477 million in 2010 was 1580 million and 1577 million respectively for 2011 and 2010 depreciation depletion and amortization expense was higher by 77 million primarily due to increased depreciation from the recentlycompleted major energy projects and requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by 141 million in 2011 compared to 2010 which increased net cash provided by operating activities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an improvement in accounts receivable 333 million resulting from price increases in 2010 and favorable changes in inventory 200 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a 2010 build in inventory in anticipation of the downtime related to the major energy project work completed in 2011 this was partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable 261 million and higher pension contributions 69 million in 2011 compared to 2010 in addition pca utilized fewer alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer credits to reduce federal tax payments in 2011 than it did in 2010 resulting in higher cash taxes paid 336 million in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca’s operating needs the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses and seasonal fluctuations in its operations 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 3499 million compared to 3061 million for the year ended december 31 2009 an increase of 438 million or 143 net 

  

income excluding the income from the tax credits described in note 16 to the financial statements included in this report of 477 million in 2010 and 1713 million in 2009 was 1577 million and 946 million respectively for 2010 and 2009 an increase of 631 million that increased net cash provided by operating activities additionally more alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits 242 million were used to reduce federal tax payments during 2010 compared to 2009 during 2010 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 191 million this was partially offset by higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities 516 million driven by higher accounts receivable levels in 2010 as a result of both higher 2010 sales volumes and pricing 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 288 million or 90 to 3501 million compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily related to 573 million in corrugated products business acquisitions completed in 2011 and higher additions to other longterm assets of 104 million in 2011 compared to 2010 this was partially offset by lower additions to property plant and equipment of 400 million during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to reduced spending 559 million on the major energy optimization projects 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 2020 million or 1693 to 3213 million compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily related to higher additions to property plant and equipment of 2060 million which included 1759 million for the major energy optimization projects at our linerboard mills during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 partially offsetting this increase was a 31 million acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2009 as described in note 18 to the financial statements 

as of december 31 2011 pca had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of 404 million pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 356 million compared to 928 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a decrease of 572 million or 616 the decrease was primarily attributable to 1500 million of proceeds from borrowing under a new term loan in october 2011 and 99 million in proceeds from the settlement of treasury locks received in february 2011 partially offset by higher repurchases of pca common stock of 861 million as well as higher dividends paid of 142 million during 2011 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 928 million for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 173 million or 229 compared to the same period in 2009 the difference was primarily attributable to repurchases of pca common stock of 389 million during 2010 partially offset by lower common stock dividends paid of 151 million and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 65 million during 2010 compared to 2009 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders initially established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit 

  

facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on october 11 2011 pca amended the receivables credit facility agreement which extended the termination date to october 11 2014 and increased the borrowing availability from 1500 million to 2000 million as of december 31 2011 pca had 910 million in additional borrowing capacity available under this facility and 1090 million of borrowings was outstanding 

on july 21 2003 pca offered to qualified institutional investors 1500 million of 4375 senior notes which matured in 2008 and 4000 million of 575 senior notes due 2013 on march 25 2008 pca refinanced the fiveyear notes issuing 1500 million of 650 senior notes due march 15 2018 through a registered public offering 

on august 1 2011 pca entered into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty to protect against increases in the tenyear us treasury note rate the treasury rate will serve as a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the new debt securities the company expects to issue in the future to refinance pca’s currently outstanding 4000 million of senior notes that mature in 2013 at december 31 2011 the company had a notional value of 4000 million in an interest rate protection agreement outstanding that is expected to settle by the end of 2012 

on october 11 2011 pca replaced its senior credit facility that was scheduled to terminate in april 2013 with a new senior credit facility that provides a 1500 million term loan facility which pca fully borrowed and a 2500 million revolving credit facility including a 500 million subfacility for letters of credit borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at libor plus a margin that is determined based upon pca’s credit ratings pca is required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loan of 38 million beginning march 31 2012 through september 30 2016 with the balance due at maturity the new senior credit facility will terminate on october 11 2016 pca had no borrowings and 143 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility resulting in 2357 million in unused borrowing capacity as of december 31 2011 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2011 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2011 

 

   

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 06 million at december 31 2011 and interest payments on debt outstanding based on interest rates in effect and longterm debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2011 projected contractual interest payments would be approximately 371 million in 2012 and for each future year for the purpose of this disclosure we have assumed that pca’s variable and fixed rate longterm debt would be replaced at maturity with similar longterm debt and similar interest rates this disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest rates see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the impact of changes in interest rates on pca’s future cash flows 

the operating lease commitments capital commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 see notes 8 and 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2011 see note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of december 31 2011 pca’s expected payment for significant contractual obligations excludes 63 million of obligations for uncertain tax positions because pca cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for such liability see note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities available borrowing capacity under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2011 pca had 3267 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities net of the impact on this borrowing capacity of 143 million of outstanding letters of credit currently pca’s primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2011 for pca’s revolving credit facility the receivables credit facility and the senior notes 

 

 the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 06 million at december 31 2011 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 228 million received in july 2003 and the noncash expense from the annual amortization of the 44 million paid in march 2008 to settle the treasury locks related to the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 and is included in interest expense net 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

 

   

  

  

  

 these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition pca must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio under its senior revolving credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness andor prohibit pca from drawing on the revolving credit facility such acceleration may also constitute events of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility at december 31 2011 pca was in compliance with these covenants 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 404 million in 2012 primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities its ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

pca is subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 pca believes that it is currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we spent approximately 260 million 246 million and 264 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws 

  

additionally total capital costs for environmental matters were 28 million 11 million and 04 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and the company currently estimates 2012 environmental capital expenditures will be 10 million 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

in 2004 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” published the boiler mact regulations establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers these regulations were vacated and remanded by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in 2007 the epa proposed final regulations in march 2011 which would require compliance in 2014 during 2011 the epa determined that it would reconsider certain provisions of the boiler mact regulations and in december 2011 the epa published proposed rules containing changes to the march 2011 rules the epa may make further changes to the proposed rules pca is currently assessing the impact of these regulations on its operations which could require significant modifications to certain of pca’s boilers due to the complexity of these regulations and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations the timing and amount of expenditures to be made by pca are uncertain but could be significant during the period before compliance is required 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2011 remediation costs at pca’s mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2011 pca maintained an environmental reserve of 105 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects as of this filing the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 105 million accrued as of december 31 2011 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources our energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills are expected to significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels at those facilities while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of pca’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements 

  

requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes environmental liabilities stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

pca believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

accounts receivable — allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

pca evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources pca records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected for all other customers the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on its historical collection experience if the company’s collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations pca’s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on pca’s experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of its gross selling price accordingly the company reserves 10 of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

as of december 31 2011 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 19 million compared to 25 million at december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 the company recorded expense related to doubtful accounts of 01 million compared to income of 09 million recorded during the year ended december 31 2010 the income in 2010 of 09 million was primarily due to a 10 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to reflect the low level of actual losses over the previous three years for the year ended december 31 2010 the company recorded income of 09 million related to doubtful accounts compared to expense of 15 million in 2009 the decrease in bad debt expense of 24 million between 2009 and 2010 was primarily due to a 10 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to reflect the low level of actual losses over the previous three years and a 09 million decrease in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy protection 

inventories 

pca records its inventories at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 61 and 65 of inventories at current cost at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 715 “compensation — retirement benefits” 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by pca based upon annual reviews 

for postretirement health care plan accounting pca reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

environmental liabilities 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under asc 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however the company’s estimates may change pca believes that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on its financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

  

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

stockbased compensation 

pca measures and records stockbased compensation cost in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” stock compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 the effective date of asc 718 and b compensation costs for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 the grant date fair value is estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 

pca recognizes compensation expense associated with option awards ratably over their vesting periods the company uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock the expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of pca’s common stock on the grant date the company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods as pca’s board of directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s retirement the company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age 

income taxes 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

 

  

   

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts 

income from operations net income and diluted earnings per share excluding special items are nongaap financial measures management presents income from operations net income and diluted earnings per share excluding these special items to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess its operating performance and believes that these measures provide useful information to investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliations of those nongaap measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 follow 

 

  

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes for a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities see note 9 to pca’s consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in the report 

the interest rates on approximately 68 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 26 million annually in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend controls and procedures 

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2011 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2011 

during the quarter ended december 31 2011 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 based on the specified criteria

general 

 

packaging corporation of america we us our “pca” or the “company” is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states in terms of production capacity during 2010 we produced 24 million tons of containerboard at our mills of which about 80 was consumed in pca’s corrugated products manufacturing plants 9 was sold to domestic customers and 11 was sold in the export market our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 310 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 24 billion in 2010 

 

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

 

 

 

in 2010 we produced 15 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 09 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements with third parties on approximately 281000 acres of timberland 

 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

 

industry overview 

 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was 250 billion in 2010 

 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2009 fibre box association annual report 

 

 

 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 585 companies and 1260 plants 

 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of 

corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required and shipped to converters 

 

pca operations and products 

 

containerboard mills 

 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 20 lb to 47 lb mill capacities described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper basis weights and production can exceed estimated capacity if a higherthanestimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

 

the following four paragraphs describe our containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum capacity 2010 actual production and production capabilities 

 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest kraft linerboard mills in the united states its estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association “afpa” is approximately 1007000 tons per year in 2010 we produced 998000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce the mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity of approximately 495000 tons per year as reported to the afpa in 2010 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 482000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces a range of basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest semichemical corrugating medium mills in the united states with an estimated production capacity of 523000 tons per year as reported to the afpa in 2010 we produced 529000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at tomahawk the tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

 

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated production capacity of 435000 tons on three paper machines as reported to the afpa in 2010 we produced 434000 tons of corrugating medium at filer city filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb to 47 lb 

 

corrugated products 

 

we operate 67 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center six regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 67 manufacturing facilities 39 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 28 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers 

 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugated plant for the most part serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

 

timberland 

 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88000 acres of timberland located near our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 13 years remaining on average 

 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold approximately 800000 acres of timberland we currently have in place supply agreements covering approximately 281000 of the 800000 acres sold the majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close proximity to our counce mill 

 

pca participates in the sustainable forestry initiative sfi and is certified under the sfi fiber sourcing standards these standards are aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of forestry resources pca is committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who serve local and regional accounts we also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the graphic design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

 

distribution 

 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments represent about 50 to 55 of the tons shipped and the remaining 45 to 50 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities 

 

our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

 

customers 

 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 9200 customers in over 16700 locations about twothirds of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onethird of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

major raw materials used 

 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than our valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2010 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 638000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 200000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 438000 tons or 18 of pca’s total fiber requirements 

 

energy supply energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility in recent history natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark during 2010 113 million mmbtu’s million btu’s or approximately 70 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 36 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 22 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 03 million mmbtu’s of oil 2 of the mills’ total purchased fuels 

 

each of pca’s corrugated plants has a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2010 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 20 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

 

the following table shows pca’s purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2010 

 

 

 

approximately 42 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite our mills purchase approximately 9300000 ckwh hundred kilowatt hours annually or the equivalent of 32 million mmbtu’s pca’s corrugated products plants purchase about 2276000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 08 million mmbtu’s 

in october 2009 pca announced that it will undertake major energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills which are expected to significantly reduce fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and nearly eliminate fossil fuel consumption at these facilities the projects include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at the valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the counce mill the total capital expenditures for these projects are expected to be about 295 million to be spent over two years and the projects are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 

 

competition 

 

according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 585 us companies operating approximately 1260 plants most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our primary competitors include international paper company georgiapacific owned by koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation and templeinland inc however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company georgiapacific smurfitstone container corporation and templeinland inc as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 8100 employees approximately 2500 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5600 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

 

based on an agreement reached with the usw in august 2008 the existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering uswrepresented employees 88 of mill hourly workforce were extended five years with this extension the usw contracts at our mills are currently set to expire between september 2013 and june 2015 agreements with other union mill employees 12 of mill hourly workforce expire between june 2012 and october 2014 based on an agreement reached with the usw in april 2009 the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering usw represented employees was extended up to five years contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between march 2011 and october 2015 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

 

during 2010 we experienced no work stoppages and have experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the five years prior to 2010 we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

 

2 clean water act cwa 

 

3 clean air act caa 

 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we spent approximately 246 million 264 million and 235 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally total capital costs for environmental matters were 11 million 04 million and 35 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we currently estimate 2011 environmental capital expenditures will be 33 million we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2010 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately 32 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2010 we maintained an environmental reserve of 97 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 97 million reserve 49 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm as a part of the april 12 1999 transaction pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

 

as of the date of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 97 million accrued as of december 31 2010 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities 

which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources our energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011 while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected

industry risks 

 

industry cyclicality — imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and corrugated products and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard and corrugated products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations 

competition — the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations 

 

the containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

 

company risks 

 

cost of fiber — an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings 

 

pca has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at our counce tennessee and valdosta georgia mills on approximately 281000 acres of timberland in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

 

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants approximately 400000 to 450000 tons of recycled fiber per year the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year depends on the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber as the company attempts to minimize total fiber costs 

 

the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals — an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in recent years in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing have risen these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

 

material disruption of manufacturing — a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 

 

our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a number of events including unscheduled maintenance outages prolonged power failures an equipment failure explosion of a boiler labor difficulties natural catastrophes terrorism governmental regulations and other operational problems these events could lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters — pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 1 “business — environmental matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

 

investment risks 

 

market price of our common stock — the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline 

 

securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

 

general risks 

 

economic conditions — our earnings and cash generated from operations could be significantly lower if a severe downturn in the us economy occurs again 

 

our operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the us economy and to a lesser extent by global economic conditions the significant downturn in the us economy impacted our industry and pca in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued into the first half of 2009 lowering the demand for our products and our mill production this lower demand and production reduced our revenues increased our unit production costs and lowered our earnings and our cash generated from operations demand for our products and pca’s mill production improved during the second half of 2009 and continued to improve in 2010 it is unknown whether economic conditions will again deteriorate or continue to improve in the event that economic conditions deteriorate our operating and financial performance will be adversely impacted lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments and another prolonged and severe downturn could possibly impact our ability to comply with our debt covenants

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

during september and october 2010 pca and eight other us and canadian containerboard producers were named as defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging violations of the sherman act the lawsuits have been consolidated in a single complaint under the caption kleen products llc v packaging corp of america et al the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to limit the supply of containerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of containerboard products during the period from august 2005 to the time of filing of the complaints the complaint was filed as a purported class action suit on behalf of all purchasers of containerboard products during such period the complaint seeks treble damages and costs including attorney’s fees pca believes the allegations are without merit and will defend this lawsuit vigorously however as the lawsuit is in preliminary stages pca is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses 

 

pca is a party to various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

 

overview 

 

pca is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states based on production capacity we operate four containerboard mills and 67 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the united states approximately 80 of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants the remaining 20 is sold to domestic customers or the export market we produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging 

in analyzing our operating performance we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results 

 

  

historically supply and demand as well as industrywide inventory levels have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products in addition to us shipments approximately 10 of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries 

 

the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the us economy throughout 2010 the us economy steadily improved after the effects of the severe downturn which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued into 2009 industrywide corrugated products shipments increased 35 in 2010 compared to 2009 and containerboard production was 71 higher than in 2009 supported in part by strong export demand which in 2010 was 82 above 2009 levels pca also experienced continued improvement in demand and for the year our corrugated products shipments were up 72 compared to 2009 returning to preeconomic downturn levels and containerboard production increased from 2258000 tons to 2443000 tons or up 82 pca mills ran at almost 100 of capacity and essentially equaled their previous record for annual production industry containerboard inventories at the end of december 2010 were 23 million tons more than 150000 tons below the ten year average for yearending levels 

 

prices for containerboard and corrugated products were higher during 2010 compared to 2009 with industry published prices for containerboard increasing twice during the year up 50 per ton in january 2010 and up an additional 60 per ton in april 2010 

 

increased pricing and improved demand favorably impacted pca’s 2010 earnings and were only partially offset by higher fiber transportation labor and other input costs published recycled fiber costs in 2010 more than doubled on average up 122 compared to 2009 at the end of 2010 published recycled fiber prices were up an additional 30 per ton above the 2010 average price wood fiber costs in 2010 were higher than they were in 2009 on average up 7 compared to the prior year early in 2010 poor weather conditions in the us south made it difficult to access wood fiber driving wood costs to higher levels as the year progressed more normal weather patterns prevailed and wood costs in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased to below fourth quarter 2009 levels transportation costs increased 6 from prior year levels as diesel prices increased during the year labor related costs increased reflecting annual merit increases and increased incentives associated with the company’s year over year increase in our earnings our costs for purchased fuels and electricity averaged approximately 4 lower for the full year 2010 compared to 2009 however they did increase during the second half of the year as the strengthening us economy drove higher energy costs 

 

as disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements pca is a producer of black liquor which is considered an alternative fuel when mixed with diesel making the black liquor an alternative fuel eligible for a 050 per gallon refundable alternative fuel mixture tax credit through december 31 2009 in a chief counsel’s office of the internal revenue service memorandum am2010002 dated june 28 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor also qualifies for the taxable cellulosic biofuel producer credit of 101 per gallon of biofuel produced in 2009 pca received the required cellulosic biofuel producer registration code on september 13 2010 in a chief counsel’s office of the internal revenue service memorandum am2010004 dated october 5 2010 the irs concluded that a black liquor producer may claim the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit in the same taxable year for different volumes of black liquor the same gallon of fuel cannot receive both credits but different gallons of fuel can be claimed as either the alternative fuel mixture credit or the cellulosic biofuel producer credit 

 

prior to the irs’s memorandum and guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credits and pca’s registration as a cellulosic biofuel producer pca had recorded all tax credits resulting from black liquor 

production before december 31 2009 as alternative fuel mixture tax credits resulting in 1713 million in income in 2009 and an additional 92 million in the first quarter of 2010 based upon both the irs memoranda and the 2010 guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credit pca analyzed the additional potential benefits from claiming the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for 2009 instead of the alternative fuel mixture credit or claiming a combination of the two credits for 2009 for the gallons of alternative fuels produced in 2009 pca claimed about twothirds of the gallons as cellulosic biofuel producer credits and about onethird of the gallons as alternative fuel mixture credits this resulted in additional net income of 477 million in 2010 and a reserve for uncertain tax positions of 1020 million this reserve relates to uncertainty concerning our proprietary biofuel process at our filer city corrugating medium mill because the filer city mill process is unique and irs guidelines do not specifically address the process uncertainty exists as of december 31 2010 including the 1020 million recorded as an uncertain tax position under asc 740 “income taxes” pca has as much as 2061 million of tax credits to be used to offset future cash tax payments the cellulosic biofuel producer credit is a taxable credit however the laws governing the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit are not completely defined the irs has not issued definitive guidance regarding such taxability pca believes that the manner in which the credit was claimed will not subject it to federal or state income taxes on such benefits if it is determined that any of the credits are subject to taxation pca will be required to pay those taxes and take a corresponding charge to its net income see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of the alternative fuel mixture tax credits and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit 

 

excluding the impact of the tax credits described above and asset disposal charges relating to our major energy projects at our linerboard mills and other assets no longer in service and facility closure costs we earned net income of 1663 million 162 per diluted share for the full year of 2010 compared with 959 million 094 per diluted share for the comparable period in 2009 management uses these measures to focus on pca’s ongoing operations and assess our operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results reconciliations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included elsewhere in item 7 under “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts” 

 

in the first quarter of 2011 our counce and valdosta linerboard mills will be shut down for approximately one week for their normal maintenance outages the valdosta shutdown will continue into april making that mill’s total shutdown 11 days the maintenance downtime in the first quarter will result in lower production and increased costs higher fiber costs as well as increased energy costs associated with colder weather a higher effective tax rate and higher timingrelated benefit costs are also expected in the first quarter considering all these items we estimate our first quarter earnings before any special items will be lower than our fourth quarter earnings before special items of 53 million which excludes net income of 5 million from cellulosic biofuel tax credits and a charge of 3 million after tax from asset disposals related to the energy optimization projects and assets no longer in service 

results of operations 

 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 are set forth below 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased by 2880 million or 134 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes of corrugated products and containerboard 1767 million and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 1113 million 

 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 72 to 310 billion square feet in 2010 compared to 289 billion square feet in 2009 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 68 in 2010 from 2009 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase on a total shipments basis was due to the fact that 2010 had one more workday 251 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2009 250 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 176 to 507000 tons for the year ended december 31 2010 from 431000 tons in 2009 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations decreased by 1671 million or 474 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 2009 as noted in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements pca received the cellulosic biofuel producer registration in september 2010 as a result our 2010 income from operations was reduced primarily due to reversing a portion of our 2009 alternative fuel mixture credits out of income from operations 960 million in order to claim cellulosic biofuel credits which were recorded in the provision for income taxes 1355 million in 2010 in addition income from operations included alternative fuel mixture credits in the amounts of 1684 million and 92 million respectively in 2009 and 2010 excluding the impact of tax credits energy project related asset disposals 62 million in 2010 and 20 million in 2009 2010 charges for two plant closings 42 million and the 2010 writeoff of paper machine assets at the tomahawk wisconsin medium mill 28 million income from operations increased 994 million for full year 2010 this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 1113 million higher sales volume 584 million partially offset by increased costs for fiber 478 million transportation 106 million labor and fringe benefits 78 million and maintenance and building repairs 73 million 

 

gross profit increased 1056 million or 248 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 199 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2009 to 219 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to the increases of sales prices and volume described previously 

selling and administrative expenses increased 90 million or 52 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of increased salary expense 61 million including annual merit increases incentive compensation and temporary labor labor related benefits 10 million travel and meeting costs 11 million and broker commissions 07 million 

 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 35 million or 64 from the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses 23 million and costs for professional services regarding legal tax and audit matters 12 million 

 

other expense net increased 54 million or 374 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to closure costs at two facilities 42 million and costs related to the writeoff of paper machine assets at tomahawk 28 million partially offset by reduced expenses related to legal claims 15 million 

 

interest expense net and income taxes 

 

net interest expense decreased by 32 million or 90 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest 39 million related to the counce and valdosta major energy optimization projects during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 

 

due to the impact of recording the fuel tax credits pca’s effective tax rate was 342 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 161 for the year ended december 31 2009 excluding the impact of the fuel tax credits the effective tax rate would have been 345 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 363 for the same period in 2009 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the fuel tax credits state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca recorded a material change in its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” of 1020 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the amendment of the 2009 federal income tax return to claim gallons of alternative fuel produced at the filer city michigan mill due to the proprietary nature of the biofuel process at the filer city mill uncertainty as to total fuel gallons qualifying for the credit exists which caused the additional reserve the company expects the irs to review the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits claimed in the 2009 federal income tax return pending the timing and the outcome of the irs review which is not determinable at this time the reserve for uncertain tax positions could change significantly 

 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 are set forth below 

 

 

net sales 

 

net sales decreased by 2129 million or 90 for the year ended december 31 2009 from the year ended december 31 2008 net sales decreased primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume 1455 million and decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 674 million 

 

total corrugated products volume sold decreased 46 to 289 billion square feet in 2009 compared to 303 billion square feet in 2008 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume decreased 38 in 2009 from 2008 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage decrease on a total shipments basis was due to the fact that 2009 had two fewer workdays 250 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2008 252 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 99 to 431000 tons for the year ended december 31 2009 from 478000 tons in 2008 outside sales of both corrugated products and containerboard began 2009 with significantly lower volumes compared to 2008 and steadily improved throughout the year 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations increased by 1107 million or 458 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2008 primarily attributable to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit of 1684 million described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements excluding the alternative fuel mixture tax credit and asset disposal charges of 20 million income from operations decreased 578 million for full year 2009 which was primarily attributable to decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 674 million lower sales volume 525 million and increased labor and fringe benefit costs 80 million partially offset by decreased costs of energy 245 million transportation 237 million recycled fiber 189 million and wood fiber costs 35 million 

 

gross profit decreased 648 million or 132 for the year ended december 31 2009 from the year ended december 31 2008 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 208 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2008 to 199 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the decreases of sales prices and volume described previously 

 

selling and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged up 01 for the year ended december 31 2009 from the year ended december 31 2008 

 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 65 million or 106 from the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower salary and fringe benefit expenses 59 million and other items which were individually insignificant 

 

other expense net decreased 07 million or 47 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower legal related costs 16 million partially offset by increased fixed asset disposal costs 08 million 

 

interest expense net and income taxes 

 

interest expense net of interest income increased by 38 million or 120 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 due to lower interest rates on investments which reduced interest income by 50 million in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

pca’s total effective tax rate was 161 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 355 for the year ended december 31 2008 excluding the impact of fuel tax credits the effective tax rate would have been 363 in 2009 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the alternative fuel mixture tax credit in 2009 state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca had no material changes to its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” in 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 3499 million compared to 3061 million for the year ended december 31 2009 an increase of 438 million or 143 net income excluding the income from the tax credits described in note 16 to the financial statements included in this report of 477 million in 2010 and 1713 million in 2009 was 1577 million and 946 million respectively for 2010 and 2009 an increase of 631 million that increased net cash provided by operating activities additionally more alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits 242 million were used to reduce federal tax payments during 2010 compared to 2009 during 2010 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 191 million this was partially offset by higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities 516 million driven by higher accounts receivable levels in 2010 as a result of both higher 2010 sales volumes and pricing cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca’s operating needs the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses and seasonal fluctuations in the our operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 368 million or 137 to 3061 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 net income excluding income from alternative fuel mixture tax credits described in note 16 to the financial statements included in this report was 946 million for 2009 compared to 1356 million for 2008 a decrease of 410 million that reduced net cash provided by operating activities by the same amount this decrease however was more than offset by reduced operating cash requirements including a 484 million net reduction in federal tax payments after applying alternative fuel mixture tax credits during 2009 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 223 million additionally requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by 339 million in 2009 compared to 2008 driven for the most part by receivables and payables levels both of which were impacted by the economic downturn this was partially offset by higher pension contributions in 2009 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 2020 million or 1693 to 3213 million compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily related to higher additions to property plant and equipment of 2060 million which included 1759 million for the major energy optimization projects at our linerboard mills during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 partially offsetting this increase was a 31 million acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2009 as described in note 18 to the financial statements 

 

net cash used for investing activities decreased 152 million or 113 to 1193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was due to lower additions to property plant and equipment of 188 million in 2009 compared to 2008 which was partially offset by a 31 million acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2009 

 

as of december 31 2010 pca had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of 1433 million for 2011 including 1092 million for the major energy projects at its counce and valdosta mills pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 928 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a difference of 173 million or 229 compared to the same period in 2009 the difference was primarily attributable to repurchases of pca common stock of 389 million during 2010 partially offset by lower common stock dividends paid of 151 million and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 65 million during 2010 compared to 2009 

 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 755 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 1380 million or 647 compared to the same period in 2008 the difference was primarily attributable to lower debt payments of 1697 million in 2009 partially offset by 1452 million in net proceeds received from pca’s notes offering in 2008 described below additionally pca made no common stock repurchases in 2009 compared to 657 million in repurchases of pca common stock during 2008 and lower common stock dividends of 769 million paid in 2009 compared to 1251 million paid in 2008 

 

in connection with the senior notes offering in march of 2008 pca received proceeds net of discount of 1499 million and paid 44 million for settlement of a treasury lock that it entered into to protect against increases in the tenyear us treasury rate which served as a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the notes pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of 03 million in connection with the senior notes offering pca used the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand to repay all of the 1500 million of outstanding 4 3  8  senior notes that were due on august 1 2008 

 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times the facility which pca plans on renewing is scheduled to terminate on march 1 2011 as of december 31 2010 1090 million was outstanding the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2010 was 1090 million 

 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3  8  senior notes due august 1 2008 and 4000 million of 5 3  4  senior notes due august 1 2013 on march 25 2008 pca issued 1500 million of 6 1  2  senior notes due march 15 2018 through a registered public offering the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand were used to repay all of the 1500 million of 4 3  8  senior notes which matured on august 1 2008 

 

on march 31 2008 pca repaid all borrowings under its old senior credit facility this facility was replaced with a senior credit facility that provides a new 1500 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit the new senior credit facility closed on april 15 2008 the new revolving credit facility is available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the new revolving credit facility will terminate in april 2013 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2010 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2010 

 

 

 

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 09 million at december 31 2010 and interest payments on debt outstanding based on interest rates in effect and longterm debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2010 projected contractual interest payments would be approximately 345 million in 2011 and for each future year for the purpose of this disclosure pca’s variable and fixed rate longterm debt would be replaced at maturity with similar longterm debt and similar interest rates this disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest rates see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the impact of changes in interest rates on pca’s future cash flows 

 

the operating lease commitments capital commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 see notes 8 and 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2011 see note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company’s expected payment for significant contractual obligations excludes 76 million of obligations for uncertain tax positions because the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for such liability see note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2010 pca had 1722 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities net of the impact on this borrowing capacity of 188 million of outstanding letters of credit currently pca’s primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2010 for pca’s revolving credit facility the receivables credit facility and the senior notes 

 

 

 

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 09 million at december 31 2010 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 228 million received in july 2003 and the noncash expense from the annual amortization of the 44 million paid in march 2008 to settle the treasury locks related to the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 and is included in interest expense net 

 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

 

  

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

 

in addition pca must maintain minimum net worth and maximum debt to total capitalization and minimum interest coverage ratios under the revolving credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness andor prohibit pca from drawing on the revolving credit facility such an acceleration may also constitute an event of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility at december 31 2010 pca was in compliance with these covenants 

 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 2550 million in 2011 including 1150 million for major energy optimization projects at its counce and valdosta mills and 400 million for strategic projects in the box plants the remaining 1000 million in expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

 

pca is subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

  

pca believes that it is currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we spent approximately 246 million 264 million and 235 million respectively to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws additionally total capital costs for environmental matters were 11 million 04 million and 35 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and the company currently estimates 2011 environmental capital expenditures will be 33 million 

 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2010 remediation costs at pca’s mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2010 pca maintained an environmental reserve of 97 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects as of this filing the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 97 million accrued as of december 31 2010 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources our energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard 

mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011 while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of pca’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes environmental liabilities stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

pca believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

accounts receivable — allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

 

pca evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources pca records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected for all other customers the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on its historical collection experience if the company’s collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations pca’s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 

 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on pca’s experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of its gross selling price accordingly the company reserves 10 of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

 

as of december 31 2010 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 25 million compared to 39 million at december 31 2009 the change of balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts resulted in income of 09 million in 2010 compared to expense of 15 million in 2009 the decrease in bad debt expense of 24 million was primarily due to a 10 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to reflect the actual average losses over the past three years and a 09 million decrease in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy for the year ended december 31 2009 bad debt expense was 15 million compared to 42 million in 2008 the decrease in bad debt expense of 27 million was primarily attributable to a 14 million decrease in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and a recovery of 14 million from one customer that had previously filed for bankruptcy 

 

inventories 

 

pca records its inventories at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those 

projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 65 and 62 of inventories at current cost at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 715 “compensation — retirement benefits” 

 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

 

the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by pca based upon annual reviews 

 

for postretirement health care plan accounting pca reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

 

environmental liabilities 

 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under asc 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however the company’s estimates may change pca believes that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on its financial statements 

 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

 

revenue recognition 

 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

pca measures and records stockbased compensation cost in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” stock compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 the effective date of asc 718 and b compensation costs for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 the grant date fair value is estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 

 

pca recognizes compensation expense associated with option awards ratably over their vesting periods the company uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock the expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 

 

the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of pca’s common stock on the grant date the company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods as pca’s board of directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s retirement the company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age 

 

income taxes 

 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes for a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities see note 9 to pca’s consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in the report 

 

the interest rates on approximately 84 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 11 million annually in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend  

controls and procedures 

 

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2010 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2010 

 

during the quarter ended december 31 2010 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010 based on the specified criteria

general 

 

packaging corporation of america we us our “pca” or the “company” is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states in terms of production capacity during 2009 we produced 2258000 million tons of containerboard at our mills of which about 80 was consumed in pca’s corrugated products manufacturing plants 11 was sold to domestic customers and 9 was sold in the export market our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 289 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 215 billion in 2009 

 

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

 

 

 

in 2009 we produced 14 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 09 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 91000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements with third parties on approximately 352000 acres of timberland 

 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

 

industry overview 

 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was 24 billion in 2009 

 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2008 fibre box association annual report 

 

 

 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 625 companies and 1340 plants 

 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce 

corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required and shipped to converters 

 

pca operations and products 

 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 20 lb to 47 lb mill capacities described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper basis weights and production can exceed estimated capacity if a higherthanestimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

 

the following four paragraphs describe our containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum capacity 2009 actual production and production capabilities 

 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest kraft linerboard mills in the united states its estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association “afpa” is approximately 1007000 tons per year in 2009 we produced 902000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce the mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity of approximately 474000 tons per year as reported to the afpa in 2009 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 465000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces a range of basis weights from 35 lb to 96 lb 

 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest semichemical corrugating medium mills in the united states with an estimated production capacity of 581000 tons per year on three paper machines as reported to the afpa in april 2005 we completed the indefinite closure of our number three paper machine at tomahawk and currently operate the remaining two paper machines which have a combined production capacity of 516000 tons in 2009 we produced 526000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at tomahawk the tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

 

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated production capacity of 413000 tons on three paper machines as reported to the afpa in 2009 we produced 365000 tons of corrugating medium at filer city filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb to 47 lb 

 

we operate 68 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center six regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 68 manufacturing facilities 40 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 28 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers 

 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugated plant for the most part serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

 

timberland 

 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 91000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 15 years remaining on average 

 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold approximately 800000 acres of timberland we currently have in place supply agreements covering approximately 352000 of the 800000 acres sold the majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close proximity to our counce mill we currently hold an approximate 29 equity ownership interest in approximately 51000 acres owned by southern timber venture llc stv this acreage is located primarily in southern georgia and northern florida near our valdosta georgia mill and includes both timberlands and higher beneficial use properties 

 

our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 125000 acres by supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include about 115000 acres of timberland 

 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who serve local and regional accounts we also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the graphic design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

 

distribution 

 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments represent about 50 of the tons shipped and the remaining 50 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities 

 

our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage of corrugated products 

 

customers 

 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 9600 customers in over 17500 locations about twothirds of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across 

industries and geographic locations the remaining onethird of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

 

major raw materials used 

 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than our valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2009 with low recycled fiber prices our containerboard mills consumed approximately 636000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 189000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 447000 tons or 20 of pca’s total fiber requirements up from 17 in 2008 

 

energy supply energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process including black liquor these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility in recent history natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark during 2009 107 million mmbtu’s million btu’s or approximately 75 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 22 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 15 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 08 million mmbtu’s of oil 6 of the mills’ total purchased fuels our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately twothirds of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts 

 

pca’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2009 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 20 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

 

the following table shows pca’s purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2009 

 

 

approximately 40 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite our mills purchase approximately 8907000 ckwh hundred kilowatt hours annually or the equivalent of 30 million mmbtu’s pca’s corrugated products plants purchase about 2196000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 07 million mmbtu’s 

 

in october 2009 pca announced that it will undertake major energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills which are expected to significantly reduce fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and nearly eliminate fossil fuel consumption at these facilities the projects include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at the valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the counce mill the total capital expenditures for these projects are expected to be about 295 million to be spent over two years and the projects are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 

 

competition 

 

according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 625 us companies operating approximately 1340 plants most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our primary competitors include international paper company georgiapacific owned by koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation and templeinland inc however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company georgiapacific smurfitstone container corporation and templeinland inc as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 8000 employees approximately 2400 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5600 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

 

based on an agreement reached with the usw in august 2008 the existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering uswrepresented employees 89 of mill hourly workforce were extended five years with this extension the usw contracts at our mills are currently set to expire between september 2013 and june 2015 agreements with other union mill employees 11 of mill hourly workforce expire between june 2012 and october 2014 based on an agreement reached with the usw in april 2009 the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering usw represented employees was extended up to five years contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between march 2010 and december 2014 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

 

during 2009 we experienced no work stoppages and have experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the five years prior to 2009 we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

 

2 clean water act cwa 

 

3 clean air act caa 

 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2009 we spent approximately 264 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 235 million and 194 million respectively we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition total capital costs for environmental matters were 04 million for 2009 we currently estimate 2010 environmental capital expenditures will be 12 million 

 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2009 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately 32 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2009 we maintained an environmental reserve of 91 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 91 million reserve 45 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm as a part of the april 12 1999 transaction pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

 

as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 91 million accrued as of december 31 2009 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also 

provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources our energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011 while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

some of the statements in this report and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

 

industry risks 

 

industry earnings cyclicality — imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and corrugated products and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard and corrugated products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations 

competition — the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations 

 

the containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

 

company risks 

 

cost of fiber — an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings 

 

pca has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at three of our four mills on approximately 352000 acres of timberland in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

 

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants approximately 400000 to 450000 tons of recycled fiber per year the amount of recycled fiber purchased each year depends on the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber as the company attempts to minimize total fiber costs 

 

the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals — an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in recent years in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing have risen these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

 

material disruption of manufacturing — a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 

 

our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a number of events including unscheduled maintenance outages prolonged power failures an equipment failure explosion of a boiler labor difficulties natural catastrophes terrorism governmental regulations and other operational problems these events could lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters — pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 1 “business — environmental matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations which might require additional significant environmental expenditures 

 

investment risks 

 

market price of our common stock — the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline 

 

securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

 

general risks 

 

economic conditions — our earnings and cash generated from operations could be significantly lower if a severe downturn in the us economy occurs 

 

our operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the us economy and to a lesser extent by global economic conditions the significant downturn in the us economy began to impact our industry and pca in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued in 2009 lowering the demand for our products and our mill production this lower demand and production reduced our revenues increased our unit production costs and lowered our earnings and our cash generated from operations demand for our products and pca’s mill production improved during the second half of 2009 but it is uncertain if economic conditions will again deteriorate or continue to improve in the event that economic conditions deteriorate our operating and financial performance will be adversely impacted lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments and a prolonged and severe downturn could possibly impact our ability to comply with our debt covenants

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

 

overview 

 

pca is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states based on production capacity we operate four containerboard mills and 68 corrugated products manufacturing plants 

throughout the united states approximately 80 of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants the remaining 20 is sold to domestic customers or the export market we produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging 

 

in analyzing our operating performance we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results 

 

  

historically supply and demand as well as industrywide inventory levels have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products in addition to us shipments approximately 10 of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries 

 

the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the us economy the severe downturn in the economy began to significantly impact demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued in 2009 with industrywide corrugated products shipments down 77 in 2009 compared to 2008 the industry as well as pca began to see some improvement in demand as the economy improved for the year our corrugated products shipments were down only 46 compared to 2008 and steadily improved beginning in the second quarter of 2009 pca mills ran to demand during the year at 94 of capacity after taking over 150000 tons of downtime both market and maintenance related compared to 2008 our mill production was down almost 100000 tons industry supply and demand for containerboard was in balance and industry containerboard inventories at the end of december 2009 were 2139000 tons the lowest december inventory level since 1980 

 

prices for containerboard and corrugated products were lower during 2009 compared to 2008 with industry published prices for containerboard dropping 70 per ton from january 2009 through may 2009 prices dropped 60 per ton and prices dropped an additional 10 per ton in september 2009 containerboard prices subsequently increased in january 2010 with industry published prices up 50 per ton except for west coast shipments which increased 70 per ton 

 

lower pricing as well as lower demand resulting from the economic downturn negatively impacted pca’s 2009 earnings but these factors were partially offset by lower energy transportation and input costs our costs for purchased fuels averaged approximately 22 lower for the full year 2009 compared to 2008 while transportation costs decreased 12 from prior year levels electricity costs which typically lag fuel cost changes rose slightly on average in 2009 as producers tried to recoup 2008 fuel cost increases in the beginning of 2009 by the fourth quarter of 2009 electricity costs were below the prior year levels published recycled fiber costs decreased on average 44 compared to 2008 since the end of the year however recycled fiber costs have rebounded sharply and have more than doubled from the 2009 average wood fiber costs in 2009 were lower than they were in 2008 on average however in the fourth quarter poor weather conditions in the southern us made it difficult to access wood fiber driving wood costs to higher levels average chemical costs for full year 2009 were comparable to 2008 with costs being higher than the previous year in the first half of 2009 and lower in the second half of 2009 

 

our earnings for 2009 also benefitted from alternative fuel mixture tax credits which are fully described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the alternative fuel mixture tax credit expired on december 31 2009 

in the first quarter of 2010 we expect higher containerboard and box prices from announced price increases but most of the earnings benefit will not be realized until the second quarter when the price increase has been passed through to box customers we expect mill downtime and higher operating costs from our annual maintenance outage at counce and our valdosta mill outage for work related to our energy optimization project much higher recycled fiber costs higher energy costs associated with colder weather a higher effective tax rate and higher timingrelated benefit costs are also expected in the first quarter considering all these items we estimate our first quarter earnings will be lower than our fourth quarter earnings of 16 million which excludes net income of 44 million from alternative fuel mixture tax credits and a 1 million after tax charge from asset disposals related to the energy optimization projects 

 

results of operations 

 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 are set forth below 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

net sales decreased by 2129 million or 90 for the year ended december 31 2009 from the year ended december 31 2008 net sales decreased primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume 1455 million and decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 674 million 

 

total corrugated products volume sold decreased 46 to 289 billion square feet in 2009 compared to 303 billion square feet in 2008 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume decreased 38 in 2009 from 2008 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage decrease on a total shipments basis was due to the fact that 2009 had two fewer workdays 250 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2008 252 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 99 to 431000 tons for the year ended december 31 2009 from 478000 tons in 2008 outside sales of both corrugated products and containerboard began 2009 with significantly lower volumes compared to 2008 and steadily improved throughout the year 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations increased by 1107 million or 458 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2008 primarily attributable to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit of 1684 million described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements excluding the alternative fuel mixture tax credit income from operations decreased 578 million for full year 2009 which was primarily attributable to decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 674 million lower sales volume 525 million and increased labor and fringe benefit costs 80 million partially offset by decreased costs of energy 245 million transportation 237 million recycled fiber 189 million and wood fiber costs 35 million 

gross profit decreased 648 million or 132 for the year ended december 31 2009 from the year ended december 31 2008 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 208 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2008 to 199 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the decreases of sales prices and volume described previously 

 

selling and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged up 01 for the year ended december 31 2009 from the year ended december 31 2008 

 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 65 million or 106 from the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower salary and fringe benefit expenses 59 million and other items which were individually insignificant 

 

other expense net decreased 07 million or 47 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower legal related costs 16 million partially offset by increased fixed asset disposal costs 08 million 

 

interest expense net and income taxes 

 

interest expense net of interest income increased by 38 million or 120 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 due to lower interest rates on our investments which reduced interest income by 50 million in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

pca’s total effective tax rate was 161 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 355 for the year ended december 31 2008 the effective tax rate in 2009 varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of the alternative fuel mixture tax credit state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca had no material changes to its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” in 2009 

 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 are set forth below 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased by 445 million or 19 for the year ended december 31 2008 from the year ended december 31 2007 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 1110 million partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume 665 million 

 

total corrugated products volume sold decreased 29 to 303 billion square feet in 2008 compared to 312 billion square feet in 2007 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume decreased 33 in 2008 from 2007 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage decrease on a shipmentperworkday basis was due to the fact that 2008 had one more workday 252 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2007 251 days containerboard sales volume to external 

domestic and export customers decreased 117 to 478000 tons for the year ended december 31 2008 from 541000 tons in 2007 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations decreased by 517 million or 176 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease in income from operations was primarily attributable to increased energy and energy related costs including transportation 562 million lower sales volume 444 million increased costs for wood fiber 251 million labor 176 million medical 89 million bad debts 41 million legal matters 34 million startup costs of two major mill projects 32 million and fixed asset disposals 31 million the impact of higher costs and lower volume was partially offset by increased sales prices 1110 million and lower recycled fiber costs 36 million 

 

gross profit decreased 333 million or 63 for the year ended december 31 2008 from the year ended december 31 2007 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 227 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2007 to 208 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the cost increases and reduced sales volume described previously 

 

selling and administrative expenses increased 38 million or 22 for the year ended december 31 2008 from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily the result of higher expenses related to labor and fringe benefit costs 15 million warehousing costs due to customer requirements 15 million and travel meeting and entertainment expenses 05 million 

 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 48 million or 86 from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses 45 million 

 

other expense net increased 88 million or 1345 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily due to higher legal related costs 34 million fixed asset disposal costs 31 million storm damage to our facilities 10 million and a gain on sale of land occurring in 2007 08 million 

 

interest expense net and income taxes 

 

interest expense net of interest income increased by 61 million or 238 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the full year 2007 primarily as a result of lower interest income 62 million earned on pca’s cash equivalents and partially offset by lower interest expense 01 million related to pca’s outstanding debt balances the 62 million decrease in interest income was due both to lower interest income rates and lower cash balances during 2008 compared to 2007 the 01 million decrease in interest expense was due to a 24 million decrease in interest expense related to the company’s receivables credit facility due to lower interest rates and a 14 million decrease in term loan interest expense as a result of the repayment of the term loan in march 2008 this was almost completely offset by a 37 million increase in interest expense related to pca’s senior notes as a result of the issuance in march 2008 of the 6 1  2  notes due 2018 the proceeds of which were used to repay the 4 3  8  notes due august 2008 

 

pca’s effective tax rate was 355 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 365 for the year ended december 31 2007 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of state and local income taxes offset by the domestic manufacturers’ deduction the company had no material changes to its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 “income taxes” in 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 368 million or 137 to 3061 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 net income excluding income from alternative fuel mixture tax credits described in note 15 to the financial statements included in this report was 946 million for 2009 compared to 1356 million for 2008 a decrease of 410 million that reduced net cash provided by operating activities by the same amount this decrease however was more than offset by reduced operating cash requirements including a 484 million net reduction in federal tax payments after applying alternative fuel mixture tax credits during 2009 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 223 million additionally requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by 339 million in 2009 compared to 2008 driven for the most part by receivables and payables levels both of which were impacted by the economic downturn this was partially offset by higher pension contributions in 2009 cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca’s operating needs the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses and seasonal fluctuations in the company’s operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 308 million or 103 to 2693 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower net income in 2008 of 345 million partially offset by lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 15 million changes in balances of operating assets and liabilities reflected the ordinary course of operation of pca’s business during 2008 requirements for operating assets and liabilities are subject to pca’s operating needs the timing of collection of receivables and the payments of payables and expenses and to seasonal fluctuations in pca’s operations working capital requirements were affected by the weak business conditions and significantly lower than expected demand for containerboard and corrugated products during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting in a net increase in the requirements for accounts payable accrued liabilities and accounts receivable of 326 million for the three months ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 during 2008 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 894 million 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used for investing activities decreased 152 million or 113 to 1193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was due to lower additions to property plant and equipment of 188 million in 2009 compared to 2008 which was partially offset by a 31 million acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2009 as described in note 17 to the financial statements 

 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 213 million or 188 to 1345 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily related to higher additions to property plant and equipment of 195 million and higher additions to other long term assets of 14 million in the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 

 

as of december 31 2009 pca had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of 1981 million for 2010 including 1563 million for the major energy projects at its counce and valdosta 

mills pca believes that cashonhand combined with cash flow from operations and alternative fuel mixture credits receivable will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 755 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 1380 million or 647 compared to the same period in 2008 the difference was primarily attributable to lower debt payments of 1697 million in 2009 partially offset by 1452 million in net proceeds received from pca’s notes offering in 2008 described below additionally pca made no common stock repurchases in 2009 compared to 657 million in repurchases of pca common stock during 2008 and lower common stock dividends of 769 million paid in 2009 compared to 1251 million paid in 2008 

 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 2135 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 929 million or 770 from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to higher debt payments of 1602 million higher repurchases of pca common stock of 351 million 200 million in additional dividends paid on pca’s common stock and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of 219 million during 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by 1452 million in net proceeds received from pca’s notes offering  

 

in connection with the senior notes offering in march of 2008 pca received proceeds net of discount of 1499 million and paid 44 million for settlement of a treasury lock that it entered into to protect against increases in the tenyear us treasury rate which served as a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the notes pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of 03 million in connection with the senior notes offering pca used the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand to repay all of the 1500 million of outstanding 4 3  8  senior notes that were due on august 1 2008 

 

pca holds an approximate 29 equity ownership interest in stv pca did not receive any dividends from stv in 2009 2008 or 2007 

 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on april 15 2009 pca extended its receivables credit facility through april 14 2010 as of december 31 2009 1090 million was outstanding the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2009 was 1090 million 

 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3  8  senior notes due august 1 2008 and 4000 million of 5 3  4  senior notes due august 1 2013 on march 25 2008 pca issued 1500 million of 6 1  2  senior notes due march 15 2018 through a registered public offering the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand were used to repay all of the 1500 million of 4 3  8  senior notes which matured on august 1 2008 

 

on march 31 2008 pca repaid all borrowings under its old senior credit facility this facility was replaced with a senior credit facility that provides a new 1500 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit the new senior credit facility closed on april 15 2008 the new revolving credit facility is available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the new revolving credit facility will terminate in april 2013 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2009 

 

 

 

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 13 million at december 31 2009 and interest payments on debt outstanding based on interest rates in effect and longterm debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2009 projected contractual interest payments would be approximately 349 million in 2009 and for each future year for the purpose of this disclosure pca’s variable and fixed rate longterm debt would be replaced at maturity with similar longterm debt and similar interest rates this disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest rates see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the impact of changes in interest rates on pca’s future cash flows 

 

the operating lease commitments capital commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 see notes 8 and 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2010 see note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company’s expected payment for significant contractual obligations excludes 90 million of obligations for unrecognized tax benefits because the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for such liability see note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2009 pca had 1722 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities net of the impact on this borrowing capacity of 188 million of outstanding letters of credit currently pca’s primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2009 for pca’s revolving credit facility the receivables credit facility and the senior notes 

 

 

 

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 13 million at december 31 2009 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 228 million received in july 2003 and the noncash expense from the annual amortization of the 44 million paid in march 2008 to settle the treasury locks related to the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 and is included in interest expense net 

 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

 

  

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

 

in addition pca must maintain minimum net worth and maximum debt to total capitalization and minimum interest coverage ratios under the revolving credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness andor prohibit pca from drawing on the revolving credit facility such an acceleration may also constitute an event of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility at december 31 2009 pca was in compliance with these covenants 

 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 3000 million in 2010 including up to 2000 million for major energy optimization projects at its counce and valdosta mills the remaining 1000 million in expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves and alternative fuel mixture tax credit receivable and available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

 

pca is subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting the company are 

 

  

pca believes that it is currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition for the year ended december 31 2009 we spent approximately 264 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 235 million and 194 million respectively 

 

as is the case with any industrial operation pca has in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates former facilities and offsite facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances as part of the april 12 1999 transaction pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2009 remediation costs at pca’s mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2009 pca maintained an environmental reserve of 91 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters were 04 million for 2009 and the company currently estimates 2010 environmental capital expenditures will be 12 million as of this filing the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 91 million accrued as of december 31 2009 will have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and if so what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through caps taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities which may be material however climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged we currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark black liquor and biomass as fuel which are derived from renewable resources our energy optimization projects at the counce and valdosta linerboard mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011 while 

providing more efficient power generation at those facilities while we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of pca’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis pca evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes environmental liabilities stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

pca believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

pca evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources pca records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected for all other customers the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on its historical collection experience if the company’s collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations pca’s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 

 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on pca’s experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of its gross selling price accordingly the company reserves 10 of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

 

as of december 31 2009 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 39 million compared to 44 million at december 31 2008 bad debt expense in 2009 was 15 million compared to 42 million in 2008 the decrease in bad debt expense of 27 million was primarily attributable to a 14 million decrease in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and a recovery of 14 million from one customer that had previously filed for bankruptcy for the year ended december 31 2008 bad debt expense was 42 million compared to 01 million in 2007 the increase in bad debt expense of 41 million was primarily attributable to a 27 million increase in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and an increase of 11 million reserved for specific customers at the 90 level of their accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2008 

 

inventories 

 

pca records its inventories at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required raw materials 

work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 62 and 64 of inventories at current cost at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 715 “compensation — retirement benefits” 

 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

 

the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by pca based upon annual reviews 

 

for postretirement health care plan accounting pca reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

 

environmental liabilities 

 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under asc 410 “asset retirement and environmental obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however the company’s estimates may change pca believes that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on its financial statements 

 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

 

revenue recognition 

 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s 

goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

 

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

pca measures and records stockbased compensation cost in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” stock compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 the effective date of asc 718 and b compensation costs for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 the grant date fair value is estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 

 

pca recognizes compensation expense associated with option awards ratably over their vesting periods the company uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock the expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 

 

the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of pca’s common stock on the grant date the company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods as pca’s board of directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s retirement the company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age 

 

income taxes 

 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes for a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities see note 2 to pca’s consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in the report 

 

the interest rates on approximately 84 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 11 million annually in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure

controls and procedures 

 

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2009 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2009 

 

during the quarter ended december 31 2009 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 

principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 based on the specified criteria 

 

ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audited pca’s financial statements included in this form 10k has also audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting their attestation report precedes pca’s audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report

general 

 

packaging corporation of america we us our “pca” or the “company” is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states in terms of production capacity during 2008 we produced approximately 235 million tons of containerboard at our mills of which about 80 was consumed in pca’s corrugated products manufacturing plants 11 was sold to domestic customers and 9 was sold in the export market our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 303 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products our net sales to third parties totaled 24 billion in 2008 

 

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

 

 

 

in 2008 we produced 144 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 091 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 91000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements with third parties on approximately 359000 acres of timberland 

 

our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

 

industry overview 

 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was 26 billion in 2008 

 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2007 fibre box association annual report 

 

 

 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 630 companies and 1350 plants 

 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce 

corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required and shipped to converters 

 

pca operations and products 

 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 20 lb to 47 lb mill capacities described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper basis weights all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

 

the following four paragraphs describe our containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum capacity 2008 actual production and production capabilities 

 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest kraft linerboard mills in the united states its estimated production capacity as reported to the american forest and paper association “afpa” is approximately 1007000 tons per year in 2008 we produced 970000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce the mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard 

 

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity of approximately 474000 tons per year as reported to the afpa in 2008 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 474000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 35 lb to 96 lb 

 

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest semichemical corrugating medium mills in the united states with an estimated production capacity of 581000 tons per year on three paper machines as reported to the afpa in april 2005 we completed the indefinite closure of our number three paper machine at tomahawk and currently operate the remaining two paper machines which have a combined production capacity of 516000 tons in 2008 we produced 502000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at tomahawk one of the two paper machines we operate is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world the tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 47 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium 

 

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated production capacity of 413000 tons on three paper machines as reported to the afpa in 2008 we produced 407000 tons of corrugating medium at filer city filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb to 47 lb 

 

we operate 67 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center five regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 67 manufacturing facilities 40 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 27 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers 

 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugated plant for the most part serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

 

timberland 

 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 91000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining on average 

 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold approximately 800000 acres of timberland we currently have in place supply agreements covering approximately 359000 of the 800000 acres sold the majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close proximity to our counce mill we currently hold an approximate 29 equity ownership interest in approximately 51000 acres owned by southern timber venture llc stv this acreage is located primarily in southern georgia and northern florida near our valdosta georgia mill and includes both timberlands and higher beneficial use properties 

 

in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 125000 acres by supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include over 145000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest approximately 80000 cords of wood from these forests annually 

 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

 

solid wood facilities 

 

we own and operate one sawmill located in ackerman mississippi during 2008 the ackerman sawmill sold 51 million board feet of lumber used in the building products and furniture industries we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who serve local and regional accounts we also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the graphic design centers general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

 

distribution 

 

our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments represent about 55 to 60 of the tons shipped and the remaining 40 to 45 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we use thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage 

 

customers 

 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 9600 customers in over 17500 locations about twothirds of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining onethird of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

 

major raw materials used 

 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than our valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2008 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 590000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 195000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 395000 tons or 17 of pca’s total fiber requirements 

 

energy supply energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility in recent history natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark during 2008 117 million mmbtu’s million btu’s or approximately 75 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 25 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 16 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 10 million mmbtu’s of oil 7 of the mills’ total purchased fuels our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate more than twothirds of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts 

 

pca’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2008 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 20 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

the following table shows pca’s purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2008 

 

 

 

approximately 40 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite our mills purchase approximately 9445000 ckwh hundred kilowatt hours annually or the equivalent of 32 million mmbtu’s pca’s corrugated products plants purchase about 2290000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 08 million mmbtu’s 

 

competition 

 

according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 630 us companies operating approximately 1350 plants most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include international paper company koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation and templeinland inc however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we also compete with the smaller independent converters 

 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation and templeinland inc as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 8100 employees approximately 2400 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5700 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel 

workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

 

based on an agreement reached with the usw in august 2008 the existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering uswrepresented employees 91 of mill hourly workforce were extended five years with this extension the usw contracts at our mills are currently set to expire between september 2013 and june 2015 agreements with other union mill employees 9 of mill hourly workforce expire between october 2009 and june 2012 contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between february 2009 and november 2014 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

 

during 2008 we experienced no work stoppages and have experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the five years prior to 2008 we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees 

 

environmental matters 

 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

 

2 clean water act cwa 

 

3 clean air act caa 

 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2008 we spent approximately 235 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 194 million and 175 million respectively we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

 

in 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized a clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster rule the cluster rules govern allowable discharges of air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations as a result pca and its competitors were required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these rules we completed all of our projects related to cluster rule requirements in 2006 and as a result do not anticipate any further capital expenditures related to ensuring compliance with the cluster rules from 1997 through 2006 we spent approximately 392 million to ensure compliance with the cluster rule requirements total capital costs for environmental matters were 35 million for 2008 we currently estimate 2009 environmental capital expenditures will be 15 million 

 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2008 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately 32 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2008 we maintained an environmental reserve of 83 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 83 million reserve 42 million is reserved for our landfill 

obligations which are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm as a part of the april 12 1999 transaction pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

 

as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 83 million accrued as of december 31 2008 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

industry risks 

 

industry earnings cyclicality — imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and corrugated products and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions which severely weakened during the fourth quarter of 2008 if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard and corrugated products could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations 

 

competition — the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations 

 

the containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

 

company risks 

 

cost of fiber — an increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings 

 

pca has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at three of our four mills on approximately 359000 acres of timberland in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

 

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants approximately 395000 tons of recycled fiber per year 

 

the market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future which could result in lower or volatile earnings 

 

cost of purchased energy and chemicals — an increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in recent years in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing have risen these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy and chemical prices rise our production costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

material disruption of manufacturing — a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 

 

our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities particularly at our mills any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within such facilities could cease operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a number of events including unscheduled maintenance outages prolonged power failures an equipment failure explosion of a boiler labor difficulties natural catastrophes terrorism governmental regulations and other operational problems these events could lead to higher costs and reduced earnings 

 

environmental matters — pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws see item 1 “business — environmental matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years although we have established reserves to provide for future environmental liability these reserves may not be adequate in addition enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant expenditures 

 

investment risks 

 

market price of our common stock — the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline 

 

securities markets worldwide have recently experienced significant price declines and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 

 

general risks 

 

economic conditions — our earnings and cash generated from operations could be significantly lower as a result of the severe and possibly prolonged downturn in the us economy 

 

our operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the us economy and to a lesser extent by global economic conditions the significant downturn in the us economy during the fourth quarter of 2008 significantly lowered the demand for our products as a result to balance the production of containerboard at our mills with demand we reduced our fourth quarter mill production by 90000 tons and operated our mills at about 85 of capacity this lower demand and production reduced our revenues increased our unit production costs and lowered our earnings and our cash generated from operations it is uncertain if economic conditions will deteriorate further or when economic conditions will improve until economic conditions improve our operating and financial performance will continue to be adversely impacted lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our ability to fund operations capital requirements and common stock dividend payments and a prolonged and severe downturn could possibly impact our ability to comply with our debt convenants

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

 

overview 

 

pca is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states based on production capacity we operate four containerboard mills and 67 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the united states approximately 80 of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants the remaining 20 is sold to domestic customers or the export market we produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also 

have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging 

 

in analyzing our operating performance we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results 

 

  

the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the us economy historically supply and demand as well as industrywide inventory levels have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products in addition to us shipments approximately 10 of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries 

 

the us economy experienced a severe downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 and as a result reported industry shipments of corrugated products decreased 10 for this period compared to 2007 during this same period reported industry containerboard production levels decreased 14 from fourth quarter of 2007 levels the total industry reported containerboard mill production for december was the lowest monthly production in over 15 years as reported by industry publications linerboard prices decreased 10 per ton and corrugating medium prices decreased 20 per ton in december 2008 and additional price decreases of 10 per ton for both linerboard and corrugating medium were reported by industry publications in both january and february 2009 average prices for linerboard and corrugating medium ended 2008 at 45 per ton and 35 per ton respectively higher than december 2007 levels reflecting the july 2008 55 per ton increase partially offset by the december pricing decline 

 

the cost to manufacture containerboard is dependent in large part on the costs of wood fiber recycled fiber purchased fuels electricity labor and fringe benefits while energy and other costs are significant in the manufacture of corrugated products labor and fringe benefits make up the largest component of corrugated products’ manufactured costs besides the cost of containerboard 

 

our costs for purchased fuels averaged approximately 30 higher for the full year 2008 compared to 2007 while transportation and electricity costs rose more modestly from prior year levels recycled fiber costs in 2008 were lower than in 2007 and at the end of 2008 were about 75 below yearend 2007 levels wood fiber costs in 2008 were higher than they were in 2007 and at the end of 2008 about 5 higher than they were in december 2007 chemical costs were also higher during 2008 compared to 2007 this was particularly significant in the second half of 2008 and is expected to continue into at least the first part of 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 pca’s earnings were negatively impacted by increased costs during the first three quarters and by the severe economic downturn in the fourth quarter for the full year 2008 earnings were approximately 20 below the record earnings level set in 2007 but still represented our second highest earnings for a fiscal year excluding special items since becoming a standalone company in april 1999 the reduction in earnings was primarily driven by decreased sales volume for both containerboard and corrugated products fourth quarter corrugated products sales volume was down 99 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 and market related downtime and machine slowbacks reduced mill production by 90000 tons this downtime was the most downtime our mills have taken in a quarter since becoming a standalone company sales prices rose compared to 2007 with the implementation of the containerboard price increase in july 2008 and the corresponding corrugated products price increases partially offsetting the beneficial impact of the price increases were cost increases mentioned previously in energy chemicals and wood fiber in addition to higher labor and fringe benefits costs including medical costs 

 

in the first quarter 2009 our valdosta mill will be down for its annual maintenance outage and in addition market related downtime is likely energy usage will be higher with colder weather and we also 

expect higher chemical costs considering these items and with the current economic conditions and uncertainty we expect our first quarter 2009 earnings to be lower than our earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

results of operations 

 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 are set forth below 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased by 445 million or 19 for the year ended december 31 2008 from the year ended december 31 2007 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard 1110 million partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume 665 million 

 

total corrugated products volume sold decreased 29 to 303 billion square feet in 2008 compared to 312 billion square feet in 2007 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume decreased 33 in 2008 from 2007 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage decrease on a shipmentperworkday basis was due to the fact that 2008 had one more workday 252 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2007 251 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 117 to 478000 tons for the year ended december 31 2008 from 541000 tons in 2007 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations decreased by 517 million or 176 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease in income from operations was primarily attributable to increased energy and energy related costs including transportation 562 million lower sales volume 444 million increased costs for wood fiber 251 million labor 176 million medical 89 million bad debts 41 million legal matters 34 million startup costs of two major mill projects 32 million and fixed asset disposals 31 million the impact of higher costs and lower volume was partially offset by increased sales prices 1110 million and lower recycled fiber costs 36 million 

 

gross profit decreased 333 million or 63 for the year ended december 31 2008 from the year ended december 31 2007 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 227 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2007 to 208 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the cost increases and reduced sales volume described previously 

 

selling and administrative expenses increased 38 million or 22 for the year ended december 31 2008 from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily the result of higher expenses related 

to labor and fringe benefit costs 15 million warehousing costs due to customer requirements 15 million and travel meeting and entertainment expenses 05 million 

 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 48 million or 86 from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses 45 million 

 

other expense net increased 88 million or 1345 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily due to higher legal related costs 34 million fixed asset disposal costs 31 million storm damage to our facilities 10 million and a gain on sale of land occurring in 2007 08 million 

 

interest expense net and income taxes 

 

interest expense net of interest income increased by 61 million or 238 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily as a result of lower interest income 62 million earned on pca’s cash equivalents partially offset by lower interest expense 01 million related to pca’s outstanding debt balances the 62 million decrease in interest income was due both to lower interest income rates and lower cash balances during 2008 compared to 2007 the 01 million decrease in interest expense was due to a 24 million decrease in interest expense related to the company’s receivables credit facility due to lower interest rates and a 14 million decrease in term loan interest expense as a result of the repayment of the term loan in march 2008 this was almost completely offset by a 37 million increase in interest expense related to the issuance in march 2008 of pca’s 6 1  2  notes due 2018 the proceeds of which were used to repay the 4 3  8  notes due august 2008 

 

pca’s effective tax rate was 355 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 365 for the year ended december 31 2007 the effective tax rate varies from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 principally due to the impact of state and local income taxes offset by the domestic manufacturers’ deduction pca had no material changes impacting fin no 48 in 2008 

 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 are set forth below 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased by 1290 million or 59 for the year ended december 31 2007 from the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 1231 million of the increase resulted from higher sales prices and approximately 59 million of the increase resulted from higher sales volumes 

 

the increased sales prices resulted from the august 2007 increase in containerboard prices and the realization of those price increases in our sales of corrugated products 

total corrugated products volume sold decreased 03 to 312 billion square feet in 2007 compared to 313 billion square feet in 2006 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume decreased 11 in 2007 from 2006 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage decrease on a shipmentperworkday basis was due to the fact that 2007 had two more workdays 251 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2006 249 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 123 to 541000 tons for the year ended december 31 2007 from 482000 tons in 2006 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations increased by 676 million or 299 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volume 1201 million partially offset by increased costs for recycled fiber 168 million wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel 168 million medical pension benefit and incentive costs 63 million transportation costs 54 million wood fiber costs 31 million and the impact of a fourth quarter 2007 unplanned outage at the counce tennessee linerboard mill 50 million net of insurance recovery 

 

gross profit increased 811 million or 183 for the year ended december 31 2007 from the year ended december 31 2006 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 203 of net sales in 2006 to 227 of net sales in the current year primarily due to the increased sales prices described previously 

 

selling and administrative expenses increased 106 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2007 from the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense 63 million and related fringe benefit costs 17 million increased travel and entertainment expenses 11 million and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements 08 million 

 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 44 million or 87 from the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to higher salary incentive and related benefit expenses 28 million and increased information technology infrastructure costs 12 million 

 

other expense net decreased 05 million or 55 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease was primarily due to a 08 million gain on the sale of land in the third quarter and other individually insignificant items 

 

interest expense net and income taxes 

 

interest expense net of interest income decreased by 56 million or 180 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily as a result of increased income earned on pca’s cash equivalents due to higher cash balances 

 

pca’s effective tax rate was 365 for the year ended december 31 2007 and 358 for the year ended december 31 2006 for both 2007 and 2006 tax rates were higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due principally to state income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 308 million or 103 to 2693 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower net income in 2008 of 345 million as previously described partially offset by lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 15 million during 2008 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 894 million or 425 of book income before taxes of 2101 million compared to pca’s effective tax rate of 355 in 2008 

 

the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities were driven by favorable year over year changes in accounts receivable 337 million and inventories 59 million and lower 2008 pension contributions 121 million partially offset by unfavorable year over year changes in accounts payable 439 million and accrued liabilities 105 million the higher pension contributions in 2007 were driven in part by expected additional funding requirements beginning in 2008 changes in balances of operating assets and liabilities reflected the ordinary course operation of pca’s business during 2008 requirements for operating assets and liabilities are subject to pca’s operating needs the timing of collection of receivables and the payments of payables and expenses and to seasonal fluctuations in pca’s operations working capital requirements were affected by the weak business conditions and significantly lower than expected demand for containerboard and corrugated products during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting in a net increase in the requirements for accounts payable accrued liabilities and accounts receivable of 326 million for the three months ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 535 million or 217 to 3001 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net income in 2007 as previously described and lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 35 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 during 2007 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 1055 million or 394 of book income before taxes of 2679 million compared to pca’s effective tax rate of 365 in 2007 

 

requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by 35 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily driven by favorable yearoveryear changes in accounts receivable 353 million and accounts payable 206 million partially offset by unfavorable yearoveryear changes in accrued liabilities 326 million inventories 50 million and higher 2007 pension contributions 121 million 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 213 million or 188 to 1345 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily related to higher additions to property plant and equipment of 195 million and higher additions to other long term assets of 14 million in the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 192 million or 205 to 1132 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily related to higher additions to property plant and equipment of 252 million in 2007 compared to 2006 partially offset by the cost of acquisitions in 2006 of 43 million and lower additions to other long term assets of 24 million 

 

as of december 31 2008 pca had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of 430 million for 2009 pca believes cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments

net cash used for financing activities totaled 2135 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 929 million or 770 from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to higher debt payments of 1602 million higher repurchases of pca common stock of 351 million 200 million in additional dividends paid on pca’s common stock and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of 219 million during 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by 1452 million in net proceeds received from pca’s notes offering described below 

 

in connection with the senior notes offering in march of 2008 pca received proceeds net of discount of 1499 million and paid 44 million for settlement of a treasury lock that it entered into to protect against increases in the tenyear us treasury rate which served as a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the notes pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of 03 million in connection with the senior notes offering pca used the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand to repay all of the 1500 million of outstanding 4 3  8  senior notes that were due on august 1 2008 

 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 1207 million for the year ended december 31 2007 an increase of 171 million or 166 from the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to 305 million in repurchases of pca common stock in 2007 partially offset by additional proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of 144 million during 2007 compared to 2006 

 

pca holds an approximate 29 equity ownership interest in stv pca did not receive any dividends from stv in 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on september 19 2008 pca extended its receivables credit facility through september 18 2009 as of december 31 2008 1090 million was outstanding and 410 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2008 was 1090 million 

 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3  8  senior notes due august 1 2008 and 4000 million of 5 3  4  senior notes due august 1 2013 on march 25 2008 pca issued 1500 million of 6 1  2  senior notes due march 15 2018 through a registered public offering the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand were used to repay all of the 1500 million of 4 3  8  senior notes which matured on august 1 2008 

on march 31 2008 pca repaid all borrowings under its old senior credit facility this facility was replaced with a senior credit facility that provides a new 1500 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit the new senior credit facility closed on april 15 2008 the new revolving credit facility is available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the new revolving credit facility will terminate in april 2013 as of december 31 2008 pca had 1306 million in unused borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility net of the impact on this borrowing capacity of 194 million of outstanding letters of credit 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2008 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2008 

 

 

 

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 16 million at december 31 2008 and interest payments on debt outstanding based on interest rates in effect and longterm debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2008 projected contractual interest payments would be approximately 360 million in 2009 and for each future year for the purpose of this disclosure pca’s variable and fixed rate longterm debt would be replaced at maturity with similar longterm debt and similar interest rates this disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest rates see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the impact of changes in interest rates on pca’s future cash flows 

 

the operating lease commitments capital commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 see notes 8 and 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2009 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company’s expected payment for significant contractual obligations excludes 104 million of obligations for unrecognized tax benefits because the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for such liability see note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2008 pca had 1716 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities net of the 

impact on this borrowing capacity of 194 million of outstanding letters of credit currently pca’s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2008 for pca’s revolving credit facility the receivables credit facility and the senior notes 

 

 

 

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 16 million at december 31 2008 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 228 million received in july 2003 and the noncash expense from the annual amortization of the 44 million paid in march 2008 to settle the treasury locks related to the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the 5 3  4  senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1  2  senior notes due 2018 and is included in interest expense net 

 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

 

  

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

 

in addition we must maintain minimum net worth and maximum debt to total capitalization and minimum interest coverage ratios under the revolving credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness andor prohibit us from drawing on the revolving credit facility such a default may also constitute an event of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility at december 31 2008 pca was in compliance with these covenants 

 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 900 million in 2009 these expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves and available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

 

  

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition for the year ended december 31 2008 we spent approximately 235 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 194 million and 175 million respectively 

 

in addition the cluster rules govern allowable discharges of air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk mills we have completed all of our projects to ensure compliance with the cluster rules and as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future expenditures related to cluster rule compliance will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances under the terms of the contribution agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2008 remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2008 we maintained an environmental reserve of 83 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters were 35 million for 2008 and we currently estimate 2009 environmental capital expenditures will be 15 million as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 83 million accrued as of december 31 2008 will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses 

and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories goodwill and intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes environmental liabilities stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

accounts receivable — allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to us to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 03 for amounts less than 90 days past due their contractual terms and 30 for amounts more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based on our historical collection experience if our collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 

 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on our experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of our gross selling price accordingly we reserve 10 of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

 

as of december 31 2008 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 44 million compared to 29 million at december 31 2007 bad debt expense in 2008 was 42 million compared to 01 million in 2007 the increase in bad debt expense of 41 million was primarily attributable to a 27 million increase in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and an increase of 11 million reserved for specific customers at the 90 level of their accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2008 for the year ended december 31 2007 bad debt expense was 01 million compared to 32 million in 2006 the decrease of 31 million was primarily attributable to a 18 million decrease in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and a decrease of 09 million in connection with specific customers that were reserved for at the 90 level of their accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2007 

 

inventories 

 

we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 64 of inventories at current cost at both december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for 

postretirement benefits other than pensions” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” 

 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

 

the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by us based upon annual reviews 

 

for postretirement health care plan accounting we review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

 

environmental liabilities 

 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however our estimates may change we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

 

revenue recognition 

 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

 

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired 

an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

pca measures and records stockbased compensation cost in accordance with sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” stock compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 the effective date of sfas no 123r based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r 

 

pca recognizes compensation expense associated with option awards ratably over their vesting periods the company uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock the expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 

 

the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of pca’s common stock on the grant date the company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods as pca’s board of directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s retirement the company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age 

 

income taxes 

 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on pca’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes on january 17 2008 in connection with a contemplated issuance of tenyear debt securities in march 2008 pca entered into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty to lock in the then current interest rate on tenyear us treasury notes to protect against increases in the tenyear us treasury note rate this rate served as a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the tenyear notes due 2018 issued in march 2008 as a result of a decrease in the interest rate on the tenyear us treasury notes between the date of the agreement and the time pca priced its offering of those notes pca paid 44 million to the counterparty on march 25 2008 the date of settlement as of december 31 2008 pca was not a party to any derivative instruments 

 

the interest rates on approximately 84 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 11 million annually in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend  

controls and procedures 

 

pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca’s filings under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

prior to filing this report pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca’s management including pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2008 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report based on this evaluation pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2008 

 

during the quarter ended december 31 2008 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 based on the specified criteria

industry overview 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was 247 billion in 2006 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2005 fibre box association annual report 

 

  

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 635 companies and 1360 plants 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required by converters and shipped to them 

pca operations and products 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb to 47 lb all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

the following four paragraphs describe our four containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum capacity 2006 actual production and production capabilities 

counce   our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the united states its production capacity is approximately 991000 tons per year in 2006 we produced 1009000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce our actual production at counce in 2006 exceeded the mill’s capacity due to a production mix consisting of a lower percentage of lightweight linerboard the mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard

valdosta   our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 472000 tons per year in 2006 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 478000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta’s actual production slightly exceeded its capacity due to a lower percentage of lightweight linerboard productionvaldosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb to 90 lb

tomahawk   our tomahawk wisconsin mill is one of the largest corrugating medium mills in the united states with production capacity of 580000 tons per year on three paper machines in april 2005 we completed the indefinite closure of our number three paper machine at tomahawk and currently operate the remaining two paper machines which have a combined production capacity of 515000 tons in 2006 we produced 519000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at tomahawk one of the two paper machines we operate our number four paper machine is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world the tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 40 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium

filer city   our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill with a production capacity of 405000 tons on three paper machines in 2006 we produced 397000 tons of corrugating medium at filer city filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb to 40 lb

we operate 68 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center five regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 68 manufacturing facilities 40 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 28 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers the five graphic design centers are located in fairfield ohio dallas texas cranbury new jersey salisbury north carolina and south gate california 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugator plant for the most part serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugator plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 106000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining on average 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold about 800000 acres of timberland as part of the timberland sale agreements we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600000 acres of the total acres sold in 2005 the supply agreement related to our valdosta mill on approximately 200000 acres was terminated through a mutual agreement because lower cost pulpwood was available in closer proximity to the mill we currently hold a 31 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in approximately 52000 acres owned by southern timber venture llc stv this acreage is located primarily in southern georgia and northern florida near our valdosta georgia mill and includes both timberlands and higher beneficial use hbu properties we currently have in place supply agreements covering about 380000 of the 800000 acres sold the majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close proximity to our counce mill

in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 125000 acres by 

supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include over 210000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest approximately 80000 cords of wood from these forests annually 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

solid wood facilities 

on november 16 2006 we sold our fulton mississippi sawmill in 2006 through the date of the sale of the facility the sawmill produced and sold 11 million board feet of lumber with net sales of 57 million 

the remaining sawmill that we owned and operated in 2006 is located in ackerman mississippi during 2006 the ackerman sawmill sold 99 million board feet of lumber used in the building products and furniture industries we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who serve local and regional accounts we also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize support personnel that are new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugated plants as well as the graphic design centers 

distribution 

our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments represent about 60 to 65 of the tons shipped and the remaining 35 to 40 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we do use some thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage 

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 9100 customers in over 16500 locations about 70 of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply   fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources all of our mills other than our valdosta mill can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2006 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 614000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 212000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 402000 tons or 17 of pca’s total fiber requirements

energy supply   energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility in recent history natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark during 2006 115 million mmbtu’s million btu’s or approximately 73 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 20 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 13 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 19 million mmbtu’s of oil 12 of the mills’ total purchased fuels our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately twothirds of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts

pca’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2006 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 21 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

the following table shows pca’s purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2006 

 

  

approximately 42 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite our mills purchase approximately 9230000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 32 million mmbtu’s pca’s corrugated products plants purchase about 2400000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 08 million mmbtu’s 

competition 

according to industry sources corrugated products are produced by about 635 us companies operating approximately 1360 plants most corrugated products are custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include international paper company koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we believe we compete as much with the smaller independent converters as with the larger integrated producers 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 8300 employees approximately 2300 of these employees were salaried and approximately 6000 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented primarily by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

contracts for unionized employees at our containerboard mills expire between june 2007 and june 2012 contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between march 2007 and november 2012 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

during 2006 we experienced no work stoppages in 2001 we experienced a onemonth strike at our filer city mill with the usw the strike was settled and the mill’s current agreement expires in april 2009 prior to this incident we and our predecessors had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years we believe we have satisfactory employment relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

2 clean water act cwa 

3 clean air act caa 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2006 we spent approximately 175 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 158 million and 151 million respectively we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

in april 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized a new clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster rules which govern all pulp and paper mill operations including those at our mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants as a result pca and its competitors are required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules during 2006 we spent 11 million to complete our projects related to cluster rule requirements at our four mills as a result we do not anticipate any further capital expenditures related to ensuring compliance with the cluster rules from 1997 through 2006 we spent approximately 392 million on cluster rule compliance to meet clean air act requirements total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 48 million for 2006 we currently estimate 2007 environmental capital expenditures will be 86 million  

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2006 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 32 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2006 we maintained an environmental reserve of 61 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 61 million reserve 35 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

as a part of the april 12 1999 transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 61 million accrued as of december 31 2006 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors 

some of the statements in this report and in our 2006 annual report to stockholders and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

industry risks 

industry earnings cyclicality —imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash flow 

from time to time we have taken downtime or slowbacks at some of our mills to balance our production of containerboard with the market demand for our containerboard and we may continue to do so in the future some of our competitors have also temporarily closed or reduced production at their 

containerboard mills some of which could reopen and increase production capacity this could result in a supply and demand imbalance and cause prices to fall 

competition —the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry combined with the commodity nature of containerboard could result in downward pressure on pricing which could lower earnings 

pca operates in an industry that is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to price fluctuations as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of containerboard competition and the commodity nature of containerboard plus the intensity of corrugated packaging competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings 

company risks 

cost of wood fiber —dependence on external wood fiber sources could lead to higher costs and lower earnings for pca 

pca has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at three of our four mills on about 380000 acres of timberland in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

because we do not own any timberlands we are more vulnerable to changes in availability of wood fiber in areas adjacent to our mills than those of our competitors who do own timberlands in areas adjacent to their mills and therefore could face higher wood fiber costs than those competitors both in terms of the cost of the wood fiber itself as well as the transportation costs to get the wood fiber to our mills the price for wood fiber has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control including environmental and conservation regulations natural disasters and the weather 

any increase in wood fiber costs could cause our manufacturing costs to increase and our earnings to decrease to a greater extent than those of our competitors who own their own timberlands 

cost of recycled fiber —an increase in the cost of recycled fiber could increase our containerboard manufacturing costs and lower our earnings 

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants approximately 400000 tons of recycled fiber per year 

the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility periods of above average recycled fiber costs and overall price volatility may continue which could result in earnings volatility 

cost of purchased energy —an increase in the cost of purchased energy particularly natural gas and oil could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in recent years these fluctuations impact 

our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy prices rise our production costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters —pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws in our 2006 annual report on form 10k under the caption “environmental matters” we provide certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years although we have established reserves to provide for future environmental liability these reserves may not be adequate 

restrictions imposed by our senior credit facility the receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes — our operating flexibility is limited in certain respects by the covenants in our senior credit facility the receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes

our senior credit facility receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes impose restrictions on us that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and industry specifically these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions and

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

investment risks 

potential impediments to a change of control —some of the provisions of our charter documents and the presence of a large stockholder could discourage acquisition proposals by third parties and could delay deter or prevent a change in control 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors subject to any limitations prescribed by law to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval the issuance of preferred stock while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock the presence of a significant stockholder may also deter a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of pca even if that might be favorable to pca or pca’s other stockholders 

market price of our common stock — the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 




 item 1 b   unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2   properties 

the table below provides a summary of our containerboard mills the principal products produced and each mill’s annual practical maximum capacity based upon all of our paper machines’ production capabilities 

 

   in april 2005 we shut down our number three paper machine at our tomahawk mill after resuming operations on our number one paper machine at our filer city mill shutting down the number three machine out of 3 total at tomahawk reduces our total productive capacity by 65000 tons at tomahawk from 580000 tons to 515000 tons and reduces our total containerboard mill system capacity from 2448000 tons to 2383000 tons this action was based on market conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or productivity levels change going forward

we currently own our four containerboard mills and 45 of our corrugated manufacturing operations 37 corrugated plants and eight sheet plants we also own one sawmill an airdrying yard one warehouse and miscellaneous other property which includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices these sales offices and woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative offices pca leases the space for three corrugated plants 20 sheet plants five regional design centers and numerous other distribution centers warehouses and facilities the equipment in these leased facilities is in virtually all cases owned by pca except for forklifts and other rolling stock which are generally leased 

we lease the cutting rights to approximately 106000 acres of timberland located near our valdosta mill 85000 acres and our counce mill 21000 acres most of these cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining on average 

we currently lease space for our corporate headquarters in lake forest illinois the lease for the lake forest illinois facility is a short term facility use agreement lease with automatic renewal rights specifically this lease is a continuous monthtomonth lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling either party the right to terminate the lease with at least 8 months notice we currently believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

pca is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

pca is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states based on production capacity approximately 80 of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants the remaining 20 is sold to domestic customers or the export market besides containerboard we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging our operating facilities and customers are located primarily in the united states 

in analyzing our operating performance we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results 

·   corrugated products demand

·   corrugated products and containerboard pricing

·   containerboard inventories and

·   cost trends and volatility for our major costs including wood and recycled fiber purchased fuels electricity labor and fringe benefits and transportation costs

the market for containerboard is generally subject to changes in the us economy historically supply and demand as well as industrywide inventory levels have influenced prices of containerboard in addition to us shipments approximately 10 of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries 

industry supply and demand trends were favorable throughout 2006 industry shipments of corrugated products increased 13 during 2006 compared to 2005 on a per workday basis during this same period industry containerboard inventory levels remained at historically low levels with inventory at the end of december 2006 at its second lowest level in the past 25 years on a weeks of supply basis since september 2005 linerboard prices have increased 120 per ton or approximately 30 as reported by industry publications 

the cost to manufacture containerboard is dependent in large part on the costs of wood fiber recycled fiber purchased fuels electricity labor and fringe benefits while energy and other costs are significant in the manufacture of corrugated products labor and fringe benefits make up the largest component of corrugated products’ manufactured costs besides the cost of containerboard 

costs for purchased fuels rose sharply in the fourth quarter of 2005 and have remained above the average levels of 2005 but not as high as the fourth quarter of 2005 transportation and electricity costs have also risen due to higher fuel costs recycled fiber costs began the year below the prior year’s levels increased through the third quarter and ended the year about 20 above yearend 2005 levels wood fiber costs did not change appreciably compared to 2005 

for the year ended december 31 2006 pca achieved significantly improved earnings compared to the prior year the improved earnings were primarily driven by increased product pricing for both containerboard and corrugated products reflecting the full realization of previously announced price increases and an improvement in product and customer sales mix product sales volumes remained steady throughout the year and were 08 above our last year’s alltime record volume on a per workday basis partially offsetting the earnings improvement were higher transportation costs driven for the most part by fuel price increases higher labor and fringe benefits costs including medical pension and incentive compensation costs and higher energy costs due to increases in fuel and electricity prices 

we expect our earnings in the first quarter 2007 to be lower than our earnings in the fourth quarter 2006 primarily due to planned mill maintenance outages at our linerboard mills in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia we also typically incur higher energy costs in the first quarter due to increased colder weather and somewhat higher fiber costs related to more difficult logging conditions

net sales 

net sales increased by 1934 million or 97 for the year ended december 31 2006 from the year ended december 31 2005 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes of corrugated products and containerboard compared to 2005 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 04 to 313 billion square feet in 2006 compared to 312 billion square feet in 2005 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 08 in 2006 from 2005 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase on a shipmentperworkday basis was due to the fact that 2006 had one less workday 249 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2005 250 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 156 to 482000 tons for the year ended december 31 2006 from 417000 tons in 2005 

income from operations 

income from operations increased by 1098 million or 946 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 2005 included in income from operations for the year ended december 31 2005 is income of 140 million net of expenses consisting of two dividends paid to pca by southern timber venture llc stv the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a 31 1 ¤ 3  ownership interest

excluding the dividends from stv income from operations increased 1238 million in 2006 compared to 2005 the 1238 million increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volume as well as improved mix of business 1956 million partially offset by increased costs related to transportation 189 million energy primarily purchased fuels and electricity 183 million wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel 169 million medical pension and other benefit costs 99 million and incentive compensation 65 million 

gross profit increased 1371 million or 447 for the year ended december 31 2006 from the year ended december 31 2005 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 154 of net sales in 2005 to 203 of net sales in the current year primarily due to the increased sales prices described previously 

selling and administrative expenses increased 123 million or 84 for the year ended december 31 2006 from the comparable period in 2005 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and 

incentive compensation expense 82 million and related fringe benefit costs 14 million and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements 20 million 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 31 million or 65 from the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation expense 26 million and other increased costs which were not individually significant 

other expense net decreased 21 million or 201 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a 31 million decrease in expenses related to the disposals of property plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in connection with capital projects partially offsetting the decrease in fixed asset disposal expense was higher legal expenses 05 million and increased losses on disposals of storeroom items 04 million 

interest expense net and income taxes 

interest expense net of interest income increased by 31 million or 111 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the full year 2005 primarily as a result of higher interest expense on our variable rate debt due to higher interest rates 

pca’s effective tax rate was 358 for the year ended december 31 2006 and 402 for the year ended december 31 2005 the lower tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to a larger domestic manufacturer’s deduction and a reduction in the texas state tax rate for both years 2006 and 2005 tax rates were higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 200 4 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 are set forth below 

 

  

net sales 

net sales increased by 1036 million or 55 for the year ended december 31 2005 from the year ended december 31 2004 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes of corrugated products compared to 2004 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 42 to 312 billion square feet in 2005 compared to 299 billion square feet in 2004 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 46 in 2005 from 2004 excluding pca’s acquisition of midland container in april 2005 corrugated products volume was 30 higher in 2005 than 2004 and up 34 compared to 2004 on a shipmentperworkday basis shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2005 had one less workday 250 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2004 251 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 122 to 417000 tons for the year ended december 31 2005 from 475000 tons in 2004 

income from operations 

income from operations decreased by 244 million or 173 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 2004 included in income from operations for the year ended december 31 2004 is income of 278 million net of expenses attributable to a dividend paid to pca by stv the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a 31 1 ¤ 3  ownership interest additionally in 2004 stv purchased a portion of pca’s interest in stv which resulted in a pretax gain of 20 million included in income from operations for the year ended december 31 2005 is income of 140 million net of expenses due to two additional dividends paid to pca by stv

excluding the dividends from stv and the equity sale described above income from operations decreased 86 million in 2005 compared to 2004 the 86 million decrease in income from operations was primarily attributable to increased costs related to transportation 211 million energy primarily purchased fuels and electricity 205 million wood fiber 104 million annual wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel 138 million medical pension and other benefit costs 75 million other corrugated converting costs primarily materials and supplies 49 million and mill chemicals 39 million those cost items were largely offset by increased sales prices and volume 746 million 

gross profit increased 91 million or 31 for the year ended december 31 2005 from the year ended december 31 2004 gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined from 158 of net sales in 2004 to 154 of net sales in the current year primarily due to the cost increases described above which was almost entirely offset by improved sales pricing and volume 

selling and administrative expenses increased 103 million or 76 for the year ended december 31 2005 from the comparable period in 2004 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense 71 million and related fringe benefits 17 million and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements 17 million 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 29 million or 64 from the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to higher professional fees primarily related to investor relations legal and human resource matters 14 million and increased salaries 11 million 

other expense net increased 45 million or 735 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to a 33 million increase in expenses related to the disposals of property plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in connection with capital projects and a portion of a corrugated products manufacturing plant’s closure costs 14 million which were recorded in other expense net in 2005 

interest expense net and income taxes 

interest expense net of interest income decreased by 15 million or 50 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in interest income earned on our cash equivalents partially offset by higher interest expense on our variable rate debt due to higher interest rates 

pca’s effective tax rate was 402 for the year ended december 31 2005 and 380 for the year ended december 31 2004 the higher tax rate in 2005 is due to an increase in tax accruals recorded for prior years for both years 2005 and 2004 tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 39 million or 16 to 2466 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net income in 2006 as previously described primarily offset by higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 395 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 a lower deferred tax provision of 359 million due to the utilization of a federal net operating loss carry forward in 2005 and the required reclassification of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation expense from operating activities to financing activities in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 the excess tax benefits increased cash provided by operating activities by 54 million for the year ended december 31 2005 during 2006 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 651 million or 334 of book income before taxes of 1947 million compared to pca’s effective tax rate of 358 in 2006 the company expects the 2007 cash tax rate for both federal and state income tax payments to be in line with the effective tax rate of about 37 

the higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities were driven by unfavorable year over year changes in accounts receivable 555 million primarily due to increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard in the year ended 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 and accounts payable 184 million partially offset by favorable year over year changes in inventories 66 million and accrued liabilities 266 million 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 274 million or 127 to 2427 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 505 million partially offset by lower deferred taxes of 255 million the decrease in deferred taxes was due primarily to the elimination of bonus depreciation which resulted in substantially lower tax depreciation in 2005 than in 2004 partially offset by the use of a federal net operating loss carry forward during 2005 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 101 million or 115 of book income before income taxes of 880 million compared to pca’s effective tax rate of 402 in 2005 the lower cash tax rate compared to the effective tax rate was primarily the result of reducing current year taxable income by 686 million through available federal net operating loss carry forwards as of december 31 2005 all federal net operating loss carry forwards have been used without the federal net operating loss carry forwards pca would have owed an additional 240 million in federal tax cash payments in 2005 

the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities in 2005 were driven by a 130 million payment to pactiv in january 2004 for a fourth quarter 2003 negotiated settlement of pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating back to april 12 1999 the date tenneco packaging now pactiv sold us to pca holdings llc additionally pca paid pactiv 100 million in april 2004 as final payment for pca’s participation in pactiv’s salaried pension plan the lower requirements in 2005 were also driven 

by favorable changes in accounts receivable 337 million in 2005 primarily due to lower selling prices in both corrugated products and containerboard at the end of 2005 compared to the end of 2004 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities decreased by 676 million or 419 to 939 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was primarily related to lower cost of acquisitions of businesses of 444 million in 2006 a decrease in additions to property plant and equipment of 371 million in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 partially offset by the 150 million in stv dividends received in 2005 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 447 million or 382 to 1615 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily related to an increase in additions to property plant and equipment of 167 million in 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 lower joint venture dividends received from stv of 143 million in 2005 compared to 2004 higher cost of acquisitions of businesses of 103 million in 2005 and lower proceeds from disposals of property plant and equipment and investments of 31 million received in 2005 

as of december 31 2006 pca had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of 485 million pca believes cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 1035 million for the year ended december 31 2006 a decrease of 784 million or 431 from the comparable period in 2005 the decrease was primarily attributable to the repurchase of 4500000 shares of pca common stock from pca holdings llc for 931 million in december of 2005 partially offset by 89 million in additional longterm debt payments during 2006 compared to 2005 and 82 million in additional dividends paid on pca’s common stock during 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 1819 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 1247 million or 2179 from the comparable period in 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of 4500000 shares of pca common stock from pca holdings llc for a total of 931 million in december 2005 and 331 million in additional dividends paid on pca’s common stock during 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 

pca holds a 31 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in stv in 2005 and 2004 pca received dividends from stv of 150 million and 293 million respectively pca did not receive any dividends in 2006

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on october 6 2006 pca renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional oneyear term expiring on october 5 2007 as of december 31 2006 1090 million was outstanding and 410 million was available for additional 

borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2006 was 1090 million 

on july 7 2003 pca entered into a senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a 1000 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit and a 500 million term loan the senior credit facility expires in 2008 pca’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2006 consisted of 300 million of term loans 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes on july 22 2003 pca used the net proceeds from the offering together with the borrowings under the senior credit facility and cash on hand to purchase 5464 million or 993 of its then outstanding 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes the remaining senior subordinated notes were repurchased on april 1 2004

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2006 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2006 

 

  

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 24 million at december 31 2006 and interest payments on debt outstanding pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2007 due to the recent changes in erisa 

the operating lease commitments capital commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 see notes 8 and 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2006 pca had 1216 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements due to the impact on this borrowing capacity of 194 million of outstanding letters of credit 

currently pca’s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2006 for pca’s outstanding term loan the revolving credit facility the receivables credit facility and the five and tenyear senior notes 

 

  

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 24 million at december 31 2006 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 270 million received in july 2003 from the settlement of the treasury locks related to the five and ten year notes the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the five and tenyear notes and is included in interest expense net 

the revolving credit facility is available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the term loan must be repaid in annual installments in july 2007 through 2008 the revolving credit facility will terminate in july 2008 the receivables credit facility will terminate in october 2007 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates or

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition we must maintain minimum net worth maximum leverage and minimum ebitda to interest ratios under the senior credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indentures and the receivables credit facility 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 1100 million to 1200 million in 2007 these capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

pca believes that its net cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves and as required borrowings under its committed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and future liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

·   resource conservation and recovery act rcra

·   clean water act cwa

·   clean air act caa

·   the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra

·   toxic substance control act tsca

·   safe drinking water act sdwa

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2006 we spent approximately 175 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 158 million and 151 million respectively 

in addition the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk mills the cluster rules affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with these new rules 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances under the terms of the contribution agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2006 remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2006 we maintained an environmental reserve of 61 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 48 million for 2006 and we currently estimate 2007 environmental capital expenditures will be 86 million as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental 

expenditures above the 61 million accrued as of december 31 2006 will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact of inflation 

pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

accounts receivable—allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 03 for amounts less than 90 days past due their contractual terms and 30 for amounts more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based on our historical collection experience if our collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on our experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of our gross selling price accordingly we reserve 10 of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

as of december 31 2006 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 38 million compared to 33 million at december 31 2005 bad debt expense in 2006 was 32 million compared to 27 million in 2005 the 05 million increased expense was primarily attributable to an increase of 04 million recorded in connection with specific customers that were reserved for at the 90 level of their accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2006 for the year ended december 31 2005 bad debt expense was 27 million compared to 01 million in 2004 the increase of 26 million was primarily attributable to increased expense of 12 million related to accounts receivable amounts that were deemed uncollectable an increase of 07 million recorded in connection with specific customers that were 

reserved for at the 90 level of their accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2005 and an increase of 04 million related to accounts receivable amounts that were reserved for at the 30 level because they were over 90 days past due as of december 31 2005 

inventories 

we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 63 and 66 of inventories at current cost at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

pension and postretirement benefits 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on september 30 of each year the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by us based upon annual reviews 

for postretirement health care plan accounting we review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

environmental liabilities 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however our estimates may change we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites 

associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

stockbased compensation 

pca has one stockbased employee compensation plan prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for our stock option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as permitted by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” no stock optionbased employee compensation cost was recognized in the statements of income prior to january 1 2006 as all stock options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant however prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to january 1 2006 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” using the modifiedprospectivetransition method under that transition method stock compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r 

pca uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock the expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 

income taxes 

pca’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on our tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

·   management reviews our deferred tax assets for realizability valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision

·   pca establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported we believe that certain positions may be challenged the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return case law and emerging legislation while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter we believe that the accruals reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies

item 7a   quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes as of december 31 2006 pca was not a party to any derivative instruments 

as the interest rates on approximately 80 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 14 million annually in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure 







 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures 

there were no changes in or disagreements with pca’s accountants during 2006 or 2005 




 item 9a   controls and procedures

during the quarter ended december 31 2006 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 based on the specified criteria

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

 

  

the 23 million tons of containerboard that we produced in 2005 included 14 million tons of kraft linerboard produced at our mills located in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 09 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium produced at our mills located in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 108000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements on about 390000 of the 800000 acres of timberland we sold during 1999 and 2000 

our converting operations produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

corporate developments 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm in january 1999 the business was sold for 22 billion consisting of 2465 million in cash and the assumption of 17600 million of debt incurred by pactiv immediately prior to the contribution pactiv retained a 45 common equity interest or 193500 shares in pca valued at 1935 million pca holdings llc an entity organized and controlled by madison dearborn acquired the remaining 55 common equity interest or 236500 shares in pca for 2365 million in cash which was used to finance in part the transactions 

the share amounts discussed above are prior to a 220for1 stock split which occurred in october 1999 including the effect of the 220for1 split pactiv received 42570000 shares and pca holdings llc received 52030000 shares 

the financing of the transactions consisted of 1 borrowings under a new 14690 million senior credit facility for which jp morgan securities inc and bt alex brown incorporated the predecessor to deutsche banc alex brown were colead arrangers 2 the offering of 5500 million of 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes due 2009 and 1000 million of 12 3 ¤ 8  senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010 3 a cash equity investment of 2365 million by pca holdings llc and 4 an equity investment by pactiv valued at 1935 million as required by their terms the 5500 million of senior subordinated notes and 1000 million of senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the april 12 1999 transactions were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in october 1999

industry overview 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was 237 billion in 2005 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the most recent 2004 fibre box association annual report 

 

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 650 companies and 1400 plants 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required by converters and shipped to them 

linerboard is made in a range of grades or basis weights the most commonly used basis weight of linerboard is 35 lb although linerboard is produced in weights that vary from under 26 lb to over 90 lb basis weight represents the weight in pounds per thousand square feet of linerboard producers also market linerboard by performance characteristics appearance and color 

pca operations and products 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb to 47 lb all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

counce   our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the united states its production capacity is approximately 979000 tons per year in 2005 we produced 966000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce we produced a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard

valdosta   our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 487000 tons per year in 2005 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 475000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb to 90 lb

tomahawk   our tomahawk wisconsin mill is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the united states with production capacity of 575000 tons per year on three paper machines in 2005 we produced 532000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium at tomahawk our number four paper machine at tomahawk is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world in april 2005 we completed an indefinite closure of our number three paper machine at tomahawk this was done after resuming production on our number one paper machine at filer city which had been down since july 1998 the machine shutdown at tomahawk was the result of higher incremental fiber and transportation costs at tomahawk compared to the same incremental costs to operate the number one machine at filer city tomahawk’s production capacity on the two paper machines remaining in operation is 510000 tons our tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 40 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium

filer city   our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill with a production capacity of 385000 tons in 2005 we produced 375000 tons of corrugating medium on january 25 2005 we resumed operation of our number one paper machine at filer city and now operate all three paper machines at the mill filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb to 40 lb

we operate 68 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center five regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies 

and distribution centers of the 68 manufacturing facilities 40 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 28 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers the five graphic design centers are located in fairfield ohio dallas texas cranbury new jersey salisbury north carolina and south gate california 

we have corrugated manufacturing operations in 27 states in the us with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental us each corrugator plant serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugator plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 108000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining on average 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold about 800000 acres of timberland as part of the timberland sale agreements we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600000 acres of the total acres sold in 2005 the supply agreement related to our valdosta mill on approximately 200000 acres was terminated through a mutual agreement because lower cost pulpwood was available in closer proximity to the mill we hold a 31 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in approximately 53000 acres owned by southern timber venture llc stv this acreage is located primarily in southern georgia and northern florida and includes both timberlands and higher beneficial use hbu properties we currently have in place supply agreements covering about 390000 of the 800000 acres sold the majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close proximity to our counce mill

in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 125000 acres by supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include over 210000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest approximately 75000 cords of wood from these forests annually 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative which is organized by the american forest and paper association this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

solid wood facilities 

during 2005 we owned and operated two sawmills located in ackerman and fulton mississippi which sold 131 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and building products we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization we have sales representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who serve local and regional accounts we also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize support personnel that are new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugator plants as well as the graphic design centers 

distribution 

our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck rail shipments represent about 65 of the tons shipped and the remaining 35 is comprised of truck shipments our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we do use some thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage 

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 8300 customers in over 15000 locations about 65 to 70 of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 to 35 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply   fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources with the exception of our valdosta mill our other mills can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2005 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 592000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 211000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 381000 tons or 16 of our total fiber requirements

energy supply   energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally 

produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility in recent history natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark during 2005 124 million mmbtu’s million btu’s or approximately 75 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 11 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 7 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 28 million mmbtu’s of oil 17 of the mills’ total purchased fuels our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately twothirds of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts 

pca’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2005 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 21 million mmbtu’s of natural gas 

the following table shows pca’s purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2005 

 

  

in the second half of 2005 a concentrated effort was undertaken to minimize the use of natural gas the highest cost per mmbtu fuel consumed in our mills as a result of this effort we were able to operate our mills with only 49 natural gas use during the third quarter and only 33 natural gas use during the fourth quarter 

approximately 45 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite our mills purchase approximately 8965000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 31 million mmbtu’s pca’s corrugated products plants purchase about 2420000 ckwh annually or the equivalent of 08 million mmbtu’s 

competition 

corrugated products are produced by about 650 us companies operating approximately 1400 plants most corrugated products are custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include international paper company koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we believe we compete as much with the smaller independent converters as with the larger integrated producers 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including international paper company koch industries inc smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 8300 employees approximately 2300 of these employees were salaried and approximately 6000 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions the majority of our unionized employees are represented primarily by the united steel workers usw the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and the international association of machinists iam 

contracts for unionized employees at our containerboard mills expire between may 2006 and october 2009 contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between february 2006 and december 2011 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that are expiring in the near future 

during 2005 we experienced no work stoppages in 2001 we experienced a onemonth strike at our filer city mill with the usw the strike was settled and the mill’s current agreement expires in may 2006 prior to this incident we had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years we believe we have satisfactory employment relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

1   resource conservation and recovery act rcra

2   clean water act cwa

3   clean air act caa

4   the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra

5   toxic substance control act tsca

6   safe drinking water act sdwa

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2005 we spent approximately 158 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 151 million and 124 million respectively we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

in april 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized a new clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster rules which govern all pulp and paper mill operations including those at our mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants as a result pca and its competitors are required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules from 1997 through 2005 we spent approximately 375 million on cluster rule compliance to meet clean air act requirements total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 129 million for 2005 we currently estimate 2006 environmental capital expenditures will be 55 million  of which 19 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements we currently expect to complete all projects related to cluster rule compliance requirements at our four mills during 2006 and estimate the cost to do so to be about 19 million 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2005 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 32 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2005 we maintained an environmental reserve of 55 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 55 million reserve 33 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

as a part of the april 12 1999 transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 55 million accrued as of december 31 2005 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors

some of the statements in this report and in our 2005 annual report to shareholders and in particular statements found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are often identified by the words “will” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “hope” or similar expressions these statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forwardlooking statements many of which are beyond our control these factors risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors described below 

our actual results performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements and accordingly we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will transpire or occur or if any of them do so what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition in view of these uncertainties investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof 

industry risks 

industry earnings cyclicality —imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and as a result could result in lower selling prices and earnings 

the price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand the demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the united states and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers market needs or demand are driven by both global and us business conditions if supply exceeds demand prices for containerboard could decline resulting in decreased earnings and cash flow 

from time to time we have taken downtime or slowbacks at some of our mills to balance our production of containerboard with the market demand for our containerboard and we may continue to do so in the future some of our competitors have also temporarily closed or reduced production at their containerboard mills some of which could reopen and increase production capacity this could result in a supply and demand imbalance and cause prices to fall 

competition —the intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry combined with the commodity nature of containerboard could result in downward pressure on pricing which could lower earnings 

pca operates in an industry that is highly competitive with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer which tends to intensify price competition the corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to price fluctuations as well as other factors including innovation design quality and service to the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our business could be adversely affected our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal the intensity of containerboard competition and the commodity nature of containerboard plus the intensity of corrugated packaging competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower prices for our products both of which could reduce our earnings 

company risks 

cost of wood fiber— dependence on external wood fiber sources could lead to higher costs and lower earnings for pca 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold 800000 acres of owned timberlands in connection with these sales we entered into supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at three of our four mills currently we have supply agreements on about 390000 of the 800000 acres of timberlands sold in addition to these supply agreements pca also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices 

because we do not own any timberlands we are more vulnerable to changes in availability of wood fiber in areas adjacent to our mills than those of our competitors who do own timberlands in areas adjacent to their mills and therefore could face higher wood fiber costs than those competitors both in terms of the cost of the wood fiber itself as well as the transportation costs to get the wood fiber to our mills the price for wood fiber has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control including environmental and conservation regulations natural disasters and the weather 

any increase in wood fiber costs could cause our manufacturing costs to increase and our earnings to decrease to a greater extent than those of our competitors who own their own timberlands 

cost of recycled fiber— an increase in the cost of recycled fiber could increase our containerboard manufacturing costs and lower our earnings  

pca purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills pca currently purchases net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants approximately 400000 tons of recycled fiber per year 

the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber these periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility we expect that periods of above average recycled fiber costs and overall price volatility will continue which could result in earnings volatility 

cost of purchased energy —an increase in the cost of purchased energy particularly natural gas and oil could lead to higher manufacturing costs resulting in reduced earnings 

pca has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations including coal bark natural gas and oil energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have 

fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in recent years these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility if energy prices rise our production costs will increase which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings 

environmental matters —pca may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws in our 2005 annual report on form 10k under the caption “environmental matters” we provide certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years although we have established reserves to provide for future environmental liability these reserves may not be adequate 

restrictions imposed by the senior credit facility the receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes — our operating flexibility is limited in certain respects by the covenants in our senior credit facility the receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes

our senior credit facility receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes impose restrictions on us that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and industry specifically these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions and

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

major stockholder potential conflicts— the interests of our major stockholder could conflict with those of the other holders of our common stock  

our largest stockholder pca holdings llc an entity controlled by madison dearborn partners holds 21773010 or 210 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of february 17 2006 two representatives of madison dearborn partners are members of pca’s seven member board of directors and will continue to play a major role in determining the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders including the election of directors the interests of madison dearborn partners could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 

investment risks 

availability of significant amounts of common stock for sale— the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected as a result of the availability of a significant amount of our common stock for sale 

pca holdings llc currently has registration rights that require us to register its shares of common stock under the securities act at our expense the future sale of a significant number of shares of pca’s common stock held by pca holdings in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 

potential impediments to a change of control— some of the provisions of our charter documents and the presence of a large stockholder could discourage acquisition proposals by third parties and could delay deter or prevent a change in control 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors subject to any limitations prescribed by law to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval the issuance of preferred stock while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock the presence of a significant stockholder may also deter a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of pca even if that might be favorable to pca or pca’s other stockholders 

market price of our common stock— the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly

 item 2 properties 

the table below provides a summary of our containerboard mills the principal products produced and each mill’s annual capacity based upon current operations 

 

   in january 2005 we resumed operations on our number one paper machine at our filer city mill and shut down our number three paper machine at our tomahawk mill in april 2005 shutting down the number three machine at tomahawk reduces our total productive capacity by 65000 tons at tomahawk to 510000 tons and to 2361000 tons for our total containerboard mill system this action was based on market conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or productivity levels change going forward

we currently own our four containerboard mills and 46 of our corrugated manufacturing operations 37 corrugated plants and nine sheet plants we also own two sawmills an airdrying yard one warehouse and miscellaneous other property which includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices these sales offices and woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative offices pca leases the space for three corrugated plants 19 sheet plants five regional design centers and numerous other distribution centers warehouses and facilities the equipment in these leased facilities is in virtually all cases owned by pca except for forklifts and other rolling stock which are generally leased 

we lease the cutting rights to approximately 108000 acres of timberland located near our valdosta 89000 acres and counce 19000 acres mills most of these cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining on average 

we currently lease space for our corporate headquarters in lake forest illinois the lease for the lake forest illinois facility is a short term facility use agreement lease with automatic renewal rights specifically this lease is a continuous monthtomonth lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling either party the right to terminate the lease with at least 8 months notice we currently believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 




 item 3   legal proceedings

on may 14 1999 pca was named as a defendant in two consolidated class action complaints which alleged a civil violation of section 1 of the sherman act the suits then captioned winoff industries inc v stone container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa and general refractories co v gaylord container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa name pca as a defendant based solely on the allegation that pca is successor to the interests of tenneco packaging inc and tenneco inc both of which were also named as defendants in the suits along with nine other linerboard and corrugated sheet manufacturers the complaints allege that the defendants during the period october 1 1993 through november 30 1995 conspired to limit the supply of linerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of corrugated containers and corrugated sheets respectively on november 3 2003 pactiv formerly known as tenneco packaging tenneco and pca entered into an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits the settlement agreement provides for a full release of all claims against pca as a result of the class action lawsuits and was approved by the court in an opinion issued on april 21 2004 approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class and together filed about ten direct action complaints in various federal courts across the country all of the optout complaints make allegations against the defendants including pca substantially similar to those made in the class actions the settlement agreement does not cover these direct action cases these actions have all been consolidated as in re linerboard  mdl 1261 ed pa for pretrial purposes pactiv tenneco and pca have reached an agreement to settle all of the optout cases these agreements provide for a full release of all claims against pca as a result of litigation pca has made no payments to the plaintiffs as a result of the settlement of any of the optout suits as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the outcome of any pending litigation related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

pca is also party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

on april 12 1999 pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the “group” formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc the group operated prior to april 12 1999 as a division of pactiv and not as a separate standalone entity from its formation in january 1999 and through the closing of the acquisition on april 12 1999 pca did not have any significant operations 

the april 12 1999 acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets purchase accounting was not applied because under the applicable accounting guidance a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 are set forth the below 

 

  

net sales 

net sales increased by 1036 million or 55 for the year ended december 31 2005 from the year ended december 31 2004 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes of corrugated products compared to 2004 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 42 to 312 billion square feet in 2005 compared to 299 billion square feet in 2004 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 46 in 2005 from 2004 excluding pca’s acquisition of midland container in april 2005 corrugated products volume was 30 higher in 2005 than 2004 and up 34 compared to 2004 on a shipmentperworkday basis shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2005 had one less workday 250 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2004 251 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 122 to 417000 tons for the year ended december 31 2005 from 475000 tons in 2004 

income before interest and taxes 

income before interest and taxes decreased by 244 million or 173 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 2004 included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december 31 2004 is income of 278 million net of expenses attributable to a dividend paid to pca by southern timber venture llc stv the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a 31 1 ¤ 3  ownership interest additionally in 2004 stv purchased a portion of the company’s interest in stv which resulted in a pretax gain of 20 million included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december 31 2005 is income of 140 million net of expenses due to two additional dividends paid to pca by stv

excluding the dividends from stv and the equity sale described previously operating income decreased 86 million in 2005 compared to 2004 the 86 million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to increased costs related to transportation 211 million energy primarily purchased fuels and electricity 205 million wood fiber 104 million annual wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel 138 million medical pension and other benefit costs 75 million other corrugated converting costs primarily materials and supplies 49 million and mill chemicals 39 million those cost items were largely offset by increased sales prices and volume 746 million 

gross profit increased 91 million or 31 for the year ended december 31 2005 from the year ended december 31 2004 gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined from 158 of net sales in 2004 to 154 of net sales in the current year primarily due to the cost increases described above which was almost entirely offset by improved sales pricing and volume 

selling and administrative expenses increased 103 million or 76 for the year ended december 31 2005 from the comparable period in 2004 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense 71 million and related fringe benefits 17 million and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements 17 million 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 29 million or 64 from the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to higher professional fees primarily related to investor relations legal and human resource matters 14 million and increased salaries 11 million  

other expense net increased 45 million or 735 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to a 33 million increase in expenses related to the disposals of property plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in connection with capital projects and a portion of a corrugated products manufacturing plant’s closure costs 14 million which were recorded in other expense net 

interest expense net and income taxes 

interest expense net of interest income decreased by 15 million or 50 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in interest income earned on the company’s cash equivalents partially offset by higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate debt due to higher interest rates 

pca’s effective tax rate was 402 for the year ended december 31 2005 and 380 for the year ended december 31 2004 the higher tax rate in 2005 is due to an increase in tax accruals recorded for prior years for both years 2005 and 2004 tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 are set forth below 

 

  

net sales 

net sales increased by 1546 million or 89 for the year ended december 31 2004 from the year ended december 31 2003 net sales increased due to improved sales volumes and prices of corrugated products and containerboard compared to 2003 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 66 to 299 billion square feet in 2004 compared to 281 billion square feet in 2003 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 70 in 2004 from 2003 excluding pca’s acquisition of acorn in february 2004 corrugated products volume was 53 higher in 2004 than 2003 and up 58 compared to 2003 on a shipmentperworkday basis shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2004 had one less workday 251 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2003 252 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 68 to 475000 tons for the year ended december 31 2004 from 445000 tons in 2003 

income before interest and taxes 

income before interest and taxes increased by 436 million or 451 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 2003 included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december 31 2004 is income of 278 million net of expenses attributable to a dividend paid to pca by stv the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a 31 1 ¤ 3  ownership interest included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december 31 2003 is a 33 million charge for fees and expenses related to the company’s debt refinancing which was completed in july 2003 and a fourth quarter charge of 160 million to settle certain benefits related matters with pactiv corporation dating back to april 12 1999 when pca became a standalone company as described below

during the fourth quarter of 2003 pactiv notified pca that we owed pactiv additional amounts for hourly pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating back to april 12 1999 a settlement of 160 million was negotiated between pactiv and pca in december 2003 the full amount of the settlement was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003 

excluding these special items operating income decreased 34 million in 2004 compared to 2003 the 34 million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to increased energy and transportation costs 192 million higher recycled and wood fiber costs 167 million increased salary expenses related to annual increases and new hires 57 million and increased contractual hourly labor costs 56 million which was partially offset by increased sales volume and sales prices 443 million 

gross profit decreased 02 million or 01 for the year ended december 31 2004 from the year ended december 31 2003 gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined from 172 of net sales in 2003 to 158 of net sales in the current year primarily due to the cost increases described above 

selling and administrative expenses increased 86 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2004 from the comparable period in 2003 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense 42 million and related fringe benefits 10 million higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements 11 million increased travel entertainment and promotional expenses 09 million increased broker commissions 06 million and higher recruiting relocation and training costs 06 million 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2004 decreased by 16 million or 35 from the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing 33 million incurred in 2003 partially offset by increased salaries 08 million and higher professional fees primarily related to audits of internal controls 07 million 

other expense net decreased 62 million or 500 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in charges on disposal and transfer costs of fixed assets and facility closure costs of 33 million reduced legal charges of 15 million and a reduction in expenses of 14 million consisting of individually insignificant items 

interest expense net and income taxes 

interest expense net of interest income decreased in 2004 by 922 million or 757 from 2003 this decrease included 733 million of expenses related to the company’s debt refinancing in july 2003 the 733 million of expenses consisted of 559 million paid in premiums for the tender of the 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes and a 174 million noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the 9 5 ¤ 8  notes and pca’s original revolving credit facility excluding the 733 million charge interest expense in 2004 was 189 million lower than in 2003 as a result of lower interest rates attributable to the company’s july 2003 refinancing and lower debt levels

pca’s effective tax rate was 380 for the year ended december 31 2004 and 423 for the year ended december 31 2003 the higher tax rate in 2003 is due to stable permanent items over a lower level of book income loss for both years 2004 and 2003 tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 274 million or 127 to 2427 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 505 million partially offset by lower deferred taxes of 255 million the decrease in deferred taxes was due primarily to the elimination of bonus depreciation which resulted in substantially lower tax depreciation in 2005 than in 2004 partially offset by the use of a federal net operating loss carry forward during 2005 pca’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were 101 million or 115 of book income before income taxes of 880 million compared to pca’s effective tax rate of 402 in 2005 the lower cash tax rate compared to the effective tax rate was primarily the result of reducing current year taxable income by 686 million through available federal net operating loss carry forwards as of december 31 2005 all federal net operating loss carry forwards have been used without the federal net operating loss carry forwards pca would have owed an additional 240 million in federal tax cash payments in 2005 the company expects the 2006 cash tax rate for both federal and state income tax payments to be between 320 and 350 

the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities in 2005 were driven by a 130 million payment to pactiv in january 2004 for a fourth quarter 2003 negotiated settlement of pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating back to april 12 1999 the date tenneco packaging now pactiv sold us to pca holdings llc additionally pca paid pactiv 100 million in april 2004 as final payment for pca’s participation in pactiv’s salaried pension plan the lower requirements in 2005 were also driven by favorable changes in accounts receivable 337 million in 2005 primarily due to lower selling prices in both corrugated products and containerboard at the end of 2005 compared to the end of 2004 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 284 million or 116 to 2153 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the comparable period in 2003 the decrease was the result of higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities of 514 million partially offset by higher net income and increased deferred taxes as a result of the higher income levels in 2004 the higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities were driven by the 130 million payment to pactiv in january 2004 as previously described that was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the 100 million payment to pactiv for participation in their salaried pension plan in april 2004 as previously described of which 75 million was accrued at december 31 2003 the higher requirements in 2004 were also driven by unfavorable changes in accounts payable 131 million prepaid expenses and other current assets 121 million primarily due to a federal income tax refund received in 2003 as well as higher levels of accounts receivable 111 million in 2004 primarily due to improved sales volumes and pricing previously described 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 447 million or 382 to 1615 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily related to an increase in additions to property plant and equipment of 167 million in 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 lower joint venture dividends received from stv of 143 million in 2005 compared to 2004 higher cost of acquisitions of 103 million in 2005 and lower proceeds from disposals of property plant and equipment and investments of 31 million received in 2005 see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding acquisitions 

net cash used for investing activities was unchanged for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 expenditures for property plant and equipment were lower by 46 million in 2004 compared to 2003 joint venture dividends received from stv were higher by 281 million 

in 2004 compared to 2003 and proceeds received from the 2004 sale of a small portion of pca’s investment in stv were offset by higher acquisitions in 2004 of 346 million 

as of december 31 2005 pca had commitments for capital expenditures of 331 million pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 1819 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 1247 million or 2179 from the comparable period in 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of 4500000 shares of pca common stock from pca holdings llc for a total of 931 million in december 2005 and 331 million in additional dividends paid on pca’s common stock during 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 

net cash used for financing activities decreased 290 million or 336 to 572 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to 40 million in debt prepayments in 2004 compared to 941 million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in 2003 and stock repurchases of 175 million made in 2003 this was partially offset by dividend payments on pca’s common stock of 637 million in 2004 and the 138 million in proceeds that pca netted from the debt refinancing in 2003 described below 

in connection with the debt refinancing in july 2003 pca received proceeds net of discount of 5960 million from its notes offering and new senior credit facility and 270 million from settlement of the treasury lock which it used to complete the tender offer of its 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes in the amount of 6023 million including the premium pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of 69 million in connection with the debt refinancing

pca holds a 31 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in stv in 2005 2004 and 2003 pca received dividends from stv of 150 million 85 million net of taxes and expenses 293 million 169 million net of taxes and expenses and 12 million 07 million aftertax respectively

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on october 31 2003 pca renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional threeyear term expiring on october 10 2006 as of december 31 2005 1090 million was outstanding and 410 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2005 was 1090 million 

on july 7 2003 pca repaid all borrowings under its thenexisting senior credit facility this facility was replaced with a senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a 1000 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit and a 500 million term loan the senior credit facility closed on july 21 2003 and it expires in 2008 pca’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2005 consisted of 390 million of term loans 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes on july 22 2003 pca used the net proceeds from the offering together with the borrowings under the senior credit facility and cash on hand to purchase 5464 million or 993 of its then outstanding 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes as a result of these transactions pca recorded a onetime charge of approximately 766 million 467 million aftertax in the third quarter of 2003 the 766 million charge includes the tender offer premium of 559 million and a 174 million noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees due to the early extinguishment of debt which are included in interest expense and fees and expenses of 33 million which are included in corporate overhead as required by their terms the 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in december 2003 the remaining senior subordinated notes were repurchased on april 1 2004

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2005 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2005 

 

  

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 29 million at december 31 2005 and interest payments on debt outstanding pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2010 

the lease commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 see notes 7 and 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2005 pca had 1216 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements due to the impact on this borrowing capacity of 194 million of outstanding letters of credit 

pca’s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures debt service and declared common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2005 for pca’s outstanding term loan the revolving credit facility the receivables credit facility and the five and tenyear senior notes 

 

  

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 29 million at december 31 2005 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 270 million received in july 2003 from the settlement of the treasury locks related to the five and ten year notes the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the five and tenyear notes and is included in interest expense net 

the revolving credit facility is available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the term loan must be repaid in annual installments from july 2006 through 2008 the revolving credit facility will terminate in july 2008 the receivables credit facility will terminate in october 2006 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates or

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition we must maintain minimum net worth maximum leverage and minimum ebitda to interest ratios under the senior credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indentures and the receivables credit facility 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 950 million to 1050 million in 2006 these capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

pca believes that its net cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves and as required borrowings under its committed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and future liquidity and capital requirements including payments of any declared common stock dividends as its debt or credit facilities become due pca will need to repay extend or replace such facilities which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

·   resource conservation and recovery act rcra

·   clean water act cwa

·   clean air act caa

·   the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra

·   toxic substance control act tsca

·   safe drinking water act sdwa

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2005 we spent approximately 158 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 151 million and 124 million respectively 

in addition the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk mills the cluster rules affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances under the terms of the contribution agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from 1994 through 2005 remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately 32 million as of december 31 2005 we maintained an environmental reserve of 55 million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 129 million for 2005 and we currently estimate 2006 environmental capital expenditures will be 55 million of which 19 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements as of this 

filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 55 million accrued as of december 31 2005 will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact of inflation 

pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

accounts receivable—allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 03 for amounts less than 90 days past due their contractual terms and 30 for amounts more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based on our historical collection experience if our collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on our experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of our gross selling price accordingly we reserve 10 of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 

as of december 31 2005 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions reserve was 54 million compared to 46 million at december 31 2004 bad debt expense in 2005 was 26 million compared to 04 million in 2004 the 22 million increase was primarily attributable to increased expense of 12 million related to accounts receivable amounts that were deemed uncollectable and an increase of 07 million recorded in connection with specific customers that were reserved for at the 90 level of their accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2005 for the year ended december 31 

2004 bad debt expense was 04 million compared to 18 million in 2003 the decrease of 14 million was primarily attributable to a reduction of 08 million related to specific customers that were reserved for at 90 of their outstanding accounts receivable balances and a reduction of 03 million in expense due to accounts receivable that were deemed uncollectable in 2004 compared to 2003 

inventories 

we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the carrying value of inventory may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” cost method comprised 66 of inventories at current cost at both december 31 2005 and 2004 supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

pension and postretirement benefits 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 of each year the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used for pension accounting and is determined by the company based upon annual reviews 

for postretirement health care plan accounting our company reviews external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 

environmental liabilities 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however our estimates may change we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales in addition pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a writedown to fair value is necessary 

longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

stockbased compensation 

the company has one stockbased employee compensation plan the company’s stockbased employee compensation plan is accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees’’ and related interpretations because the number of shares is fixed and the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant no cost is reflected in net income for stock options granted under the plan the company amortizes restricted stock awards to net earnings over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock at the date of grant note 2 to the consolidated financial statements provide supplemental information including pro forma income and earnings per share as if the company had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation’’ the estimate of fair value requires a number of assumptions including estimated option life and future volatility of the underlying stock price changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the stock options 

income taxes 

the company’s annual tax rate is determined based on income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on the company’s tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes significant management judgments are required for the following items 

·   management reviews the company’s deferred tax assets for realizability valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of 

the deferred tax assets will not be realized changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision 

·   the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that the company’s tax return positions are fully supported the company believes that certain positions may be challenged the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return case law and emerging legislation while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter the company believes that the accruals reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies

item 7a   quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes as of december 31 2005 pca was not party to any derivative instruments 

as the interest rates on approximately 79 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 15 million annually for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the weighted average libor was 453 and 256 respectively and the weighted average commercial paper rate was 432 and 233 respectively in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure 







 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures

there were no changes in or disagreements with pca’s accountants during 2005 or 2004 




 item 9a   controls and procedures

controls and procedures 

pca’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of december 31 2005 the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k 

based upon their evaluation as of december 31 2005 pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to pca is made known to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer particularly during the periods when pca’s periodic reports are being prepared 

during the quarter ended december 31 2005 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

pca’s management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway 

commission based on this assessment pca’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2005 based on the specified criteria 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein at page f3

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

   

the 23 million tons of containerboard that we produced in 2004 included 14 million tons of kraft linerboard produced at our mills located in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia and 09 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium produced at our mills located in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 115000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements on about 600000 of the 800000 acres of timberland we sold during 1999 and 2000 

our converting operations produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations in addition we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

corporate developments 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm in january 1999 the business was sold for 22 billion consisting of 2465 million in cash and the assumption of 17600 million of debt incurred by pactiv immediately prior to the contribution pactiv retained a 45 common equity interest or 193500 shares in pca valued at 1935 million pca holdings llc an entity organized and controlled by madison dearborn acquired the remaining 55 common equity interest or 236500 shares in pca for 2365 million in cash which was used to finance in part the transactions 

the share amounts discussed above are prior to a 220for1 stock split which occurred in october 1999 including the effect of the 220for1 split pactiv received 42570000 shares and pca holdings llc received 52030000 shares 

the financing of the transactions consisted of 1 borrowings under a new 14690 million senior credit facility for which jp morgan securities inc and bt alex brown incorporated the predecessor to deutsche banc alex brown were colead arrangers 2 the offering of 5500 million of 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes due 2009 and 1000 million of 12 3 ¤ 8  senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010 3 a cash equity investment of 2365 million by pca holdings llc and 4 an equity investment by pactiv valued at 1935 million as required by their terms the 5500 million of senior subordinated notes and 1000 million of senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the april 12 1999 transactions were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in october 1999

the senior credit facility was entered into to finance in part the transactions and to pay related fees and expenses and to provide future borrowings to pca for general corporate purposes including working capital the senior credit facility initially consisted of three term loan facilities in an original aggregate principal amount of 12190 million and a revolving credit facility with up to 2500 million in availability effective december 14 1999 pca elected to reduce its availability under the revolving credit facility from 2500 million to 1500 million

industry overview 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was over 23 billion in 2004 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below 

   

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the us corrugated products industry consists of approximately 650 companies and 1400 plants 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods 

such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required by converters and shipped to them 

linerboard is made in a range of grades or basis weights the most commonly used basis weight of linerboard is 35 lb although linerboard is produced in weights that vary from under 26 lb to over 90 lb basis weight represents the weight in pounds per thousand square feet of linerboard producers also market linerboard by performance characteristics appearance and color 

pca operations and products 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb to 47 lb all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

counce   our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the united states its production capacity is approximately 1002000 tons per year in 2004 we produced 999000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce we produced a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard

valdosta   our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 463000 tons per year in 2004 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 457000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb to 90 lb

tomahawk   our tomahawk wisconsin mill is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the united states with production capacity of 573000 tons per year in 2004 we produced 572000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on three paper machines one of which is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world on january 20 2005 we announced that we will shut down our number three paper machine at tomahawk after resuming reliable production on our number one paper machine at filer city due to lower incremental fiber and transportation costs at filer city this plan is based on current market conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or productivity levels change going forward tomahawk’s production capacity on the two paper machines remaining in operation is 507000 tons our tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 40 lb and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium

filer city   our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill with a production capacity of 363000 tons in 2004 we ran two of the three paper machines at filer city and produced 290000 tons of corrugating medium on january 25 2005 we resumed operation of our number one paper machine at filer city and now operate all three paper machines at the mill filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb to 40 lb

we operate 66 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center five regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 66 manufacturing facilities 40 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 26 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers the five graphic design centers are located in cincinnati ohio dallas texas cranbury new jersey salisbury north carolina and south gate california 

our corrugated manufacturing operations are spread throughout the united states each corrugator plant serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in 

close proximity to our larger corrugator plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 115000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of our mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber most of these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold about 800000 acres of timberland as part of the timberland sale agreements we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600000 acres of the total acres sold we also hold a 31 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in approximately 150000 acres owned by southern timber venture llc

in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 125000 acres by supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include over 215000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest approximately 75000 cords of wood from these forests annually 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative which is organized by the american forest and paper association this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

solid wood facilities 

on february 2 2004 we sold our selmer tennessee sawmill this facility produced and sold 10 million board feet of lumber in 2003 with net sales of 45 million 

the two remaining sawmills that we owned and operated in 2004 are located in ackerman and fulton mississippi during 2004 these two sawmills sold 136 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and building products we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization sales representatives and a sales manager at each converting operations facility serve local and regional accounts corporate account managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize support personnel that are new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugator plants as well as the graphic design centers 

distribution 

our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we do use some thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage 

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 8200 customers in over 15000 locations about 65 to 70 of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 to 35 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply   fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources with the exception of our valdosta mill our other mills can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated products plants generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2004 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 602000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 205000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 397000 tons or 17 of our total fiber requirements

energy supply   energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility historically natural gas and fuel oil have shown more price volatility than coal and purchased bark during 2004 117 million m 2 btu’s million btu’s or approximately 70 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 14 million m 2 btu’s of natural gas 9 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 31 million m 2 btu’s of fuel oil 19 of the mills’ total purchased fuels

our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately 70 of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts approximately 45 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite 

pca’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2004 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 18 million m 2 btu’s of natural gas 

competition 

corrugated products are produced by about 650 us companies operating approximately 1400 plants most corrugated products are custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include georgiapacific corporation international paper company smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we believe we compete as much with the smaller independent converters as with the larger integrated producers 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including georgiapacific corporation international paper company smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 8100 employees approximately 2200 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5900 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions our unionized employees are represented primarily by the paper allied industrial chemical energy workers international union pace the international association of machinists iam the graphic communications international union gciu and the united steel workers of america uswa 

contracts for unionized mill employees at our containerboard mills expire between may 2006 and october 2009 contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between october 2004 and january 2011 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

during 2004 we experienced no work stoppages in 2001 we experienced a onemonth strike at our filer city mill with the uswa the strike was settled and the mill’s current agreement expires in may 2006 prior to this incident we had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws 

particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

1 resource conservation and recovery act rcra 

2 clean water act cwa 

3 clean air act caa 

4 the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra 

5 toxic substance control act tsca 

6 safe drinking water act sdwa 

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2004 we spent approximately 151 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 124 million and 115 million respectively we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

in april 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized a new clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster rules which govern all pulp and paper mill operations including those at our mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants as a result pca and its competitors are required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules from 1997 through 2004 we spent approximately 345 million on cluster rule compliance to meet clean air act requirements total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 93 million for 2004 we currently estimate 2005 environmental capital expenditures will be 141 million  of which 30 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements our current spending projections to complete all cluster rule compliance requirements at our four mills is about 48 million which will be spent between 2005 and 2007 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2004 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 31 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2004 we maintained an environmental reserve of 57 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 57 million reserve 38 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

as a part of the april 12 1999 transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 57 million accrued as of december 31 2004 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 item 2  properties

the table below provides a summary of our containerboard mills the principal products produced and each mill’s annual capacity 

   

 on january 20 2005 we announced that we would start up our number one paper machine at our filer city mill and after this machine was performing reliably we would then shut down our number three paper machine at our tomahawk mill shutting down the number three machine at tomahawk will reduce our total productive capacity by 66000 tons to 507000 tons and to 2335000 tons for our total containerboard mill system this plan is based on current market conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or productivity levels change going forward

we currently own all four containerboard mills and 44 of our corrugated manufacturing operations we also own two sawmills an airdrying yard one warehouse and miscellaneous other property which includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices these sales offices and woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative offices pca leases the space for three corrugated plants 19 sheet plants five regional design centers and numerous other distribution centers warehouses and facilities the equipment in these leased facilities is in virtually all cases owned by pca except for forklifts and other rolling stock which is generally leased 

we lease the cutting rights to approximately 115000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills most of these cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining 

we currently lease space for our executive and administrative offices in lake forest illinois the lease for the lake forest illinois facility is a short term facility use agreement lease with automatic renewal rights specifically this lease is a continuous monthtomonth lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling either party the right to terminate the lease with at least 8 months notice we currently believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 




 item 3  legal proceedings

on may 14 1999 pca was named as a defendant in two consolidated class action complaints which alleged a civil violation of section 1 of the sherman act the suits then captioned winoff industries inc v stone container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa and general refractories co v gaylord container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa name pca as a defendant based solely on the allegation that pca is successor to the interests of tenneco packaging inc and tenneco inc both of which were also named as defendants in the suits along with nine other linerboard and corrugated sheet manufacturers the complaints allege that the defendants during the period october 1 1993 through november 30 1995 conspired to limit the supply of linerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of corrugated containers and corrugated sheets respectively on november 3 2003 pactiv formerly known as tenneco packaging tenneco and pca entered into an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits the settlement agreement provides for a full release of all claims against pca as a result of the class action lawsuits and was approved by the court in an opinion issued on april 21 2004 approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class and together filed about ten direct 

action complaints in various federal courts across the country all of the optout complaints make allegations against the defendants including pca substantially similar to those made in the class actions the settlement agreement does not cover these direct action cases these actions have all been consolidated as in re linerboard  mdl 1261 ed pa for pretrial purposes fact discovery is proceeding and is currently set to close june 30 2005 as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

pca is also party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

on april 12 1999 pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the “group” formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc the group operated prior to april 12 1999 as a division of pactiv and not as a separate standalone entity from its formation in january 1999 and through the closing of the acquisition on april 12 1999 pca did not have any significant operations 

the april 12 1999 acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets purchase accounting was not applied because under the applicable accounting guidance a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 are set forth the below 

   

net sales 

net sales increased by 1546 million or 89 for the year ended december 31 2004 from the year ended december 31 2003 net sales increased due to improved sales volumes and prices of corrugated products and containerboard compared to 2003 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 66 to 299 billion square feet in 2004 compared to 281 billion square feet in 2003 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 70 in 2004 from 2003 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing in shipmentsperworkday our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2004 had one less workday 251 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2003 252 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 68 to 475000 tons for the year ended december 31 2004 from 445000 tons in 2003 

income before interest and taxes 

income before interest and taxes increased by 436 million or 451 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 2003 included in income before interest and taxes for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 is income of 278 million net of expenses attributable to a dividend paid to pca by southern timber venture llc stv the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a 31 1 ¤ 3  ownership interest included in income before interest and taxes for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 is a 33 million charge for fees and expenses related to the company’s debt refinancing which was completed in july 2003 and a fourth quarter charge of 160 million to settle certain benefits related matters with pactiv corporation dating back to april 12 1999 when pca became a standalone company as described below

during the fourth quarter of 2003 pactiv notified pca that we owed pactiv additional amounts for hourly pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating back to april 12 1999 a settlement of 160 million was negotiated between pactiv and pca in december 2003 the full amount of the settlement was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003 

excluding these special items operating income decreased 34 million in 2004 compared to 2003 the 34 million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to increased energy costs including transportation 192 million higher recycled and wood fiber costs 167 million increased salary expenses related to annual increases and new hires 57 million and increased contractual hourly labor costs 56 million which was partially offset by increased sales volume and sales prices of 443 million 

gross profit decreased 02 million or 01 for the year ended december 31 2004 from the year ended december 31 2003 gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 172 of sales in 2003 to 158 of sales in the current year primarily due to the cost increases described above 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2004 decreased by 16 million or 35 from the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing 33 million incurred in 2003 partially offset by increased salaries 8 million and higher professional fees primarily related to audits of internal controls 07 million 

selling and administrative expenses increased 86 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2004 from the comparable period in 2003 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense 42 million and related fringe benefits 10 million higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements 11 million increased travel entertainment and promotional expenses 09 million increased broker commissions 06 million and higher recruiting relocation and training costs 06 million 

other expense net decreased 62 million or 500 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in charges on disposal and transfer costs of fixed assets and facility closure costs of 33 million reduced legal charges of 15 million and a reduction in expenses of 14 million consisting of individually insignificant items 

interest expense and income taxes 

interest expense decreased in 2004 by 922 million or 757 from 2003 this decrease included 733 million of expenses related to the company’s debt refinancing which was completed in july 2003 the 733 million of expenses consisted of 559 million paid in premiums for the tender of the 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes and a 174 million noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the 9 5 ¤ 8  notes and pca’s original revolving credit facility excluding the 733 million charge interest expense was 189 million lower than in 2003 as a result of lower interest rates attributable to the company’s july 2003 refinancing and lower debt levels

pca’s effective tax rate was 380 for the year ended december 31 2004 and 423 for the year ended december 31 2003 the higher tax rate in 2003 is due to stable permanent items over lower book income loss for both years 2004 and 2003 tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002 

the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 are set forth below 

   

net sales 

net sales decreased by 04 million or 00 for the year ended december 31 2003 from the year ended december 31 2002 net sales increased due to improved sales volumes compared to 2002 however this increase was entirely offset by lower sales prices 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 21 to 281 billion square feet in 2003 compared to 275 billion square feet in 2002 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 17 in 2003 from 2002 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the lower percentage increase was due to the fact that 2003 had one more workday 252 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2002 251 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 67 to 445000 tons for the year ended december 31 2003 from 477000 tons in the comparable period of 2002

gross profit decreased 268 million or 82 for the year ended december 31 2003 from the year ended december 31 2002 gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 187 of sales in 2002 to 172 of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price decreases and energy and wood cost increases described above 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2003 increased by 55 million or 135 from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing 33 million increased depreciation and amortization expense  08 million and an increase in pension costs 07 million 

selling and administrative expenses decreased 29 million or 22 for the year ended december 31 2003 from the comparable period in 2002 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased travel and meeting costs 13 million lower recruiting and relocation expenses 07 million reduced salary costs 05 million and a reduction in training costs 05 million 

other expense net increased 19 million or 184 for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 primarily due to a 16 million increase in the company’s legal reserve 

interest expense and income taxes

pca’s effective tax rate was 423 for the year ended december 31 2003 and 379 for the year ended december 31 2002 the 2003 increase in the tax rate is due to stable permanent items over lower book income loss the tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

   

operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 295 million or 121 to 2153 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was the result of higher working capital requirements of 654 million partially offset by higher net income and increased deferred income taxes as a result of the higher income levels in 2004 the higher working capital requirements were driven by a 130 million payment to pactiv in january 2004 for a fourth quarter 2003 negotiated settlement of pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating back to april 12 1999 the date tenneco packaging now known as pactiv sold us to pca holdings llc this payment was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003 additionally pca paid pactiv 100 million of which 75 million was accrued at december 31 2003 in april 2004 as final payment for pca’s participation in pactiv’s salaried pension plan the higher working capital levels were also driven by unfavorable changes in accounts payable 131 million accrued liabilities 50 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets 121 million primarily due to a federal income tax refund received in 2003 as well as higher balances of accounts receivable 111 million in 2004 primarily due to improved sales volumes and pricing previously described and higher balances of inventory 36 million in 2004 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased 48 million or 20 to 2448 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was the result of lower working capital requirements of 340 million partially offset by lower net income as previously described and decreased deferred income taxes as a result of recording a deferred tax asset related to the 2003 tax net operating loss the lower working capital requirements were primarily driven by higher accounts payable and accrued liability balances 377 million lower prepaid expenses and other current assets balance 209 million primarily due to a federal income tax refund received during 2003 partially offset by higher balances of accounts receivable 95 million related to strong fourth quarter 2003 sales volumes and higher inventory balances 151 million in 2003 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities decreased by 11 million or 09 to 1168 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of lower expenditures for property plant and equipment of 46 million a joint venture dividend of 293 million received from southern timber venture llc stv and 20 million in proceeds received from the sale of a small portion of pca’s investment in stv in 2004 partially offset by higher acquisitions in 2004 of 346 million see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding acquisitions 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 83 million or 76 to 1179 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of increased expenditures for property plant and equipment of 58 million the acquisition of the assets of one corrugated products plant for 31 million and 07 million in expenditures to establish two small sheet plants see note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding this acquisition 

as of december 31 2004 pca had commitments for capital expenditures of 552 million pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 572 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 290 million or 336 from the comparable period in 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to 40 million in debt prepayments in 2004 compared to 941 million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in 2003 and stock repurchases of 175 million made in 2003 this was partially offset by dividend payments on pca’s common stock of 637 million in 2004 and the 140 million in proceeds that pca netted from the debt refinancing in 2003 described below 

net cash used for financing activities increased by 46 million or 56 to 862 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to 941 million in debt prepayments in 2003 compared to 531 million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in 2002 this was partially offset by lower stock repurchases of 155 million that pca made in 2003 compared to 2002 and higher proceeds received from stock option exercises of 72 million in 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 in addition pca also netted 140 million in proceeds from the debt refinancing described below 

in connection with the debt refinancing in july 2003 pca received proceeds net of discount of 5958 million from its notes offering and new senior credit facility and 270 million from settlement of the treasury lock which it used to complete the tender offer of its 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes in the amount of 6023 million including the premium pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of 69 million in connection with the debt refinancing

pca holds a 31 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in southern timber venture llc in 2004 2003 and 2002 pca received dividends from southern timber venture llc of 293 million 169 million net of taxes and expenses 12 million 07 million aftertax and 23 million 14 million aftertax respectively

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on october 31 2003 pca renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional threeyear term expiring on october 10 2006 as of december 31 2004 1090 million was outstanding and 410 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2004 was 1090 million 

on july 7 2003 pca repaid all borrowings under its thenexisting senior credit facility this facility was replaced with a senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a 1000 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit and a 500 million term loan the senior credit facility closed on july 21 2003 and it expires in 2008 pca’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2004 consisted of 390 million of term loans 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes on july 22 2003 pca used the net proceeds from the offering together with the borrowings under the senior credit facility and cash on hand to purchase 5464 million or 993 of its then outstanding 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes as a result of these transactions pca recorded a onetime charge of approximately 766 million 467 million aftertax in the third quarter of 2003 the 766 million charge includes the tender offer premium of 559 million and a 174 million noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees due to the early extinguishment of debt which are included in interest expense and fees and expenses of 33 million which are included in corporate overhead as required by their terms the 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in december 2003 the remaining senior subordinated notes were repurchased on april 1 2004

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2004 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2004 

   

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 34 million at december 31 2004 interest payments on debt outstanding and pca’s pension contributions of 204 million to be made in 2005 pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2005 

the lease commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2004 see notes 7 and 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2004 pca had 1410 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements pca’s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures debt service and common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2004 for each of pca’s outstanding term loans the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility 

   

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 34 million at december 31 2004 it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments the noncash income from the annual amortization of the 270 million received in july 2003 from the settlement of the treasury locks related to the five and ten year notes the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the five and tenyear notes 

the borrowings under the senior credit facility are available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the term loan must be repaid in quarterly installments from july 2006 through 2008 the senior credit facility will terminate in july 2008 the receivables credit facility will terminate in october 2006 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates or

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition we must maintain minimum net worth maximum leverage and minimum ebitda to interest ratios under the senior credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit facility 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 1100 million to 1150 million in 2005 these capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities and available cashonhand will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures common stock dividend payments and working capital needs for the next 12 months and that net cash generated from operating activities and amounts available under the revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under its receivables credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures common stock dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future pca’s future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

·   resource conservation and recovery act rcra

·   clean water act cwa

·   clean air act caa

·   the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra

·   toxic substance control act tsca

·   safe drinking water act sdwa

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2004 we spent approximately  151 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 124 million and 115 million respectively 

in addition the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk mills the cluster rules affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances under the terms of the contribution agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from january 1994 through december 2004 remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants totaled about 31 million as of december 31 2004 we maintained an environmental reserve of 57 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 93 million for 2004 and we currently estimate 2005 environmental capital expenditures will be 141 million of which 30 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 57 million accrued as of december 31 2004 will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact of inflation 

pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation we 

base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

accounts receivable—allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 03 for amounts less than 90 days past due and 30 for amounts more than 90 days past due based on our historical collection experience if our collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 

the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns allowances and earned discounts based on our experience customer returns allowances and earned discounts have averaged 10 of our gross selling price accordingly we reserve 10 of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items

as of december 31 2004 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions reserve was 46 million compared to 53 million at december 31 2003 bad debt expense in 2004 was 04 million compared to 18 million in 2003 the 14 million decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction of 12 million in the amount of accounts receivable balance that was deemed uncollectable in 2004 compared to 2003  for the year ended december 31 2003 bad debt expense was 18 million compared to 30 million in 2002 the decrease of 12 million was primarily attributable to one customer that filed for bankruptcy during 2002 resulting in bad debt expense of 13 million  

inventories 

we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods valued using the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market method comprised 66 and 67 of inventories at current cost at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

pension and postretirement benefits 

the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” we account for our postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time 

however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 

the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates available on highquality fixedincome debt instruments on december 31 of each year the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used for pension accounting and is determined by the company based upon annual reviews 

for postretirement health care plan accounting our company reviews external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions 

environmental liabilities 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost is capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset the adoption of sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 did not have a material impact on pca’s financial statements 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however our estimates may change we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in revenue in addition pca offers volume rebates to some of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to revenue at the time of the respective sale 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes as of december 31 2004 pca was not party to any derivatives 

as the interest rates on approximately 79 of pca’s debt are fixed a one percent increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 15 million annually for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the weighted average libor was 256 and 119 respectively and the weighted average commercial paper rate was 233 and 111 respectively in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure

based upon their evaluation as of december 31 2004 pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to pca is made known to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer particularly during the periods when pca’s periodic reports are being prepared 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

pca’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations pca’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

industry overview 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was over 22 billion in 2003 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below 

   

corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the corrugated products industry consists of approximately 650 companies in the united states 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or 

liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required by converters and shipped to them 

linerboard is made in a range of grades or basis weights the most commonly used basis weight of linerboard is 35 lb although linerboard is produced in weights that vary from under 26 lb to over 90 lb basis weight represents the weight in pounds per thousand square feet of linerboard producers also market linerboard by performance characteristics appearance and color 

pca operations and products 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb to 47 lb all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

counce   our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the united states its production capacity is approximately 980000 tons per year in 2003 we produced 963000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce we produced a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard

valdosta   our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 430000 tons per year in 2003 our single paper machine at valdosta produced 425000 tons of kraft linerboard valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb to 90 lb

tomahawk   our tomahawk wisconsin mill is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the united states with production capacity of 556000 tons per year in 2003 we produced 553000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on three paper machines one of which is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world these machines produce a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 40 lb our tomahawk mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium

filer city   our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill currently operating with two machines with a production capacity of 292000 tons in 2003 we produced 291000 tons of corrugating medium in july 1998 we shut down one machine at filer city mill production capacity at filer city is 362000 tons a year if we run all three paper machines filer city produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb to 40 lb

we operate 66 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center five regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 66 manufacturing facilities 40 operate as combining operations commonly called corrugated plants that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 26 manufacturing facilities commonly called sheet plants purchase combined sheets primarily produced at pca’s combining operations and manufacture finished corrugated containers the five graphic design centers are located in cincinnati ohio dallas texas cranbury new jersey salisbury north carolina and south gate california 

our corrugated manufacturing operations are spread throughout the united states each corrugator plant serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugator plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 115000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of our mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber most of these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold about 800000 acres of timberland as part of the timberland sale agreements we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600000 acres of the total acres sold we also retained a onethird equity ownership interest in 385000 acres sold to southern timber venture llc in 2000 

in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 125000 acres by supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include over 215000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest approximately 85000 cords of wood from these forests annually 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative which is organized by the american forest and paper association this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

solid wood facilities 

during 2003 we owned and operated three sawmills located in ackerman and fulton mississippi and selmer tennessee during 2003 these three sawmills sold 125 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and building products we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries 

on february 2 2004 we sold our selmer tennessee sawmill this facility produced and sold 10 million board feet of lumber in 2003 with net sales of 45 million 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization sales representatives and a sales manager at each converting operations facility serve local and regional accounts corporate account managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order 

processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize support personnel that are new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugator plants as well as the graphic design centers 

distribution 

our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we do use some thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage 

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 8300 customers in over 15000 locations about 70 of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply   fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources with the exception of our valdosta mill our other mills can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated products plants generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2003 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 601000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 194000 tons of recycled fiber as a result pca was a net recycled fiber buyer of 407000 tons or 18 of our total fiber requirements an increase of 2 from 2002 the 2 increase in recycled fiber use was primarily to reduce the use of higher cost wood fiber

energy supply   energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility historically natural gas and fuel oil have shown more price volatility than coal and purchased bark during 2003 119 million m 2 btu’s million btu’s or approximately 70 of our mills’ purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 15 million m 2 btu’s of natural gas 9 of the mills’ total purchased fuels and 27 million m 2 btu’s of fuel oil 17 of the mills’ total purchased fuels

our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately 70 of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts approximately 45 to 50 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite 

pca’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2003 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 16 million m 2 btu’s of natural gas 

competition 

corrugated products are produced by about 650 us companies operating approximately 1400 plants most corrugated products are custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include georgiapacific corporation international paper company smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we believe we compete as much with the smaller independent converters as with the larger integrated producers 

our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including georgiapacific corporation international paper company smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 7900 employees approximately 2100 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5800 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions our unionized employees are represented primarily by the paper allied industrial chemical energy workers international union the international association of machinists the graphic communications international union and the united steel workers of america uswa 

the contract for our unionized mill employees at our valdosta georgia kraft linerboard mill expired in september 2003 and we are currently operating under the expired contract contracts for unionized mill employees at our three remaining containerboard mills expire between october 2005 and june 2007 contracts for unionized converting plant employees expire between june 2004 and august 2009 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

during 2003 we experienced no work stoppages in 2001 we experienced a onemonth strike at our filer city mill with the uswa the strike was settled and the mill’s current agreement expires in may 2006 prior to this incident we had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2003 we spent approximately 124 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 115 million and 114 million respectively we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

in april 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized a new clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster rules which govern all pulp and paper mill operations including those at our mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants as a result pca and its competitors are required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules from 1997 through 2003 we spent approximately 343 million on cluster rule compliance to meet clean air act requirements total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 165 million for 2003 we currently estimate 2004 environmental capital expenditures will be 100 million  of which 09 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements our current spending projections to complete all cluster rule compliance requirements at our four mills is about 122 million which will be spent between 2004 and 2006 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2003 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 31 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2003 we maintained an environmental reserve of 43 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects of the 43 million reserve 33 million is reserved for our landfill obligations which are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” we believe these reserves are adequate 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

as a part of the april 12 1999 transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 43 million accrued as of december 31 2003 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

   we have operated only two of our three paper machines at filer city since july 1998 reducing the total productive capacity by 70000 tons to 292000 tons and to 2258000 tons for our total mill containerboard system

we currently own all four containerboard mills and 43 of our corrugated manufacturing operations we also own two sawmills an airdrying yard one warehouse and miscellaneous other property which includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices these sales offices and woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative offices pca leases the space for two corrugated plants 21 sheet plants five regional design centers and numerous other distribution centers warehouses and facilities the equipment in these leased facilities is in virtually all cases owned by pca except for forklifts and other rolling stock which is generally leased

we currently lease space for our executive and administrative offices in lake forest illinois under a lease expiring in january 2005 we currently believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 




 item 3   legal proceedings

on may 14 1999 pca was named as a defendant in two consolidated class action complaints which alleged a civil violation of section 1 of the sherman act the suits then captioned winoff industries inc v stone container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa and general refractories co v gaylord container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa name pca as a defendant based solely on the allegation that pca is successor to the interests of tenneco packaging inc and tenneco inc both of which were also named as defendants in the suits along with nine other linerboard and corrugated sheet manufacturers the complaints allege that the defendants during the period october 1 1993 through november 30 1995 conspired to limit the supply of linerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of corrugated containers and corrugated sheets respectively on november 3 2003 pactiv formerly known as tenneco packaging tenneco and pca entered into an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits the settlement agreement which is subject to court approval provides for a full release of all claims against pca as a result of the class action lawsuits a hearing is set for march 2004 regarding the settlement approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class and together filed about ten direct action complaints in various federal courts across the country all of the optout complaints make allegations against the defendants including pca substantially similar to those made in the class actions the settlement agreement does not cover these direct action cases these actions have almost all been consolidated as in re linerboard  mdl 1261 ed pa for pretrial purposes fact discovery is proceeding and is currently set to close september 30 2004 as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably 

possible that the outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

pca is also party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business as of the date of this filing we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

in connection with the april 12 1999 transactions pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the “group” formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc the group operated prior to april 12 1999 as a division of pactiv and not as a separate standalone entity from its formation in january 1999 and through the closing of the acquisition on april 12 1999 pca did not have any significant operations 

the april 12 1999 acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets purchase accounting was not applied because under the applicable accounting guidance a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 

results of operations 

the historical results of operations of pca are set forth below 

   

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002 

net sales 

net sales decreased by 03 million or 00 for the year ended december 31 2003 from the year ended december 31 2002 net sales increased due to improved sales volumes compared to 2002 however this increase was entirely offset by lower sales prices 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 21 to 281 billion square feet in 2003 compared to 275 billion square feet in 2002 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 17 in 2003 from 2002 shipmentsperworkday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year the lower percentage increase was due to the fact that 2003 had one more workday 252 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2002 251 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 67 to 445000 tons for the year ended december 31 2003 from 477000 tons in the comparable period of 2002 

income before interest expense and income taxes operating income 

operating income decreased by 484 million or 333 for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 2002 included in income before interest and taxes for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 is a 33 million charge for fees and expenses related to the company’s debt refinancing which was completed in july 2003 and a fourth quarter charge of 160 million to settle certain benefits related matters with pactiv corporation dating back to april 12 1999 when pca became a standalone company the remaining 291 million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to decreased sales prices 134 million and increased costs of energy 79 million and wood costs 48 million 

gross profit decreased 268 million or 82 for the year ended december 31 2003 from the year ended december 31 2002 gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 187 of sales in 2002 to 172 of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price decreases and energy and wood cost increases described above 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2003 increased by 55 million or 135 from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing 33 million increased depreciation and amortization expense  08 million and an increase in pension costs 07 million 

selling and administrative expenses decreased 29 million or 22 for the year ended december 31 2003 from the comparable period in 2002 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased travel and meeting costs 13 million lower recruiting and relocation expenses 07 million reduced salary costs 05 million and a reduction in training costs 05 million 

other expense net increased 191 million or 2365 for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 including the 160 million charge discussed above for the settlement of benefit cost related matters with pactiv corporation in addition the company’s legal reserve increased 16 million during 2003 and the company received lower dividend payments from southern timber venture llc 12 million 

interest expense and income taxes 

interest expense increased in 2003 by 541 million or 799 from the comparable period in 2002 this increase included 733 million of expenses related to the company’s debt refinancing which was completed in july 2003 the 733 million of expenses consisted of 559 million paid in premiums for the 

tender of the 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes and a 174 million noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the 9 5 ¤ 8  notes and pca’s original revolving credit facility dated as of april 12 1999 and amended and restated as of june 29 2000 excluding the 733 million charge interest expense was 192 million lower than in 2002 as a result of lower interest rates attributable to the company’s july 2003 refinancing and lower debt levels

pca’s effective tax rate was 423 for the year ended december 31 2003 and 379 for the year ended december 31 2002 the 2003 increase in the tax rate is due to stable permanent items over lower book income loss the tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

year ended december 31 2002 compared to year ended december 31 2001 

net sales 

net sales decreased by 541 million or 30 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard partially offset by increased corrugated products volume and slightly higher volume of containerboard sold to third parties 

total corrugated products volume sold increased 35 to 275 billion square feet in 2002 compared to 265 billion square feet in 2001 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products sales volume increased 39 in 2002 from 2001 the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2001 had one more workday 252 days those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2002 251 days containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 114 to 477000 tons for the year ended december 31 2002 from 428000 tons in the comparable period of 2001 

income before interest expense and income taxes operating income 

operating income decreased by 1042 million or 418 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 2001 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices 978 million increased costs for recycled fiber at our containerboard mills 109 million higher medical 75 million and pension 23 million costs and increased depreciation expense 79 million which were only partially offset by increased volume 238 million 

gross profit decreased 912 million or 219 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the year ended december 31 2001 gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 232 of sales in 2001 to 187 of sales in 2002 primarily due to the sales price decreases described above 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2002 increased by 04 million or 11 from the year ended december 31 2001 

selling and administrative expenses increased 88 million or 72 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the comparable period in 2001 the increase was primarily the result of increased benefit costs of 29 million increased expenditures of 26 million for other general selling related expenses which were individually insignificant and an increase in salary expense of 23 million 

other expense net increased 38 million or 874 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the increase was primarily due to an increase in the loss on disposal of assets of 33 million 

interest expense and income taxes 

interest expense decreased by 74 million or 98 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the comparable period in 2001 primarily due to prepayments pca made in 2001 and 2002 on the term loans 

under its senior credit facility and the receivables credit facility and a 1 million writeoff in deferred financing fees in 2001 due to the debt prepayments 

pca’s effective tax rate was 379 for the year ended december 31 2002 and 387 for the year ended december 31 2001 the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased 49 million or 20 to 2449 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was the result of lower working capital requirements of 301 million partially offset by lower net income as previously described and decreased deferred income taxes as a result of recording a deferred tax asset related to the 2003 tax net operating loss the lower working capital requirements were primarily driven by higher accounts payable balances lower prepaid expenses and other current assets balance due to a federal income tax refund received during 2003 partially offset by higher balances of accounts receivable related to strong fourth quarter 2003 sales volumes and higher inventory balances in 2003 

cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 743 million or 236 to 2400 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease was primarily due to lower net income decreased deferred income taxes and higher working capital requirements the increased working capital requirements were primarily driven by higher accounts receivable balances resulting from stronger sales volumes previously described partially offset by lower inventory levels and a smaller reduction of the accounts payable balance than in 2001 

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities increased by 83 million or 76 to 1179 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of increased expenditures for property plant and equipment of 58 million the acquisition of the assets of one corrugated products plant for 31 million and 07 million in expenditures to establish two small sheet plants see note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding this acquisition 

cash used for investing activities decreased by 253 million or 187 to 1096 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of decreased expenditures for property plant and equipment of 238 million partially offset by the acquisition for 48 million of a corrugated products plant in the second quarter of 2001 see note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding this acquisition 

as of december 31 2003 pca had commitments for capital expenditures of 375 million pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

cash used for financing activities increased by 47 million or 57 to 862 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to 941 million in debt prepayments in 2003 compared to 531 million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in 2002 this was partially offset by lower stock repurchases of 155 million that pca made in 2003 compared to 2002 and higher proceeds received from stock option 

exercises of 72 million in 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 in addition pca also netted 140 million in proceeds from the debt refinancing described below 

in connection with the debt refinancing in july pca received proceeds net of discount of 5958 million from its notes offering and new senior credit facility and 270 million from settlement of the treasury locks in july which it used to complete the tender offer of its 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes in the amount of 6023 million including the premium pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of 69 million in connection with the debt refinancing

cash used for financing activities decreased by 233 million or 222 to 816 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 primarily attributable to decreased prepayments made by pca on its various debt agreements of 212 million and a decrease in expenditures to repurchase pca common stock of 53 million 

on january 28 2000 pca became a publicly traded company with an initial public offering of its common stock on march 3 2000 pca used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of 12 3 ¤ 8  senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010

pca holds a 33 1 ¤ 3  equity ownership interest in southern timber venture llc in 2003 and 2002 pca received dividends from southern timber venture llc of 12 million 07 million aftertax and 23 million 14 million aftertax respectively

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times on october 31 2003 pca renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional threeyear term this facility will terminate on october 10 2006 as of december 31 2003 1090 million was outstanding and 410 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2003 was 1130 million 

on june 23 2003 pca launched a tender offer for any and all of its outstanding 5500 million aggregate principal amount of 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes due 2009 in connection with the tender offer pca also solicited consents to adopt amendments to the indenture under which the 9 5 ¤ 8  notes were issued to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and several of the event of default provisions in the indenture the consent solicitation expired on july 7 2003 and the tender offer expired on july 21 2003 holders of approximately 5463 million or 993 in aggregate principal amount of 9 5 ¤ 8  notes consented to the proposed amendments and tendered their notes in the tender offer

on july 7 2003 pca repaid all borrowings under its thenexisting senior credit facility this facility was replaced with a new senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a new 1000 million revolving credit facility including a 350 million subfacility for letters of credit and a new 500 million term loan the new senior credit facility closed on july 21 2003 and it expires in 2008 pca’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2003 consisted of 390 million of term loans 

on july 21 2003 pca closed its offering and private placement of 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes on july 22 2003 pca used the net proceeds from the offering together with the borrowings under the new senior credit facility and cash on hand to purchase 5464 million or 993 of its outstanding 9 5 ¤ 8  senior subordinated notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment in the tender offer that expired at midnight on july 21 2003 as a result of these transactions pca recorded a onetime charge of approximately 766 million 467 million aftertax in the third quarter of 2003 the 766 million charge includes the tender offer premium of 559 million and a 174 million noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees due to the early extinguishment of debt which are included in interest expense and fees and expenses of 33 million which are included in corporate overhead as required by their terms the 1500 million of 4 3 ¤ 8  fiveyear notes and 4000 million of 5 3 ¤ 4  tenyear notes were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in december 2003 the remaining senior subordinated notes are callable beginning april 1 2004 at 1048125 on march 1 2004 the company delivered an irrevocable notice to the trustee to redeem these notes on april 1 2004

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2003 that would require disclosure under sec fr67 “disclosure in management’s discussion and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2003 

   

the above table excludes an unamortized debt discount of 39 million at december 31 2003 and pca’s pension contributions for plan years 2003 and 2004 of 93 million to be made in 2004 pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2004 

the lease commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2003 see notes 6 and 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under pca’s senior revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under pca’s receivables credit facility as of december 31 2003 pca had 1410 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit 

agreements pca’s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures debt service and common stock dividends which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2003 for each of pca’s outstanding term loans the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility 

   

the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of 39 million at december 31 2003 it also excludes the impact from the annual cash interest payments of the settlement of the treasury locks related to the five and ten year notes of 270 million received in july 2003 

the borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility are available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the term loan must be repaid in quarterly installments from july 2006 through 2008 the senior revolving credit facility will terminate in july 2008 the receivables credit facility will terminate in october 2006 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates or

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition we must maintain minimum net worth maximum leverage and minimum ebitda to interest ratios under the senior credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit facility 

pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of 1100 millionto 1150 millionin 2004 these capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities and available cashonhand will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures common stock dividend payments and working capital needs for the next 12 months and that net cash generated from operating 

activities and amounts available under the senior revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under its receivables credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures common stock dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future pca’s future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater the most significant of these laws affecting us are 

·   resource conservation and recovery act rcra

·   clean water act cwa

·   clean air act caa

·   the emergency planning and community righttoknowact epcra

·   toxic substance control act tsca

·   safe drinking water act sdwa

we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws for the year ended december 31 2003 we spent approximately  124 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 the costs of environmental compliance were approximately 115 million and 114 million respectively 

in addition the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances under the terms of the contribution agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from january 1994 through december 2003 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 31 million as of december 31 2003 we maintained an environmental reserve of 43 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 165 million for 2003 and we currently estimate 2004 environmental capital expenditures will be 100 million of which 09 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster 

rule requirements as of this filing we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the 43 million accrued as of december 31 2003 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

impact of inflation 

pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

accounts receivable—allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 03 for amounts less than 90 days past due and 30 for amounts more than 90 days past due based on our historical collection experience if our collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 

as of december 31 2003 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 53 million compared to 58 million at december 31 2002 bad debt expense in 2003 was 18 million compared to 30 million in 2002 the 12 million decreasewas primarily attributable to one customer that filed for bankruptcy during 2002 resulting in bad debt expense of 13 million  for the year ended december 31 2002 bad debt expense was 30 million compared to 07 million in 2001 during 2002 17 million of bad debt expense was recorded related to three customers that filed for bankruptcy during the year 

inventory 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required raw materials 

work in process and finished goods are valued using the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market method supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

derivatives 

we have historically held derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting as discussed in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements we do not speculate in derivatives trading hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting if hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 

to hedge interest rate risk interest rate collars are used to protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee minimum interest rates related to our variable rate debt these instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and cash payments the cash receipts and cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change information about the fair values notional amounts and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in notes 6 and 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements and the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included elsewhere in this report 

in addition to the above derivative financial instruments we have other contracts covering a portion of our purchases of natural gas and electricity that have the characteristics of derivatives but are not required to be accounted for as derivatives these contracts for the physical delivery of these items qualify for the normal purchases exception under sfas no 133 as we take physical delivery of the item and use it in the production process this exception is an election and if not elected these contracts would be carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income pca has elected the normal purchases exception under sfas no 133 additional information regarding these contracts can be found in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

environmental liabilities 

pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which became effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 the statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a liability that cost should be capitalized as part of the related longlived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset the adoption of sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 did not have a material impact on pca’s financial statements 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however our estimates may change we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites 

associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales shipping and handling billings to a customer in a sales transaction are included in revenue in addition pca offers volume rebates to some of its customers the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to revenue at the time of the respective sale 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value were required

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes as of december 31 2003 pca did not have any derivatives 




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures

there were no changes in or disagreements with pca’s accountants during 2003 or 2002 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

pca’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the evaluation of pca’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design pca’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k 

during the quarter ended december 31 2003 there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect pca’s internal control over financial reporting 

based upon their evaluation as of december 31 2003 pca’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that pca’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to pca is made known to management including the chief executive 

officer and chief financial officer particularly during the periods when pca’s periodic reports are being prepared

general 

packaging corporation of america or pca is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states based on production capacity as reported in the pulp  paper 2002 north american fact book with 2002 net sales of 17 billion pca produced about 22 million tons of containerboard about 80 of which was consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants and shipped about 275 billion square feet bsf of corrugated products 

containerboard production and corrugated shipments 

   

in 2002 we produced about 14 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills located in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia we also produced about 08 million tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills located in tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 140000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills we also have supply agreements on about 600000 of the 800000 acres of timberland we sold during 1999 and 2000 

our converting operations produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods we also produce multicolor boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations finally we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated boxes for the agricultural industry 

corporate developments 

on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm in january 1999 for 22 billion consisting of 2465 million in cash the assumption of 17600 million of debt incurred by pactiv immediately prior to the contribution and a 45 common equity interest in pca valued at 1935 million pca holdings llc an entity organized and controlled by madison dearborn acquired the remaining 55 common equity interest in pca for 2365 million in cash which was used to finance in part the transactions 

the financing of the transactions consisted of 1 borrowings under a new 14690 million senior credit facility for which jp morgan securities inc and bt alex brown incorporated the predecessor to deutsche banc alex brown were colead arrangers 2 the offering of 5500 million of 9 5  8  senior subordinated notes due 2009 and 1000 million of 12 3  8  senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010 3 a cash equity investment of 2365 million by pca holdings llc and 4 an equity investment by pactiv valued at 1935 million as required by their terms the 5500 million of senior subordinated notes and 1000 million of senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the april 12 1999 transactions were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in october 1999 

the senior credit facility was entered into to finance in part the transactions and to pay related fees and expenses and to provide future borrowings to pca for general corporate purposes including working capital the senior credit facility initially consisted of three term loan facilities in an original aggregate principal amount of 12190 million and a revolving credit facility with up to 2500 million in availability effective december 14 1999 pca elected to reduce its availability under the revolving credit facility from 2500 million to 1500 million 

on january 28 2000 pca became a publiclytraded company with the initial public offering of its common stock in the offering pactiv sold 35000000 shares and pca sold 11250000 new shares of common stock both at an offering price of 1200 per share pca used its net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock on march 3 2000 

pca completed the refinancing of its 7350 million senior secured debt and 1500 million senior secured revolving credit facility on june 29 2000 completion of the refinancing eliminated a 2265 million term loan and reduced pca’s average effective interest rate on its senior secured term debt by approximately 100 basis points pca’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2002 consisted of 790 million of term loans no amounts were outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility as of that date 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times as of december 31 2002 1130 million was outstanding and 370 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2002 was 1260 million 

during 2001 pactiv sold approximately 6160240 shares of pca common stock which represented its remaining ownership interest 

industry overview 

according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was over 22 billion in 2002 

the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below 

   

converting plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs the corrugated products industry consists of approximately 675 companies in the united states 

containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products 

containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak the finished paper product is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required by converters and shipped to them 

linerboard is made in a range of grades or basis weights the most commonly used basis weight of linerboard is 35 lb although linerboard is produced in weights that vary from under 26 lb to over 90 lb basis weight represents the weight in pounds per thousand square feet of linerboard producers also market linerboard by performance characteristics appearance and color the following table describes different product weight performance and color characteristics 

   

historically pricing for containerboard has reflected changes in containerboard supply as well as changes in demand 

pca operations and products 

our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb to 47 lb all four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002 certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and customer service 

counce our counce tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the united states its production capacity is approximately 980000 tons per year in 2002 we produced approximately 966000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at counce we produced a broad range of basis weights from 31 lb to 90 lb the mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard including highring crush and wet strength

valdosta our valdosta georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 406000 tons per year in 2002 our single paper machine at valdosta produced approximately 425000 tons of kraft linerboard linerboard production for 2002 exceeded the stated capacity of the mill due to an unusually high percentage of middleweight production valdosta produces light to middleweight linerboard ranging from 35 lb to 56 lb and heavyweightsuper heavyweight linerboard ranging from 61 lb to 90 lb

tomahawk our tomahawk wisconsin mill is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the united states with production capacity of 547000 tons per year in 2002 we produced approximately 533000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium on three paper machines one of which is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world these machines produce a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb to 40 lb our tomahawk mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium this includes high ring crush wet strength tare weight and super heavyweight

filer city our filer city michigan mill is a semichemical corrugating medium mill currently operating with two machines with a production capacity of 292000 tons in 2002 we produced approximately 281000 tons of corrugating medium in july 1998 we shut down one machine at filer city mill production capacity at filer city is 362000 tons a year if we run all three paper machines filer city produces a range of corrugating medium grades in basis weights from 23 lb to 40 lb

we operate 64 corrugated manufacturing operations a technical and development center five regional graphic design centers a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers of the 64 manufacturing facilities 39 operate as combining operations that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers the remaining 25 manufacturing facilities purchase combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated containers the five graphic design centers are located in cincinnati ohio dallas texas cranbury new jersey salisbury north carolina and south gate california 

our corrugated manufacturing operations are spread throughout the united states each corrugator plant serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugator plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items 

we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging 

timberland 

we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 140000 acres of timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of our mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber most of these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining 

during 1999 and 2000 pca sold about 800000 acres of timberland as part of the timberland sale agreements we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600000 acres of the total acres sold we also retained a onethird equity ownership interest in 385000 acres sold to southern timber venture llc in november 2000 

in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 120000 acres by supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right of first refusal over timber 

sales from those lands these private lands include over 210000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest approximately 85000 cords of wood from these forests annually 

pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative which is organized by the american forest and paper association this initiative is aimed at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of america’s forestry resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams 

solid wood and recycling facilities 

we own three sawmills located in ackerman and fulton mississippi and selmer tennessee during 2002 these three sawmills sold approximately 115 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and building products we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries 

we also operate two paper recycling centers one in jackson tennessee and one in nashville tennessee these recycling centers collect old corrugated containers newspapers and other paper that provide a source of recycled fiber to our nearby counce mill 

sales and marketing 

our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization sales representatives and a sales manager at each converting operations facility serve local and regional accounts corporate account managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics sales force general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters 

our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants to other domestic customers and to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator plants these personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers 

in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize support personnel that are new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugator plants as well as the graphic design centers 

distribution 

our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius 

containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we do use some thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage 

customers 

pca’s corrugated products group sells to over 8300 customers in over 14600 locations about 70 of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations the remaining 30 of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the united states 

in 2002 our corrugated products plants consumed approximately 1752000 tons or 80 of our mills’ containerboard production of the remaining 20 of our containerboard mill production that we did not consume at our own converting operations about 12 of the tons was sold to domestic customers and about 8 of the tons was sold to export customers 

major raw materials used 

fiber supply fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard pca consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills we have no 100 recycled mills or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood hardwood and recycled sources with the exception of our valdosta mill our other mills can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers our corrugated products plants generate recycled fiber as a byproduct from the manufacturing process which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements during 2002 our containerboard mills consumed approximately 554000 tons of recycled fiber of which about 198000 tons was generated from our own box plants resulting in net recycled consumption of 356000 tons or 16 of our total fiber requirements

energy supply energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels which are converted to steam or electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil internally produced and purchased bark and byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity to reduce our mill energy cost we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility historically natural gas and fuel oil have shown more price volatility than coal and purchased bark during 2002 118 million m 2 btu’s million btu’s or approximately 70 of our mills purchased fuel needs were from purchased bark and coal historically our two lowest cost fuels for the same period our mills consumed about 30 million m 2 btu’s of natural gas and 19 million m 2 btu’s of fuel oil

our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately 65 to 70 of their fuel requirements from their own byproducts approximately 45 to 50 of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated onsite 

pca’s corrugated products combining plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator the majority of these boilers burn natural gas although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil during 2002 pca’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately 21 million m 2 btu’s of natural gas 

competition 

corrugated products are produced by about 675 us companies operating approximately 1425 plants most corrugated products are custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a 150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions 

the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts 

corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both local and national account business and we compete 

against producers of other types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include georgiapacific corporation international paper company smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we believe we compete as much with the smaller independent converters as with the larger integrated producers 

our principal competitors with respect to our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper companies including georgiapacific corporation international paper company smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc and weyerhaeuser company as well as other regional manufacturers containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers 

employees 

as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 7900 employees approximately 2200 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5700 were hourly approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions our unionized employees are represented primarily by the paper allied industrial chemical energy workers international union the international association of machinists the graphic communications international union and the united steel workers of america uswa 

the contract for our unionized mill employees at our valdosta georgia kraft linerboard mill expires in september 2003 contracts for unionized mill employees at our three remaining containerboard mills expire between october 2005 and june 2007 contracts for unionized converting plant employees expire between february 2003 and november 2008 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future 

during 2002 we experienced no work stoppages in 2001 we experienced a onemonth strike at our filer city mill with the uswa the strike was settled and the mill’s current agreement expires in may 2006 prior to this incident we had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees 

environmental matters 

compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater we believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable environmental rules and regulations because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws we work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition 

in april 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized a new clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster rules which govern all pulp and paper mill operations including those at our mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants as a result pca and its competitors are required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules from 1997 through 2002 we spent approximately 303 million on cluster rule compliance to meet clean air act requirements total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 43 million for 2002 we currently estimate 2003 environmental capital expenditures will be 147 million of which 44 million of the 

expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements our current spending projections to complete all cluster rule compliance requirements at our four mills is about 144 million from 2003 to 2005 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from 1994 through 2002 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 29 million we do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2002 we maintained an environmental reserve of 37 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects we believe these reserves are adequate 

we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us 

as a part of the april 12 1999 transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill

 item 3   legal proceedings

on may 14 1999 pca was named as a defendant in a consolidated class action complaint which alleged a civil violation of section 1 of the sherman act the suit captioned winoff industries inc v stone container corporation  mdl no 1261 ed pa names us as a defendant based solely on the allegation that pca is successor to the interests of tenneco packaging inc and tenneco inc both of which were also named as defendants in the suit along with nine other linerboard manufacturers the complaint alleges that the defendants during the period october 1 1993 through november 30 1995 conspired to limit the supply of linerboard and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was artificially to increase prices of corrugated containers the plaintiffs have moved to certify a class of all persons in the united states who purchased corrugated containers directly from any defendant during the above period and seek treble damages and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the purported class the court granted plaintiffs’ motion on september 4 2001 but modified the proposed class to exclude those purchasers who purchased corrugated containers pursuant to contracts in which the price was “not tied to the price of linerboard” the court’s class certification decision was affirmed by the court of appeals for the third circuit on september 5 2002 the case is currently set for trial in april 2004 we believe that the plaintiffs’ allegations have no merit and intend to defend against the suit vigorously we do not believe that the 

outcome of this litigation should have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flow 

pca is also party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business we believe that the resolution of these legal actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations

the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 

overview 

in connection with the april 12 1999 transactions pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the “group” formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc the group operated prior to april 12 1999 as a division of pactiv and not as a separate standalone entity from its formation in january 1999 and through the closing of the acquisition on april 12 1999 pca did not have any significant operations 

the april 12 1999 acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets purchase accounting was not applied because under the applicable accounting guidance a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 

general 

containerboard demand is dependent upon both domestic demand for corrugated products and linerboard export activity 

according to pulp  paper week after giving effect to price changes in 2002 average midpoint prices in december 2002 for linerboard and corrugating medium east were 4 higher than december 2001 prices 

pulp  paper week in its february 17 2003 publication reported that average prices for linerboard and corrugating medium decreased 10 per ton or 2 and 15 per ton or 4 respectively compared to december 2002 levels the march 17 2003 pulp  paper week publication reported that prices remained unchanged from february 2003 levels 

results of operations 

the historical results of operations of pca are set forth below 

   

year ended december 31 2002 compared to year ended december 31 2001 

net sales 

net sales decreased by 541 million or 30 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard partially offset by increased corrugated products volume and slightly higher volume of containerboard sold to third parties 

total corrugated products volume increased 35 to 275 billion square feet in 2002 compared to 265 billion square feet in 2001 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products volume increased 39 in 2002 from 2001 the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2001 had one more workday those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2002 containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers increased 114 to 477000 tons for the year ended december 31 2002 from 428000 tons in the comparable period of 2001 our total containerboard mill production in 2002 was 2204000 tons compared to 2125000 tons in 2001 

according to pulp  paper week average industry midpoint linerboard and semichemical medium prices for 42 lb linereast and 26 lb mediumeast which are representative benchmark grades were 426 and 383 respectively per ton in 2002 this compares to 444 and 404 respectively per ton in 2001 with respect to box prices pca realized an additional 9 per ton increase in october after implementing 10 per ton increases in both august and september 

in november 2002 pulp  paper week reported that average linerboard prices for 42 lb linereast decreased 5 per ton to 435 per ton the same publication reported that prices for 26 lb mediumeast semichemical medium remained unchanged for the month at 395 per ton pulp  paper week reported no changes in linerboard or medium prices in december 

income before interest expense and income taxes operating income 

operating income decreased by 1042 million or 418 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 2001 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices which reduced operating income by 978 million plus increased costs for recycled fiber at our containerboard mills 

higher medical costs and increased depreciation expense these items were only partially offset by increased corrugated products and containerboard volume 

pca did not record any material benefit related to changes in accounting treatment of goodwill in 2002 goodwill amortization was not material for the years ended december 31 2000 and 2001 

gross profit decreased 914 million or 219 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the year ended december 31 2001 gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 233 of sales in 2001 to 188 of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price decreases described above 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2002 increased by 04 million or 11 from the year ended december 31 2001 

selling and administrative expenses increased 86 million or 69 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the comparable period in 2001 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary medical and other general selling related expenses 

interest expense and income taxes 

interest expense decreased by 64 million or 86 for the year ended december 31 2002 from the comparable period in 2001 primarily due to prepayments pca made in 2001 and 2002 on the term loans under its senior credit facility and the receivables credit facility 

pca’s effective tax rate was 379 for the year ended december 31 2002 and 387 for the year ended december 31 2001 the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

year ended december 31 2001 compared to year ended december 31 2000 

net sales 

net sales decreased by 1319 million or 69 for the year ended december 31 2001 from the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices reduced volume of containerboard sold to third parties and slightly lower corrugated products volume 

total corrugated products volume decreased 11 to 265 billion square feet in 2001 compared to 269 billion square feet in 2000 on a comparable shipmentperworkday basis corrugated products volume decreased 15 in 2001 from 2000 the larger percentage decrease was due to the fact that 2001 had one more workday those days not falling on a weekend or holiday than 2000 containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers decreased 160 to 428000 tons for the year ended december 31 2001 from 509000 tons in the comparable period of 2000 our total containerboard mill production in 2001 was 2125000 tons compared to 2165000 tons in 2000 

according to pulp  paper week average industry midpoint linerboard and semichemical medium prices for 42 lb linereast and 26 lb mediumeast which are representative benchmark grades were 444 and 404 respectively per ton in 2001 this compares to 468 and 446 respectively per ton in 2000 

income before interest expense and income taxes operating income 

operating income decreased by 950 million or 276 for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 2000 the decrease was the result of decreased sales prices which reduced operating income by 634 million in addition to lower volume of containerboard sold to third parties and slightly lower corrugated products volume operating income for 2000 excludes a fourth quarter gain on timberland sales of 604 million 

gross profit decreased 855 million or 170 for the year ended december 31 2001 from the year ended december 31 2000 gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 262 of sales in 2000 to 233 of sales in 2001 primarily due to the sales price decreases described above 

corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2001 increased by 01 million or 02 from the year ended december 31 2000 

selling and administrative expenses increased 55 million or 47 for the year ended december 31 2001 from the comparable period in 2000 the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and other general selling related expenses 

interest expense and income taxes 

interest expense decreased by 437 million or 371 for the year ended december 31 2001 from the comparable period in 2000 primarily due to prepayments pca made on its term loans under the senior credit facility 

pca’s effective tax rate was 387 for the year ended december 31 2001 and 398 for the year ended december 31 2000 the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 743 million or 236 to 2400 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease was primarily due to lower net income as a result of decreased sales prices of containerboard and corrugated products as well as decreased deferred income taxes and unfavorable changes in working capital the unfavorable changes in working capital were primarily driven by higher balances of accounts receivable related to the strong sales volumes previously described partially offset by lower inventory levels and a smaller reduction of the accounts payable balance than in 2001 

cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 267 million or 78 to 3143 million for the year ended december 31 2001 from the comparable period in 2000 the decrease was primarily due to lower net income and decreased deferred taxes partially offset by a favorable change in working capital caused by lower balances of accounts receivable due to lower sales prices and volumes described previously 

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities decreased by 253 million or 187 to 1096 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the change was primarily the result of decreased additions to property plant and equipment and one business acquisition in the second quarter of 2001 

cash used for investing activities increased by 2518 million or 2153 to 1349 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to the year ended december 31 2000 the change was primarily attributable to a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales of 2479 million 

as of december 31 2002 pca had commitments for capital expenditures of 313 million pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 

financing activities 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 233 million or 222 to 816 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 primarily attributable to decreased prepayments made by pca on its various debt agreements and a decrease in expenditures to repurchase pca common stock 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 3555 million or 772 for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to the year ended december 31 2000 primarily reflecting decreased prepayments made by pca on its various debt agreements 

on january 28 2000 pca became a publicly traded company with an initial public offering of its common stock on march 3 2000 pca used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of 12 3  8  senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010 

on november 16 2000 pca completed the sale of approximately 385000 acres of timberland to southern timber venture llc pca received 2479 million in cash and a 33 1  3  equity ownership interest in southern timber venture llc pca recorded a pretax gain of 604 million and a portion of the gain was not recognized as a result of pca’s continuing ownership interest in march 2002 pca received a 23 million dividend 14 million aftertax from southern timber venture llc 

on november 29 2000 pca established an onbalance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable to effectuate this program pca formed a whollyowned limited purpose subsidiary packaging credit company llc or pcc which in turn formed a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose subsidiary packaging receivables company llc or prc for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca under this program pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc prc and lenders established a 1500 million receivablesbacked revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc in the event of a liquidation of prc the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc’s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowingbase formula as a result the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times as of december 31 2002 1130 million was outstanding and 370 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2002 was 1260 million 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pca’s contractual obligations at december 31 2002 

   

  

the lease commitments purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 see notes 6 and 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pca’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under pca’s senior revolving credit facility and receivables credit facility as of december 31 2002 pca had 1870 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements pca’s primary uses of cash are for debt service and capital expenditures pca expects to be able to fund its debt service and capital expenditures from these sources 

the following table provides the outstanding balance and the weighted average interest rate as of december 31 2002 for each of pca’s outstanding term loans the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility 

 

a the term loan interest rates reflect the floor of the interest rate collar agreement that expires in june of 2003 plus the applicable spread the floor of this agreement was 495 at december 31 2002

in addition to the term loans and other borrowing arrangements noted above pca has 5500 million of 9 58 senior subordinated notes callable beginning april 1 2004 at 1048125 and due 2009 

the borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility are available to fund pca’s working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the term loan a must be repaid in quarterly installments from september 2004 through 2006 the term loan b must be repaid in quarterly installments from march 2005 through 2007 the senior revolving credit facility will terminate in 2006 the receivables credit facility will terminate on november 29 2003 

since april 12 1999 pca has made prepayments totaling approximately 10270 million using cash flow from operations of 5160 million and proceeds from the sales of timberland of 5110 million to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term loans and variable rate debt 

the instruments governing pca’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that restrict among other things the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to 

·   incur additional indebtedness

·   pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments

·   consummate certain asset sales

·   incur liens

·   enter into certain transactions with affiliates or

·   merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca

these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 

in addition we must maintain minimum debt service minimum net worth and maximum leverage ratios under the senior credit facility a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit facility 

pca estimates that it will make approximately 1150 million in capital expenditures in 2003 these expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital cost reduction business growth and environmental compliance 

pca believes that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next 12 months and that cash generated from operations and amounts available under the senior revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future pca’s future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond pca’s control 

environmental matters 

we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws in particular the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 

as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as the federal “superfund” law and analogous state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances under the terms of the contribution agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan unrelated to current mill operations 

because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material from january 1994 through december 2002 remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about 29 million as of december 31 2002 we maintained an environmental reserve of 37 million which includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule compliance were 43 million for 2002 and we currently estimate 2003 environmental capital expenditures will be 147 million of which 44 million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements 

impact of inflation 

pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

accounts receivable—allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit sources we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 03 for amounts less than 90 days past due and 30 for amounts more than 90 days past due based on our historical collection experience if our collection experience deteriorates ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 

as of december 31 2002 the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was 58 million compared to 52 million at december 31 2001 bad debt expense in 2002 was 30 million compared to 07 million in 2001 of the 23 million increase 17 million was attributable to three customers that filed for bankruptcy during 2002  for the year ended december 31 2001 bad debt expense was 07 million compared to 58 million in 2000 during 2000 28 million of bad debt expense was attributable to six customers that filed for bankruptcy during the year 

inventory 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required raw materials work in process and finished goods are valued using the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market method supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 

derivatives 

we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements we do not speculate in derivatives trading hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting if hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 

to hedge interest rate risk interest rate collars are used to protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee minimum interest rates related to our variable rate debt these instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and cash payments the cash receipts and cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change information about the fair values notional amounts and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in notes 6 and 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements and the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included elsewhere in this report 

in addition to the above derivative financial instruments we have other contracts covering a portion of our purchases of natural gas and electricity that have the characteristics of derivatives but are not required to be accounted for as derivatives these contracts for the physical delivery of these items qualify for the normal purchases exception under sfas no 133 as we take physical delivery of the item and use it in the production process this exception is an election and if not elected these contracts would be carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income these contracts cover natural gas and electricity usage at our mills through 2004 at december 31 2002 estimated future payments under these contracts amounted to 197 million 

environmental liabilities 

the estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance costs expected to be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing operating landfill areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to date amounts are estimates using current technologies for closure and monitoring and are not discounted 

the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however our estimates may change we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april 12 1999 pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation were required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value were required 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets”

 item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes 

pca has interest rate collar agreements that protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee a minimum interest rate the notional amount of these collar agreements was 788 million and 1750 million as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the weighted average floor of the interest rate collar agreements was 495 and 502 as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the weighted average ceiling of the interest rate collar agreements was 675 and 685 as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the interest rate on approximately 41 and 71 of pca’s variablerate debt as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively was capped pca receives payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate libor or commercial paper exceeds the ceiling correspondingly pca makes payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate drops below the floor in both cases the amounts received or paid are based upon the notional amount and the difference between the actual interest rate and the ceiling or floor rate at december 31 2002 the commercial paper based interest rate collar agreement expired the remaining interest rate collar agreement with a floor of 495 expires june 30 2003 

as a result of the collar agreements noted above and the interest rate environment a one percent increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately 11 million and 07 million annually for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the weighted average libor was 140 and 191 respectively and the weighted average commercial paper rate was 140 and 192 respectively the effect of an interest rate change to the fair market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant this analysis does not consider any other impact on fair market value that could exist in such an interest rate environment in the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca’s financial structure

consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants and shipped about
265 billion square feet of corrugated products

    in 2000 we produced over 13 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills
located in counce tennessee and valdosta georgia we also produced more than
800000 tons of semichemical corrugating medium at our mills located in
tomahawk wisconsin and filer city michigan we currently lease the cutting
rights to approximately 140000 acres of timberland located near our counce and
valdosta mills we also have supply agreements on about 600000 of the 800000
acres of timberland we sold during 1999 and 2000

    our converting operations produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging
products including conventional shipping containers used to protect and
transport manufactured goods we also produce multicolor boxes and displays
with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in
retail locations finally we are a large producer of meat boxes and waxcoated
boxes for the agricultural industry

corporate developments

    on april 12 1999 pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco
packaging inc a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc sold its
containerboard and corrugated products business to pca an entity formed by
madison dearborn partners llc a private equity investment firm in
january 1999 for 22 billion consisting of 2465 million in cash the
assumption of 176 billion of debt incurred by pactiv immediately prior to the
contribution and a 45 common equity interest in pca valued at 1935 million
pca holdings llc an entity organized and controlled by madison dearborn
acquired the remaining 55 common equity interest in pca for 2365 million in
cash which was used to finance in part the transactions

    the financing of the transactions consisted of 1 borrowings under a new
14690 million senior credit facility for which jp morgan securities inc
and bt alex brown incorporated the predecessor to deutsche banc alex brown
were colead arrangers 2 the offering of 5500 million of 9 58 senior
subordinated notes due 2009 and 1000 million of 12 38 senior exchangeable
preferred stock due 2010 3 a cash equity investment of 2365 million by pca
holdings and 4 an equity investment by pactiv valued at 1935 million as
required by their terms the 5500 million of senior subordinated notes and
1000 million of senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the april 12
1999 transactions were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same

original aggregate principal amount of 12190 million and a revolving credit
facility with up to 2500 million in availability effective december 14 1999
pca elected to reduce its availability under the revolving credit facility from

industry overview

    according to the fibre box association the value of industry shipments of
corrugated products was over 24 billion in 2000

    the primary enduse markets for corrugated products are shown below


                                                           
food beverages and agricultural products  413
paper and fiber products  209
petroleum plastic synthetic and rubber products   91
glass pottery fabricated metal and metal containers   59
electrical and electronic machinery and appliances   38


    corrugated products are generally delivered by truck compared to many other
products the amount of corrugated products that can fit into a truckload weighs
much less this coupled with the relatively low price per ton of corrugated
products make shipping costs account for a relatively high portion of total
costs as a result converting plants tend to be located in close proximity to
customers to minimize freight costs the corrugated products industry consists
of an estimated 683 companies in the united states

    containerboard which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium is
the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products linerboard
is used as the inner and outer facings or liners of corrugated products
corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to
produce corrugated sheets the sheets are subsequently printed cut folded and
glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products

    containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers
as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting
operations kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine
semichemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak wood may be
brought to the mill as logs to be chipped or as alreadychipped wood the chips
are chemically treated and cooked to form virgin fiber also known as wood pulp
this pulp can be processed alone or blended with some percentage of recycled
fiber on paper machines the pulp is mixed with water and flows onto a moving
wire screen which allows the water to drain and concentrates the fibers what
remains is a paper mat that is compressed by a series of presses and then dried
the paper is wound into large rolls which are slit to size as required by
converters and shipped to them

    linerboard is made in a range of grades or basis weights the most common
basis weight for linerboard is 42 lb although linerboard is produced in
weights that vary from under 26 lb to over 90 lb basis weight represents the
weight in pounds per thousand square feet of linerboard producers

    historically pricing for containerboard has reflected changes in
containerboard supply that resulted from major capacity additions as well as
changes in demand

pca operations and products

    our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades
ranging from 26 lb to 96 lb our two semichemical corrugating medium mills can
manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb to 47 lb all four of our mills
have completed an extensive independent review process to become iso 9002
certified iso 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a
facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing sales and
customer service

367000 tons a year if we run all three paper machines filer city produces a
range of corrugating medium grades in basis weights from 21 lb to 40 lb

    we operate 65 corrugated products plants a supply services group a
technical and development center and five graphic design centers of the
65 corrugated products plants 38 have a corrugator on site and manufacture both
combined sheets and finished products the remaining 27 corrugated products
plants purchase combined sheets and create finished products two other small
specialty facilities include a collating and distribution packaging center as
well as a machine rebuild facility the five graphic design centers are located
in westmont illinois cincinnati ohio dallas texas north brunswick new
jersey and southgate california

    these graphic design centers were established in response to customers
increasing need for sophisticated high impact graphics on their corrugated
products customers are increasingly using special instore corrugated displays
to market their products and are requiring more intricate packaging designs our
graphic design centers offer stateoftheart computers and equipment that are
capable of 24hour design turnaround and reduced product delivery times

    our converting operations are spread throughout the united states each
corrugator plant serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles our
sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugator
plants which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities
such as small volume and quick turnaround items

    we produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping
containers to specialized packaging such as waxcoated boxes for the agriculture
industry we also have multicolor printing capabilities to make highimpact
graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging

    timberland

    we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 140000 acres of
timberland located near our counce and valdosta mills all of the acres under
cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of our mills which
results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood
fiber virtually all of these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with
over 20 years remaining

    during 1999 and 2000 pca sold about 800000 acres of timberland as part of
the timberland sale agreements we entered into supply arrangements covering
about 600000 acres of the total acres sold we also retained a onethird equity
ownership interest in 385000 acres sold to southern timber venture llc in
november 2000

    in addition to the timberland we manage ourselves our forest management
assistance program provides professional forestry assistance to private
timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest
schedule we have managed the regeneration of approximately 100000 acres by
supplying pine seedlings in exchange for our expertise we are given the right
of first refusal over timber sales from those lands these private lands include
over 200000 acres of timberland we expect to harvest over 150000 cords of
wood from these forests annually

    pca also participates in the sustainable forestry initiative which is
organized by the american forest and paper association this initiative is aimed
at ensuring the longterm health and conservation of americas forestry
resources activities include limiting tree harvest sizes replanting harvest
acreage participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams

    solid wood and recycling facilities

    we own three sawmills located in ackerman and fulton mississippi and
selmer tennessee during 2000 these three sawmills sold approximately
1500 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and building products
we also have an airdry yard operation in burnsville mississippi that holds
newly cut lumber while it dries finally we have a 50 interest in a wood
chipping joint venture in fulton mississippi

    we also operate three paper recycling centers one in jackson tennessee and
two in nashville tennessee these recycling centers collect old corrugated
containers newspapers and other paper that provide a source of recycled fiber
to our nearby counce mill

sales and marketing

    our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing
organization sales representatives and a sales manager at each converting
operations facility serve local and regional accounts corporate account
managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations
additionally our graphic design centers maintain an onsite dedicated graphics
sales force general marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters

    our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and
corrugating medium to our own corrugator plants to other domestic customers and
to the export market this group handles order processing for all shipments of
containerboard from our own mills to our own corrugator plants these personnel
also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other
containerboard manufacturers

    in addition to direct sales and marketing personnel we utilize support
personnel that are new product development engineers and product graphics and
design specialists these individuals are located at both the corrugator plants
as well as the graphic design centers

distribution

    our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large
number of customers and their demand for timely service shipping costs
represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk
of corrugated products as a result our converting operations typically service
customers within a 150 miles radius

    containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck our
individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities we do
use some thirdparty warehouses for shortterm storage

customers

    about 75 of our corrugated products customers are regional and local
accounts which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic
locations the remaining 25 of our customer base consists primarily of national
accounts or those customers with a national presence these customers typically
purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the
united states

    our 65 corrugated products plants consume approximately 80 of our mills
containerboard production of the remaining 20 of our containerboard production
that we do not consume at our own converting operations about 14 is sold to
domestic customers and about 6 is sold to export customers

major raw materials used

    fiber supply  fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of
containerboard to reduce our fiber costs we have invested in processes and
equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility our mills have the
capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood
hardwood and recycled sources with the exception of our valdosta mill our
other mills can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production
our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the
impact of changes in the prices of various fibers

    energy supply  energy at the mills is obtained through purchased
electricity or through various fuels which are then converted to steam or
electricity onsite fuel sources include coal natural gas oil bark and
byproducts of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process these fuels
are burned in boilers to produce steam steam turbine generators are used to
produce electricity

    our two kraft linerboard mills at counce and valdosta generate approximately
65 to 70 of their energy requirements from their own byproducts presently
an average of 50 of our electricity consumption for the four mills is generated
onsite

competition

    corrugated products are produced by nearly 700 us companies operating
approximately 1500 plants most corrugated products are custom manufactured to
the customers specifications corrugated producers generally sell within a
150mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in
their local market in fact the fibre box association tracks industry data by
47 distinct market regions

    the larger multiplant integrated companies may also solicit larger
multiplant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated
basis these customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts

    corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through
pricing quality service design and product innovation we compete for both
local and national account business and we compete against producers of other
types of packaging products on a national level our competitors include four m
corporation gaylord container corporation georgiapacific corporation
international paper company smurfitstone container corporation
templeinland inc weyerhaeuser company and willamette industries inc
however with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts we believe we
compete as much with the smaller independent converters as with the larger
integrated producers

    the competition relative to pcas containerboard produced but not consumed
at our own corrugated products plants are a number of large diversified paper
companies including georgiapacific corporation international paper company
smurfitstone container corporation templeinland inc weyerhaeuser company
and willamette industries inc as well as other regional manufacturers
containerboard is generally considered a commoditytype product and can be
purchased from numerous suppliers

employees

    as of december 31 2000 we had approximately 7900 employees approximately
2100 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5800 were hourly
approximately 75 of our hourly employees are represented by unions our
unionized employees are represented primarily by the paper allied industrial

june 2001 and november 2006 we are currently in negotiations to renew or extend
any union contracts expiring in the near future

    there have been no instances of significant work stoppages in the past
15 years we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees

environmental matters

    compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our
business operations we commit substantial resources to maintaining
environmental compliance and managing environmental risk we are subject to and
must comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws
particularly those relating to air and water quality waste disposal and the
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater we believe that we are currently
in material compliance with all applicable environmental rules and regulations
because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and
will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws we work
diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental
regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance
obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition

    in april 1998 the united states environmental protection agency epa
finalized a new clean air and water act commonly referred to as the cluster
rules which govern all pulp and paper mill operations including those at our
mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable
discharges of air and water pollutants as a result pca and its competitors are
required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules from 1997
through 2000 we spent approximately 282 million on cluster rule compliance to
meet 2001 clean air act requirements total capital costs for environmental
matters including cluster rule compliance were 240 million for 2000 and we
currently estimate that they will be 81 million for 2001 of which
21 million is for 2002 to 2005 cluster rule requirements our current spending
projections to complete cluster rule compliance implementation at our four mills
is about 257 million from 2001 to 2005

    as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred
costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination from
january 1994 through december 2000 remediation costs at our mills and
converting plants totaled about 26 million we do not believe that any
ongoing remedial projects are material in nature as of december 31 2000 we
maintained a reserve of 03 million for environmental remediation liability as
well as a general overall environmental reserve of 26 million which includes
funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing
and anticipated remedial projects we believe these reserves are adequate

    we could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third
parties for civil damages including liability for personal injury or property
damage arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination we are
not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us

    in the transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal
pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near
the filer city mill

   we have operated only two of our three paper machines at filer city since
    july 1998 reducing the total productive capacity by 70000 tons to
    297000 tons

    each of the mills is currently subject to a mortgage held by morgan guaranty

pca has no owned or leased properties outside of the continental united states
all of our owned real property is subject to a first priority mortgage held by
morgan guaranty trust company of new york on behalf of the lenders under the

rights agreements have terms with over 20 years remaining

    we currently lease our executive and administrative offices in lake forest
illinois from pactiv under a lease expiring in january 2003 we currently
believe that our facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating
requirements for the foreseeable future



item 3  legal proceedings

    on may 14 1999 we were named as a defendant in a consolidated
class action complaint which alleged a civil violation of section 1 of the
sherman act the suit captioned winoff industries inc v stone container
corporation mdl no 1261 ed pa names us as a defendant based solely on
the allegation that we are a successor to the interests of tenneco packaging
inc and tenneco inc both of which were also named as defendants in the suit
along with nine other linerboard manufacturers the complaint alleges that the
defendants during the period october 1 1993 through november 30 1995
conspired to limit the supply of linerboard and that the purpose and effect of
the alleged conspiracy was artificially to increase prices of corrugated
containers the plaintiffs have moved to certify a class of all persons in the
united states who purchased corrugated containers directly from any defendant
during the above period and seek treble damages and attorneys fees on behalf
of the purported class the court has yet to rule on the plaintiffs motion for
class certification and the case is currently set for trial in june 2002 we
believe that the plaintiffs allegations have no merit and intend to defend
against the suit vigorously we do not believe that the outcome of this
litigation should have a material adverse effect on our financial position
results of operations or cash flow

    we are also party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
our business these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our
entire business we believe that the resolution of these legal actions will not
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations

condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report

overview

    in connection with the transactions pca acquired the containerboard group
of pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc a wholly owned
subsidiary of tenneco inc which consisted of its containerboard and corrugated
products business and which we refer to in this report as the group from its
formation in january 1999 and through the closing of the acquisition on
april 12 1999 pca did not have any significant operations accordingly the
historical financial results for periods prior to april 12 1999 described below
are those of the group

    the group operated prior to april 12 1999 as a division of pactiv and not
as a separate standalone entity as a result the historical financial
information included in this report does not necessarily reflect what the
groups financial position and results of operations would have been had the
group been operated as a separate standalone entity during the periods prior
to april 12 1999

    the acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the
contributed assets purchase accounting was not applied because under the
applicable accounting guidance a change of control was deemed not to have
occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the
closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement
entered into in connection with the transactions

general

    historically prices for containerboard have reflected changes in
containerboard supply that result from capacity additions and reductions as
well as changes in demand containerboard demand is dependent upon both domestic
demand for corrugated products and linerboard export activity

    according to pulp  paper week after giving effect to price increases in
2000 average prices in december 2000 for linerboard and corrugating medium were
12 and 11 higher respectively than december 1999 prices

    pulp  paper week in its january 22 2001 publication reported that prices
for linerboard and corrugating medium decreased 15 per ton or 3 and 20 per
ton or 4 respectively compared to december 2000 levels the march 19 2001
pulp  paper week publication reported that prices remained unchanged from
january 2001 levels

net sales

    net sales increased by 1513 million or 85 for the year ended
december 31 2000 from the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 the increase
was primarily the result of increased sales prices of corrugated products and
containerboard to third parties

    corrugated products volume was essentially flat in 2000 compared to record
volume in 1999 of 266 billion square feet containerboard volume to external
domestic and export customers increased

income before interest expense and income taxes operating income

    operating income increased by 1384 million or 672 for the year ended
december 31 2000 compared to pro forma 1999 the increase was the result of
increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard to third
parties and reduced corporate overhead expenses operating income results for
both years exclude fourth quarter gains on timberland sales of 604 million and
122 million for 2000 and 1999 respectively

    gross profit increased 1401 million or 390 for the year ended
december 31 2000 from the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 gross profit
as a percentage of sales improved from 203 of sales in 1999 to 260 of sales
in the current year primarily due to the sales price increases described above

    corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 2000 decreased by
25 million or 58 from the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 the
reduction primarily reflects the difference in cost between the overhead charged
to the group by tenneco and pactiv and overhead expenses incurred by pca as a
standalone entity corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 included three and onehalf months of corporate overhead
through april 11 1999 charged by tenneco and pactiv and eight and onehalf
months of corporate overhead expenses incurred by pca as a standalone entity

    selling and administrative expenses increased 46 million or 42 for the
year ended december 31 2000 from the comparable period in 1999 the increase
was primarily the result of increased salary and other general selling related
expenses

interest expense and income taxes

    interest expense decreased by 340 million or 224 for the year ended
december 31 2000 from the comparable pro forma period in 1999 primarily due to
voluntary prepayments pca made on its term loans under the senior credit
facility

    pcas effective tax rate was 398 for the year ended december 31 2000 and
455 for the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 the tax rate is higher
than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes

pro forma year ended december 31 1999 compared to year ended december 31 1998

net sales

    net sales increased by 1267 million or 77 for the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 from the comparable period in 1998 the increase was the
result of increased sales volume of both corrugated products and containerboard
and the increased sales prices of corrugated products and outside sales of
containerboard

    corrugated products volume increased by 64 to 266 billion square feet in
1999 from 250 billion square feet in 1998 containerboard volume to external
domestic and export customers increased 85 to 572000 tons in 1999 from

income before interest expense and income taxes operating income

    operating income increased by 871 million or 732 for the pro forma year
ended december 31 1999 compared to 1998 this increase excludes a
122 million gain on a 1999 fourth quarter timberlands sale and for the
comparable period in 1998 a 169 million gain on the sale of nonstrategic
woodlands a 151 million gain on the sale of a 20 interest in a recycled
paperboard joint venture a 144 million restructuring charge and a
148 million charge for factored receivables financing the increase was the
result of increased sales volume of both corrugated products and containerboard
the increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard to third
parties and reduced corporate overhead expenses

    gross profit increased 780 million or 277 for the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 from the comparable period in 1998 gross profit as a
percentage of sales improved from 171 of sales in 1998 to 203 of sales in
1999 primarily due to the sales price and volume increases described above

    corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 decreased
by 205 million or 324 from the comparable period in 1998 the reduction
primarily reflects the difference in cost between the overhead charged to the
group by tenneco and pactiv and overhead expenses incurred by pca as a
standalone entity corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 included three and onehalf months of corporate overhead
through april 11 1999 charged by tenneco and pactiv and eight and onehalf
months of corporate overhead expenses incurred by pca as a standalone entity
corporate overhead for the comparable period in 1998 consisted exclusively of
corporate overhead charged by tenneco and pactiv

    selling and administrative expenses increased 09 million or 08 for the
pro forma year ended december 31 1999 from the comparable period in 1998 the
increase was primarily the result of year 2000 remediation expenses y2k

interest expense and income taxes

    interest expense increased by 1489 million or 53533 for the pro forma
year ended december 31 1999 from the comparable period in 1998 primarily due
to borrowings under the senior credit facility and the issuance of
5500 million of the senior subordinated notes this indebtedness was incurred
to finance the transactions

    pcas effective tax rate was 455 for the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 and 400 for the comparable period in 1998 the tax rate is
higher than the federal statutory rate of 350 due to state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources

prior to the transactions

    as a division of pactiv the group did not maintain separate cash accounts
other than for petty cash the groups disbursements for payroll capital
projects operating supplies and expenses were processed and funded by pactiv
through centrally managed accounts in addition cash receipts from the
collection of accounts receivable and the sales of assets were remitted directly
to bank accounts controlled by pactiv

                                       16
page
    because of pactivs centrally managed cash system in which the cash
receipts and disbursements of pactivs various divisions were commingled it was
not feasible to segregate cash received from pactiv such as financing for the
business from cash transmitted to pactiv such as a distribution accordingly
the net effect of these cash transactions with pactiv is represented as a single
line item within the financing section of the statement of cash flows
similarly the activity of the interdivision account presents the net transfer
of funds and charges between pactiv and the group as a single line item

    since april 12 1999 pca has maintained its own cash accounts

operating activities

    cash flow provided by operating activities increased 1278 million or
605 for the year ended december 31 2000 from the comparable pro forma period
in 1999 the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income

    cash flow provided by operating activities increased by 158 million or
81 from 1998 to 1999 the increase was primarily due to the replacement of
leased assets with owned depreciable assets in connection with the april 12
1999 transactions

investing activities

    cash used for investing activities increased by 315 million or 209 for
the year ended december 31 2000 compared to the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 the increase was primarily attributable to increased capital
expenditures and a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales

    net cash used for investing activities decreased 3281 million or 1846
for the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 from the comparable period in
1998 primarily attributable to a prepaid lease payment made in december 1998 to
acquire timberland as part of a lease buyout and timberlands sale proceeds
received in the fourth quarter of 1999

    as of december 31 2000 pca had commitments for capital expenditures of
379 million pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will
be sufficient to fund these commitments

financing activities

    cash used for financing activities increased by 294 million or 68 for
the year ended december 31 2000 compared to the pro forma year ended
december 31 1999 primarily reflecting increased voluntary prepayments made by
pca on its term loans under the senior credit facility

    cash used for financing activities increased 4133 million or 23390
for the pro forma year ended december 31 1999 from the comparable period in
1998 the increase was primarily attributable to the voluntary prepayments pca
has made on its term loans under the senior credit facility

after the transactions

    following the transactions pcas primary sources of liquidity are cash flow
from operations and borrowings under pcas new revolving credit facility pcas
primary uses of cash are for debt service and capital expenditures pca expects
to be able to fund its debt service and capital expenditures from these sources

    pca incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the transactions
on april 12 1999 pca had approximately 17690 million of indebtedness
outstanding which included 12190 million of senior secured bank debt
5500 million of 9 58 subordinated notes and 1000 million of 12 38
preferred stock

                                       17

    concurrently with the transactions pca issued the notes and preferred stock
and entered into the senior credit facility the senior credit facility
initially provided for three term loans in an aggregate amount of
12190 million and a revolving credit facility with up to 2500 million in
availability upon the closing of the acquisition pca borrowed the full amount
available under the term loans and 90 million under the senior revolving
credit facility the latter of which was repaid immediately thereafter

    in october and november 1999 pca completed the sales of approximately
405000 acres of timberland total proceeds received from the sales were
2633 million resulting in a pretax gain of 122 million

    effective december 14 1999 pca elected to reduce its availability under
the revolving credit facility from 2500 million to 1500 million on
june 29 2000 pca completed the refinancing of its 8850 million senior credit
facility

    on january 28 2000 pca became a publicly traded company with an initial
public offering of its common stock on march 3 2000 pca used the net proceeds
from the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of 12 38 senior
exchangeable preferred stock due 2010

    on november 16 2000 pca completed the sale of approximately 385000 acres
of timberland to southern timber venture llc the company received
2479 million in cash and a 33 13 equity ownership interest in southern
timber venture llc pca recorded a pretax gain of 604 million and a portion
of the gain was not recognized as a result of pcas continuing ownership
interest

    the borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility are available to
fund pcas working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes the term loan a must be repaid in quarterly installments
from december 2002 through 2006 the term loan b must be repaid in quarterly
installments from december 2002 through 2007 the senior revolving credit
facility will terminate in 2006 the threeyear revolving credit facility will
terminate in 2003

    in 1999 and 2000 pca made voluntary prepayments totaling approximately
4400 million and 4600 million respectively using free cash flow from
operations of 3890 million and proceeds from the sales of timberland of
5110 million to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term loans

    the instruments governing pcas indebtedness and the preferred stock contain
financial and other covenants that restrict among other things the ability of
pca and its subsidiaries to

     incur additional indebtedness

     pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments

     consummate certain asset sales

     incur liens

     merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of
      all or substantially all of the assets of pca

    these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities

    pca estimates that it will make approximately 1350 million in capital
expenditures in 2001 these expenditures will be used primarily for cost
reduction business growth and environmental compliance

    pca believes that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet
its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working
capital needs for the next 12 months and that cash generated from operations
and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to
meet its anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working
capital needs for the foreseeable future pcas future operating performance and
its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service extend or
refinance the senior credit facility will be subject to future economic
conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are
beyond pcas control

environmental matters

    we are subject to and must comply with a variety of federal state and
local environmental laws particularly those relating to air and water quality
waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater because
environmental regulations are constantly evolving we have incurred and will
continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws in particular
the epa recently finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill
operations including those at the counce filer city valdosta and tomahawk
mills over the next several years the cluster rules will affect our allowable
discharges of air and water pollutants and require us to spend money to ensure
compliance with those new rules

    as is the case with any industrial operation we have in the past incurred
costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination as
required by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act commonly known as the federal superfund law and analogous
state laws cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently
own or operate former facilities and offsite facilities where we have disposed
of hazardous substances because liability under these laws is strict meaning
that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that
liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and
retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future
and this liability could be material under the terms of the contribution
agreement pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities
and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal pactiv has
also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city michigan
unrelated to current mill operations

    because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict
meaning that liability is imposed without fault joint and several meaning that
liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution and
retroactive we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future
and this liability could be material from january 1994 through december 2000
remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about
26 million as of december 31 2000 we maintained a reserve of 03 million
for environmental remediation liability as well as a general overall
environmental reserve of 26 million which includes funds relating to onsite
landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial
projects total capital costs for environmental matters including cluster rule
compliance were 240 million for 2000 and we currently estimate that they will
be 81 million for 2001 of which 21 million is for 2002 to 2005 cluster rule
requirements

impact of inflation

    pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations during the past three years

new accounting standards

    for a description of changes in accounting principles affecting pca see
note 2 to pcas audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this report



item 7a  quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk

    historically pca has not had any material market risk due to the fact that
its debt financing and risk management activities were conducted by pactiv or
tenneco as a result of the transactions pca is exposed to the impact of
interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial
instruments pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these
risks but not for trading purposes

    under the terms of the senior credit agreement dated as of april 12 1999
pca was required to maintain for at least two years after the closing of the
transactions interest rate protection agreements establishing a fixed maximum
interest rate with respect to at least 50 of the outstanding term loans under
the senior credit agreement upon the refinancing of the senior credit agreement
on june 29 2000 this requirement was deleted

    pca currently has interest rate collar agreements that protect against
rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee a minimum interest rate the
original notional amount of these collar agreements was 7200 million as pca
has made debt prepayments the need for these collar agreements has diminished
accordingly pca has reduced the notional amount of the collars to
2500 million as of december 31 2000 the weighted average floor of the
interest rate collar agreements is 500 and the weighted average ceiling of the
interest rate collar agreements is 683 the interest rate on approximately 78
of pcas variablerate debt at december 31 2000 is capped pca receives
payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate libor or
commercial paper exceeds the ceiling correspondingly pca makes payments under
the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate drops below the floor in
both cases the amounts received or paid are based upon the notional amount and
the difference between the actual interest rate and the ceiling or floor rate
the weighted average duration of the interest rate collar agreements is
approximately two and one quarter years

    pcas earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a
result of borrowings under its variablerate debt instruments if interest rates
libor or commercial paper for these borrowings increase one percent pcas
interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would decrease
by approximately 32 million and 78 million annually as of december 31 2000
and 1999 respectively until the applicable interest rate exceeds the ceiling
rate at that point only 22 and 35 of the variablerate debt as of
december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively would result in additional interest
expense as of december 31 2000 the weighted average libor rate was 673 and
the weighted average commercial paper rate was 660 as of december 31 1999
the interest rate on the term loans was based on a weighted average libor rate
of 595 the effect of an interest rate change to the fair market value of the
outstanding debt is insignificant this analysis does not consider any other
impact on fair value that could exist in such an interest rate environment in
the event of a change in interest rates management could take actions to
further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of
the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the
sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pcas financial structure

    pca also capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development
of software which is used in its business operations the costs attributable to
these software systems are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on
various factors such as the effects of obsolescence technology and other
economic factors

impairment of longlived assets

    longlived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation
of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be
compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to
discounted cash flows is required

financial instruments

    the company uses interest rate collar agreements to manage interest costs
and the risk associated with changing interest rates as interest rates change
the differential paid or received is recognized in interest expense of the
period

income taxes

    pca utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby it
recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts in the financial statements deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when based upon managements estimates it is
more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized in a future period the estimates utilized in the recognition of
deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts
or circumstances

environmental liabilities

    the estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance costs expected to
be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing operating landfill
areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to date amounts are
estimates using current technologies for closure and monitoring and are not
discounted

    the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to
such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs the complexity
and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their
interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
cleanup technologies liabilities recorded by the company for environmental
contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available
information and assumptions because of these uncertainties however pcas
estimates may change pca believes that any additional costs identified as
further information becomes available would not have a material effect on its
financial statements

    in the transactions pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
facilities and all sites associated with preclosing offsite waste disposal
pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near

    the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable in addition option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility
because the companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in managements
opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options

    as permitted by sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation the
company has elected to account for its stock option plan under accounting
principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to
employees and adopt the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 123 under apb
no 25 no compensation costs are recognized because the number of options is
fixed and the option exercise price is equal to the fair market price of the
common stock on the date of the grant under sfas no 123 stock options are
valued at the grant date using the blackscholes valuation model and
compensation costs are recognized ratably over the vesting period had
compensation costs been determined as prescribed by sfas no 123 the companys

significant intragroup accounts and transactions have been eliminated

    revenue recognition

    the group recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers

    accounts receivable

    historically a substantial portion of the groups trade accounts receivable
were sold by packaging generally without recourse to a financing subsidiary of
tenneco inc expenses relating to cash discounts credit losses pricing
adjustments and other allowances on these factored receivables are accrued and
charged to the group as part of the containerboard transaction these
receivables were purchased by packaging from the financing subsidiary and
contributed to pca all purchase and sale transactions were consummated at fair
value which was the same as the net book value of the receivables as reflected
on the groups financial statements prior to the initial sale therefore due to
the pending sale transaction the amount of trade accounts receivable sold was
0 at april 11 1999

    inventories

    raw materials and finished goods are valued using the lastin firstout
lifo cost method and include material labor and manufacturingrelated
overhead costs supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving
average cost all inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market

    property plant and equipment

    timber depletion is provided on the basis of timber cut during the period
related to the estimated quantity of recoverable timber assets under capital
leases are depreciated on the straightline method over the term of the lease

    expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred

    longlived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation
of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be
compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to
discounted cash flows is required

    changes in accounting principles

    in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities this statement establishes new accounting
and reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value the
statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires
that a company must formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that receive hedge accounting this statement is effective for all
fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 the adoption of this new standard is
not expected to have a significant effect on the groups financial position or
results of operations

    in april 1998 the american institute of certified public accountants
aicpa issued statement of position sop 985 reporting on the costs of
startup activities which requires costs of startup activities to be expensed
as incurred this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
december 15 1998 the statement requires capitalized costs related to startup
activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle when the statement is adopted tenneco adopted this new accounting
principle in the first quarter of 1999 the adoption of this new standard did
not have a significant effect on the groups financial position or results of
operations

    in march 1998 the aicpa issued sop 981 accounting for the costs of
computer software developed or obtained for internal use which establishes new
accounting and reporting standards for the costs of computer software developed
or obtained for internal use this statement will be applied prospectively and
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 1998 the adoption of
this new standard did not have a significant effect on the groups financial
position or results of operations

2 summary of accounting policies continued
    freight trades

    the group regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers primarily
to reduce shipping costs the freight trade transactions are accounted for
primarily as transactions in the inventory accounts the impact on income is not
material

    environmental liabilities

    the estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance costs expected to
be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing operating landfill
areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to date amounts are
estimates using current technologies for closure and monitoring and are not
discounted

    the potential costs related to the group for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded by the group for
environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon
available information and assumptions relating to the group because of these
uncertainties however the groups estimates may change the group believes
that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available
would not have a material effect on the combined statements of assets
liabilities and interdivision account or revenues expenses and interdivision
account of the group

    combined statements of cash flows

    as a division of packaging the group does not maintain separate cash
accounts other than for petty cash the groups disbursements for payroll
capital projects operating supplies and expenses are processed and funded by
packaging through centrally managed accounts in addition cash receipts from
the collection of accounts receivable and the sales of assets are remitted
directly to bank accounts controlled by packaging in this type of centrally
managed cash system in which the cash receipts and disbursements of packagings
various divisions are commingled it is not feasible to segregate cash received
from packaging eg as financing for the business from cash transmitted to
packaging eg as a distribution accordingly the net effect of these cash
transactions with packaging are presented as a single line item within the
financing section of the cash flow statements similarly the activity of the
interdivision account presents the net transfer of funds and charges between
packaging and the group as a single line item

    research and development

    research and development costs are expensed as incurred the amounts charged
were 1015000 from january 1 1999 through april 11 1999

    intangible assets

    the group has capitalized certain intangible assets primarily trademarks
and patents based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition
amortization is provided for these intangible assets

on a straightline basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years covenants not
to compete are amortized on a straightline basis over the terms of the
respective agreements such amortization amounted to 890000 as of april 11
1999

    intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of any intangible assets may be impaired an evaluation
of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows through the remaining amortization
period associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying
amount to determine if a writedown to discounted cash flows is required

    use of estimates

    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

    segment information

    the group adopted sfas no 131 disclosure about segments of an enterprise
and related information in 1998 and determined that the group is primarily
engaged in one line of business the manufacture and sale of packaging
materials boxes and containers for industrial and consumer markets no single
customer accounts for more than 10 of total revenues the group has no foreign
operations

    earnings per share unaudited

    earnings per share has been calculated using the historical earnings of the
group and the number of shares resulting from the april 12 1999 transaction
430000 common shares as adjusted to reflect the anticipated 220forone
stock split for the period presented basic and diluted earnings per share are
the same because there are not potentially dilutive securities

3 investment in joint venture

    the group has a 50 us joint venture with american cellulose corporation
to manufacture and market hardwood chips the net investment which was
accounted for under the equity method was 1388000 as of april 11 1999

for 1998

    middle management employees participate in a variety of incentive
compensation plans these plans provide for incentive payments based on the
achievement of certain targeted operating results and other specific business
goals the targeted operating results are determined each year by senior
management of packaging the amounts charged to expense for these plans were
1599000 for the period ended april 11 1999

    in june 1992 tenneco initiated an employee stock purchase plan espp
the plan allows us and canadian employees of the group to purchase
tenneco inc common stock through payroll deductions at a 15 discount each
year an employee in the plan may purchase shares with a discounted value not to
exceed 21250 the weighted average fair value of the employee purchase right
which was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model and the
assumptions described below except that the average life of each purchase right
was assumed to be 90 days was 631 for the period ended december 31 1998 the
espp was terminated as of september 30 1996 tenneco adopted a new employee
stock purchase plan effective april 1 1997 under the respective espps tenneco
sold 36883 shares to group employees for the period ended april 11 1999

    in december 1996 tenneco adopted the 1996 stock ownership plan which
permits the granting of a variety of awards including common stock restricted
stock performance units stock appreciation rights and stock options to
officers and employees of tenneco tenneco can issue up to 17000000 shares of
common stock under this plan which will terminate december 31 2001

    the april 11 1999 fair market value of the options granted was calculated
using tennecos stock price at the grant date and multiplying the amount by the
historical percentage of past blackscholes pricing values fair value
approximately 25 the fair value of each stock option issued by tenneco to
the group in prior periods was estimated on the date of grant using the
blacksholes option pricing model using the following ranges of weighted average
assumptions for grants during the past three

accounting for stockbased compensation based on the fair value at the grant
dates for the awards under those plans the groups pro forma net income for the
year ended april 11 1999 would have been lower by 734000

6 postretirement and postemployment benefits

    in addition to providing pension benefits the group provides certain health
care and life insurance benefits for certain retired and terminated employees a
substantial number of the groups employees may become eligible for such
benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the group the
cost of these benefits for salaried employees is allocated to the group by
packaging through a payroll charge and the interdivision account amounts
allocated are principally determined based on payroll the net obligation for
these salaried benefits is maintained by packaging and is not included in the
liabilities section of the accompanying combined statements of assets
liabilities and interdivision account for the groups share of the obligation

    currently the groups postretirement benefit plans are not funded and a
portion of the related postretirement obligation has been allocated to the
group however due to the fact that other divisions participate in the plan
certain of the disclosures required by sfas no 132 such as a summary of the
change in benefit obligation are not available actuarial information as of
april 11 1999 is not available and in connection with the sale of the group as
described in note 1 to these financial statements the longterm portion of the
postretirement liability will not be assumed by pca but will remain with
tenneco as such the actuarial information below is reported as of

    the amounts expensed by the group may be different because it was allocated
by packaging

    the weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining
the 1998 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 5

    increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
september 30 1998 by approximately 1268000 and would increase the net
postretirement benefit cost for 1998 by approximately 130000

    the discount rate which is based on longterm market rates used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7 for 1998

10 income taxes

    the groups method of accounting for income taxes requires that a deferred
tax be recorded to reflect the tax expense benefit resulting from the
recognition of temporary differences temporary differences are differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the financial statements that will result in differences between income for tax
purposes and income for financial statement purposes in future years

    as a division this group is not a taxable entity for purposes of these
combined financial statements income taxes have been allocated to the group and
represent liabilities to packaging

    following is an analysis of the components of combined income tax benefit
through april 11 1999 in thousands

processing of accounts payable and payroll requirements

    corporate allocations

    packaging and tenneco provide various services to the group including
legal human resources data processing systems support training finance and
treasury public relations and insurance management these expenses are
allocated based on a combination of factors such as actual usage of the service
provided revenues gross salaries and fixed assets and may not reflect actual

relationship between packaging and tenneco are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements

incurred charges of 9337000 for health care and 1801000 for workers
compensation for the period ended april 11 1999

form a joint venture with caraustar industries whereby packaging sold its two
recycled paperboard mills and a fiber recycling operation and brokerage business

balance of the note with accrued interest is 27122000 the note was paid in
june 1999

16 subsequent events

impairment charge on the accompanying financial statements representing the
amount that was previously estimated by packaging pca intends to record the
remaining amount in september 1999

buyers to sell approximately 405000 acres of timberland pca has completed the

useful lives of the related assets the following useful lives are used for the
various categories of assets

    timber depletion is provided on the basis of timber cut during the period
related to the estimated quantity of recoverable timber assets under capital
leases are depreciated on the straightline method over the term of the lease

    expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred

    longlived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation
of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be
compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to
discounted cash flows is required

    deferred gain

    in 1992 packaging entered into a saleleaseback transaction for financial
reporting purposes involving certain of its timberlands the deferred gain
recognized upon sale is being amortized on a straightline basis over the

    changes in accounting principles

    in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities this statement establishes new accounting
and reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value the
statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires
that a company must formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that receive hedge accounting this statement is effective for all
fiscal years beginning after june 15 1999 the adoption of this new standard is
not expected to have a significant effect on the groups financial position or
results of operations

    in april 1998 the american institute of certified public accountants
aicpa issued statement of position sop 985 reporting on the costs of
startup activities which requires costs of startup activities to be expensed
as incurred this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
december 15 1998 the statement requires capitalized costs related to startup
activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle when the statement is adopted tenneco currently expects to adopt this
new accounting principle in the first quarter of 1999 the adoption of this new
standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the groups financial
position or results of operations

    in march 1998 the aicpa issued sop 981 accounting for the costs of
computer software developed or obtained for internal use which establishes new
accounting and reporting standards for the costs of computer software developed
or obtained for internal use this statement will be applied prospectively and
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 1998 the adoption of
this new standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the groups
financial position or results of operations

    freight trades

    the group regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers primarily
to reduce shipping costs the freight trade transactions are accounted for
primarily as transactions in the inventory accounts the impact on income is not
material

    environmental liabilities

    the estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance costs expected to
be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing operating landfill
areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to date amounts are
estimates using current technologies for closure and monitoring and are not
discounted

    the potential costs related to the group for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies liabilities recorded by the group for
environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon
available information and assumptions relating to the group because of these
uncertainties however the groups estimates may change the group believes
that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available
would not have a material effect on the combined statements of assets
liabilities and interdivision account or revenues expenses and interdivision
account of the group

    combined statements of cash flows

    as a division of packaging the group does not maintain separate cash
accounts other than for petty cash the groups disbursements for payroll
capital projects operating supplies and expenses are processed and funded by
packaging through centrally managed accounts in addition cash receipts from
the collection of accounts receivable and the sales of assets are remitted
directly to bank accounts controlled by packaging in this type of centrally
managed cash system in which the cash receipts and disbursements of packagings
various divisions are commingled it is not feasible to segregate cash received
from packaging eg as financing for the business from cash transmitted to
packaging eg as a distribution accordingly the net effect of these cash
transactions with packaging are presented as a single line item within the
financing section of the cash flow statements similarly the activity of the
interdivision account presents the net transfer of funds and charges between
packaging and the group as a single line item

    research and development

    research and development costs are expensed as incurred the amounts charged
were 3728000 4345000 and 4789000 in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively

    goodwill is being amortized on a straightline basis over 40 years such
amortization amounted to 1449000 1452000 and 1440000 for 1998 1997
and 1996 respectively goodwill totaling approximately 3463000 was written
off in 1998 related to a closed facility note 7

    the group has capitalized certain intangible assets primarily trademarks
and patents based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition
amortization is provided for these intangible assets on a straightline basis
over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years covenants not to compete are amortized
on a straightline basis over the terms of the respective agreements such
amortization amounted to 1127000 1234000 and 1416000 in 1998 1997 and
1996 respectively

    intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of any intangible assets may be impaired an evaluation
of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows through the remaining amortization
period associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying
amount to determine if a writedown to discounted cash flows is required

    use of estimates

    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

    reclassifications

    the prior years financial statements have been reclassified where
appropriate to conform to the 1998 presentation

    segment information

    the group adopted sfas no 131 disclosure about segments of an enterprise
and related information in 1998 and determined that the group is primarily
engaged in one line of business the manufacture and sale of packaging
materials boxes and containers for industrial and consumer markets no single
customer accounts for more than 10 of total revenues the group has no foreign
operations

    earnings per share unaudited

    earnings per share has been calculated using the historical earnings of the
group and the number of common shares resulting from the april 12 1999
transaction 430000 common shares as adjusted to reflect the anticipated
220forone stock split for all periods presented basic and diluted earnings
per share are the same because there are no potentially dilutive other

    the weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the benefit obligations was 700 for the year ended december 31 1998
and 775 for the years ended december 31 1997 and 1996 the weighted average
expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was 10 for 1998 1997 and

    middle management employees participate in a variety of incentive
compensation plans these plans provide for incentive payments based on the
achievement of certain targeted operating results and other specific business
goals the targeted operating results are determined each year by senior
management of packaging the amounts charged to expense for these plans were
5920000 6407000 and 6722000 in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively

    in june 1992 tenneco initiated an employee stock purchase plan espp
the plan allows us and canadian employees of the group to purchase
tenneco inc common stock through payroll deductions at a 15 discount each
year an employee in the plan may purchase shares with a discounted value not to
exceed 21250 the weighted average fair value of the employee purchase right
which was estimated using the blacksholes option pricing model and the
assumptions described below except that the average life of each purchase right
was assumed to be 90 days was 631 1109 and 1077 in 1998 1997 and 1996
respectively the espp was terminated as of september 30 1996 tenneco adopted
a new employee stock purchase plan effective april 1 1997 under the respective
espps tenneco sold 133223 shares 85024 shares and 73140 shares to group
employees in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively

    the fair value of each stock option issued by tenneco to the group during
1998 1997 and 1996 is estimated on the date of grant using the blacksholes
option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions for grants
in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively a riskfree interest rate of 57 67
and 60 b expected lives of 100 years 197 years and 50 years

for stock issued to employees to its stockbased compensation plans the group
recognized aftertax stockbased compensation expense of approximately 210000
in 1998 1997 and 1996 had compensation costs for the groups stockbased
compensation plans been determined in accordance with sfas 123 accounting for
stockbased compensation based on the fair value at the grant dates for the
awards under those plans the groups pro forma net income for the years ended
december 31 1998 1997 and 1996 would have been lower by 7828000
8205000 and 1874000 respectively

6 postretirement and postemployment benefits

    in addition to providing pension benefits the group provides certain health
care and life insurance benefits for certain retired and terminated employees a
substantial number of the groups employees may become eligible for such
benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the group the
cost of these benefits for salaried employees is allocated to the group by
packaging through a payroll charge and the interdivision account amounts
allocated are principally determined based on payroll the net obligation for
these salaried benefits is maintained by packaging and is not included in the
liabilities section of the accompanying combined statements of assets
liabilities and interdivision account for the groups share of the obligation

    currently the groups postretirement benefit plans are not funded and a
portion of the related postretirement obligation has been actuarially allocated
to the group however due to the fact that other divisions participate in the
plan certain of the disclosures required by sfas no 132 such as a summary of
the change in benefit obligation are not available the obligation of the

    the amounts expensed by the group may be different because it was allocated
by packaging

    the weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining
the 1998 and 1997 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 5 in 1997
remaining at that level thereafter

    the weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining
the 1996 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 60 in 1996
declining to 50 in 1997 and remaining at that level thereafter

    increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of september 30 1998 1997 and 1996 by approximately 1268000 868000 and
1103000 respectively and would increase the net postretirement benefit cost
for 1998 1997 and 1996 by approximately 130000 75000 and 102000
respectively

7 restructuring and other charges

    in the fourth quarter of 1998 the group recorded a pretax restructuring
charge of approximately 14 million this charge was recorded following the
approval by tennecos board of directors of a comprehensive restructuring plan
for all of tennecos operations including those of the group in connection
with this restructuring plan the group will close four corrugated facilities
and eliminate 109 positions the following table reflects components of this
charge

    asset impairments include goodwill totaling approximately 5043000 related
to two of the facilities the fixed assets at the closed facilities were written
down to their estimated fair value no significant cash proceeds are expected
from the ultimate disposal of these assets of the 7730000 remaining cash
charges at december 31 1998 approximately 7300000 is expected to be spent
in 1999 the actions contemplated by the restructuring plan should be completed
during the second quarter of 1999

8 income taxes

    the groups method of accounting for income taxes requires that a deferred
tax be recorded to reflect the tax expense benefit resulting from the
recognition of temporary differences temporary differences are differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the financial statements that will result in differences between income for tax
purposes and income for financial statement purposes in future years

    as a division this group is not a taxable entity for purposes of these
combined financial statements income taxes have been allocated to the group and
computed on a separate return basis these income taxes represent liabilities to
packaging and do not reflect any tax attributes of the tenneco consolidated tax
group

10 relatedparty transactions

    funding of cash requirements

    as discussed in note 2 packaging provides centralized treasury functions
and financing for the group including funding of its cash requirements for
processing of accounts payable and payroll requirements

    corporate allocations

    packaging and tenneco affiliates provide services to the group which are
typical of a consolidated entity with operations in several businesses these
services included general management investor and

10 relatedparty transactions continued
media relations legal human resources accounting public company reporting
data processing systems support training finance treasury and insurance
management these expenses were allocated to the group in the aggregate not
individually from packaging and tenneco affiliates based upon the relative
level of effort and time spent on group activities this was generally measured
using a formula based upon the groups percentage of tennecos fixed assets
revenues and payroll the group believes the method for the historical
allocations was reasonable

    as a standalone entity the group does not expect that it will incur a
similar level of costs due to a less complex corporate structure and a different
level of need for such services the group estimates it will incur approximately
30 million in standalone overhead costs in the first year following the
acquisition and believes this is representative of what the costs would have
been as a standalone entity for historical periods

    certain receivables and transactions resulting from the financing
relationship between packaging and tenneco are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements

    insurance and benefits

    the group is selfinsured for medical benefits and workers compensation
expenses related to workers compensation health care claims for hourly and
salaried workers and postretirement health care benefits for hourly and salaried
workers are determined by packaging and are allocated to the group the group
incurred charges of 32151000 34004000 and 32298000 in 1998 1997 and
1996 respectively for health care and 5109000 9209000 and 8853000 in
1998 1997 and 1996 respectively for workers compensation

    in general all costs and expenses incurred and allocated are based on the
relationship the group has with tenneco if the group had been a standalone
entity the costs and expenses would differ

11 commitments and contingencies

    the group had authorized capital expenditures of approximately 49392000
as of december 31 1998 in connection with the expansion and replacement of
existing facilities

    the group is involved in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and inhouse legal
counsel the outcome of such proceedings and litigation will not materially
affect the groups financial position or results of operations

12 leases

    rental expense included in the combined financial statements was
96193340 95284000 and 118821000 for 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively
these costs are primarily included in cost of goods sold

    on january 31 1997 packaging executed an operating lease agreement with
credit suisse leasing 92a lp and a group of financial institutions led by
citibank na the agreement refinanced the previous operating leases between
