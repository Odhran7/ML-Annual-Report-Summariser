risks relating to business strategy and operations 

negative global economic factors including global health pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation recessionary conditions geopolitical developments tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has created widespread disruption in the global economy and has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance as well as on the results of operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve and operate the duration of the pandemic itself and the market and workplace disruptions it has caused as well as the longterm effects on the economy and our customers are uncertain and as yet unknowable these 

factors as they become more certain could adversely affect our workforce sales and overall business furthermore the ultimate impact of global health pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to the impact of global health pandemics on global and regional economies including the impact of governmental business and individuals’ actions taken in response to such pandemics the availability of federal state or local pandemic relief programs general economic uncertainty in key financial markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery when the global health pandemic subsides we are unable to predict the extent to which global health pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations financial performance consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods 

trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors including the potential negative impact of global health pandemics such as covid19 affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems including thirdparty systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales consolidated results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on various computer systems including thirdparty systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past but none of these incidents individually or in the aggregate have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails or we are unable to successfully address security incidents production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

we also rely on software applications enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology services including our sap enterprise system payroll data risk management data and lease data if these thirdparty vendors as well as our suppliers and other vendors experience service interruptions or damage security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses ransomware or other similar events or intrusions our business and our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization our corporate culture along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract develop and retain key employees competitive pressures and labor shortages within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

we believe we have positive labor relationships with our employees however factors such as difficulty to attract key employees reduced employee engagement thirdparty organizational efforts and increased employee turnover could adversely affect our labor relationships with our employees a failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

unexpected events could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities severe weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes including those caused by climate change war or terrorist activities unplanned outages global health pandemics such as covid19 supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems in addition negative publicity whether warranted or not impacting brand image perception could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

financial risks 

our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business 

our outstanding indebtedness may have negative consequences on our business such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividend increases stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions in addition it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters environmental concerns including the impact of legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions and global health pandemics such as covid19 increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by but not limited to macroeconomic industry and market conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and consolidated results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended osha act we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot regulations the osha act and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current us presidential administration and congress may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal 

injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

increased global focus on climate change may result in the imposition of new or additional regulations or requirements applicable to and increased financial risks for our business and industry a number of government authorities and agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes to address climate change including the regulation of ghg emissions the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements including to fund energy efficiency activities or renewable energy use and fees or restrictions on certain activities or materials compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes additional investments in renewable energy use and other initiatives reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations we may not be able to timely recover the cost of compliance with such new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our ability to achieve our environmental social and governance goals are subject to risks many of which are outside of our control and our reputation and brands could be harmed if we fail to meet such goals 

companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to esg matters including practices and disclosures related to environmental stewardship social responsibility diversity equity and inclusion and workplace rights our ability to achieve our esg goals including our goal to achieve net zero ghg emissions by 2050 and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational financial legal and other risks and may be dependent on the actions of suppliers and other third parties all of which are outside of our control if we are unable to meet our esg goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues our reputation could be negatively impacted in addition in recent years investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on esg matters if as a result of their assessment of our esg practices certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress they may reconsider their investment in our company 

as the nature scope and complexity of esg reporting diligence and disclosure requirements expand including the sec’s recently proposed disclosure requirements regarding among other matters ghg emissions we may have to undertake additional costs to control assess and report on esg metrics any failure or perceived failure whether or not valid to pursue or fulfill our esg goals targets and objectives or to satisfy various esg reporting standards within the timelines we announce or at all could increase the risk of litigation 

increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could adversely impact our financial results 

changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or other tax law implementations or interpretations could increase our effective tax rate restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings or impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 

we are also subject to tax audits including with respect to transfer pricing in the us and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued 

that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition

cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an all other category cintas’ two reportable operating segments are uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services the remainder of cintas’ business which consists of the fire protection services operating segment and the uniform direct sale operating segment is included in all other these operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes revenue and income before income taxes for the reportable operating segments for the years ended may 31 2022 2021 and 2020 are presented in note 15 entitled operating segment information of  notes to consolidated financial statements  the company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate 

we have operations throughout the us and canada and participate in a global supply chain since fiscal 2020 the existence of the covid19 pandemic the fear associated with the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the covid19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations which had an adverse effect on our business many of cintas customers were also impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we saw an impact on some customers ability to pay timely while there was minimal disruption to our supply chain cintas did increase inventory primarily personal protective equipment and facility services inventory in response to the customer needs and demand associated with the safety and cleanliness requirements of covid19 the increase in inventory resulted in additional inventory reserves during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 see note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional detail on the incremental reserves placed on inventory the ongoing roll out of the covid19 vaccines and gradual lifting of covid19 restrictions had a positive impact on our business during fiscal 2022 the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which our business consolidated results of operations consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment all other and in total for the fiscal years ended may 31 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

fiscal 2022 total revenue was 79 billion an increase of 104 over the prior fiscal year revenue increased organically by 102 as a result of increased sales volume organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations total revenue was positively impacted by 01 due primarily to acquisitions and by 01 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

as previously discussed government enactments of temporary and indefinite closures of certain businesses in response to the covid19 pandemic continued to impact our ability to access and service some of our customers impacted by these mandates during fiscal 2021 the roll out of the covid19 vaccines and general lifting of covid19 restrictions had a positive impact on our business during fiscal 2022 due to the constantly changing impact of the covid19 pandemic uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery and about its impact on future cintas consolidated financial results 

organic revenue growth by quarter for fiscal 2022 is as follows 



uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased 94 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an organic growth increase of 90 revenue growth was positively impacted by 02 due primarily to acquisitions and by 02 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations organic revenue growth was a result of new business the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers the positive impact from the lifting of covid19 restrictions and price increases partially offset by lost business new business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives generally sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training which produce a higher number of products and services sold 

other revenue consisting of revenue from the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other increased 141 compared to fiscal 2021 revenue improved from increases in sales representative productivity and from the lifting of covid19 restrictions revenue increased organically by 149 revenue growth was negatively impacted by 08 due to divestitures 

cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 112 compared to fiscal 2021 cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other ancillary items the cost of uniform rental and facility services as a percent of revenue increased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased energy costs and investments in labor to support the increased revenue growth 

cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly first aid and safety products personal protective equipment uniforms and fire protection products delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other cost of other increased 107 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 but decreased as a percent of revenue to 557 compared to 573 in fiscal 2021 the improvement in cost of sales as a percent to revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in the sales mix for each of the underlying operating segments including a decrease in the proportion of sales related to personal protective equipment which typically have lower gross margins compared to the first aid cabinet sales in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment 

selling and administrative expenses increased 1157 million to 260 as a percent of revenue compared to 271 in fiscal 2021 the improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to lower labor expense as a percent of revenue as well as a 121 million gain on the sale of certain operating assets and a 302 million gain on an equity method investment transaction recorded in fiscal 2022 the impacts from the gains recorded in fiscal 2022 were partially offset by the 220 million gain on the sale of certain operating assets recorded in fiscal 2021 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income was 886 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 977 million in fiscal 2021 the change was primarily due to the replacement of the 2500 million of senior notes with an interest rate of 430 that matured on june 1 2021 with lower interest rate bearing commercial paper 

income before income taxes was 14988 million an increase of 2110 million or 164 compared to fiscal 2021 the increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growth and the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2022 income before income taxes also benefited from the previously mentioned onetime gains recorded in fiscal 2022 

cintas effective tax rate on continuing operations was 175 for fiscal 2022 compared to 137 in fiscal 2021 the effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items primarily the tax accounting impact for stockbased compensation in addition the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 included tax benefits from a gain on an equity method investment transaction in fiscal 2022 and the sale of certain operating assets in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 

net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2022 of 12358 million was a 112 increase compared to fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 1165 was a 138 increase compared to fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 1024 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the increase in net income combined with the decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding the decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing an aggregate of approximately 37 million shares of common stock under the board approved share buyback programs during fiscal 2022 

uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment 

uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment revenue increased 5373 million or 94 and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 3329 million or 112 due to the reasons previously discussed the reportable operating segments fiscal 2022 gross margin was 467 of revenue compared to 476 in fiscal 2021 the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a 50 basis point increase in energy costs and investments in labor to support the increased revenue growth 

selling and administrative expenses for the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased 768 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2022 was 250 compared to 260 in fiscal 2021 the improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to efficiencies in labor and the previously mentioned onetime gain of 302 million on an equity method investment transaction 

income before income taxes increased 1277 million to 13535 million for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 217 increased 20 basis points from 215 in fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to the previously discussed improvement in selling and administrative expenses partially offset by decreases in gross margin as a percent of revenue 

first aid and safety services reportable operating segment 

first aid and safety services reportable operating segment revenue increased 482 million in fiscal 2022 a 61 increase compared to fiscal 2021 revenue increased organically by 51 as a result of new business and sales productivity increases penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and sales of personal protective equipment in response to the covid19 pandemic revenue growth was positively impacted by 09 due to acquisitions and by 01 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

cost of sales for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment increased 83 million or 18 in fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher sales volume gross margin for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods warehouse expenses and service expenses gross margin as a percent of revenue was 447 for fiscal 2022 compared to 424 in fiscal 2021 the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of sales related to personal protective equipment which typically have lower gross margins compared to the first aid cabinet sales 

selling and administrative expenses for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment increased by 143 million or 57 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and improved as a percent of revenue to 319 in fiscal 2022 compared to 320 in fiscal 2021 the improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employeepartner related expenses 

income before income taxes for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment was 1068 million in fiscal 2022 an increase of 256 million or 315 compared to fiscal 2021 income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 128 increased from 104 in fiscal 2021 due to the previously discussed increases primarily in gross margin 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended may 31 



cash and cash equivalents as of may 31 2022 and 2021 include 431 million and 379 million respectively that is located outside of the us 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of longterm debt 

we expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity 

in addition we have access to 20 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility the maturity of which was extended on march 23 2022 until march 23 2027 we believe the company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment acquisitions repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the company 

net cash provided by operating activities was 154 billion for fiscal 2022 which was an increase of 1769 million or 130 compared to fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily the result of increased net income which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable and uniforms and other rental items in service which resulted from the growth in revenue in addition we had a favorable change in inventories net which was the result of a large amount of inventory purchases in the prior fiscal year period related to the covid19 pandemic including sanitizer sanitizer stands masks and gloves 

net cash used in investing activities was 4026 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 1372 million in fiscal 2021 net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures purchases of investments proceeds from the sale of operating assets and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses capital expenditures were 2407 million and 1435 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 included 1666 million for the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment and 597 million for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment the increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was due to an investment in the operating segments to support continued market penetration and revenue growth cash paid for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired was 1642 million and 100 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively the acquisitions in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 occurred in our uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment our first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and our fire protection operating segment which is included in all other the fiscal 2022 acquisitions also includes the acquisition of the remaining interest of an equity method investment in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 investing activities included proceeds of 153 million and 317 million respectively from the sale of certain operating assets net of cash disposed net cash used in investing activities also included 61 million and 43 million of purchases of investments during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively 

net cash used in financing activities was 15379 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 8799 million in fiscal 2021 the increase in cash used from financing activities from fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the increase in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2022 offset by the 2612 million net issuance of commercial paper and the 762 million higher dividends paid in fiscal 2021 due to the transition from an annual dividend payment in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to quarterly dividend payments thereafter on october 30 2018 we announced that the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share buyback program which was completed during fiscal 2021 on october 29 2019 we announced the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share buyback program which was completed during fiscal 2022 on july 27 2021 we announced the board of directors authorized a new 15 billion share buyback program which does not have an expiration date

the credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on march 23 2022 the amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 10 billion to 20 billion the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to 5000 million in the aggregate subject to customary conditions the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is march 23 2027 as of may 31 2022 there was 2612

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit cintas ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of both shortterm and longterm liquidity to meet material cash obligations we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past additionally our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2022 our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

  

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year longterm debt and standby letters of credit

covid19 pandemic 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china and has since spread globally in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic efforts to contain the spread of covid19 intensified during our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and have remained in effect throughout our fiscal 2021 most states and municipalities within the us as well as canada enacted temporary closures of businesses issued quarantine orders and took other restrictive measures in response to the covid19 pandemic many of the business closures quarantine orders and other restrictive measures remained in place through fiscal 2021 within the us our business was designated an essential business which allowed us to continue to serve customers that remained open during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter the roll out of vaccines lower covid19 case counts and lifting of restrictions on businesses had a positive impact on our business 

we have operations throughout the us and canada and participate in a global supply chain during most of fiscal 2021 the existence of the covid19 pandemic the fear associated with the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the covid19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products 

and impede the business of our customers impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations which had an adverse effect on our business many of cintas customers were also impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we saw an impact on some customers ability to pay timely while there was minimal disruption to our supply chain cintas did increase inventory primarily personal protective equipment and facility services inventory in response to the customer needs and demand associated with the safety and cleanliness requirements of covid19 the increase in inventory resulted in additional inventory reserves during fiscal 2021 and could result in future inventory reserve increases if demand for personal protective equipment declines see note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional detail on the additional reserve placed on inventory the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which our business consolidated results of operations consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted for more information see the sections entitled “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “ risk factors ” within this annual report on form 10k

risks relating to business strategy  operations 

negative global economic factors including the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has created widespread disruption in the global economy and has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance as well as on the results of operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve and operate the duration of the pandemic itself and the market and workplace disruptions it has caused including disruptions imposed by federal state and local actions as well as the potential for new government 

regulations and the longterm effects on the economy and our customers are uncertain and as yet unknowable these factors as they become more certain could adversely affect our workforce sales and overall business furthermore the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies the availability of federal state or local funding programs general economic uncertainty in key financial markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides we are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations financial performance consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods 

trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors including the potential negative impact of viral pandemics such as covid19 affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems including thirdparty systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales consolidated results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on various computer systems including thirdparty systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past but none of these incidents individually or in the aggregate have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails or we are unable to successfully address security incidents production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

we also rely on software applications enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology services including our sap enterprise system payroll data risk management data and lease data if these thirdparty vendors as well as our suppliers and other vendors experience service interruptions or damage security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses ransomware or other similar events or intrusions our business and our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization our corporate culture along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract develop and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

we believe we have positive labor relationships with our employees however factors such as difficulty to attract key employees reduced employee engagement thirdparty organizational efforts and increased employee turnover could adversely affect our labor relationships with our employees a failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

unexpected events could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities severe weather conditions natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages viral pandemics such as covid19 supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems in addition negative publicity whether warranted or not impacting brand image perception could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

financial risks 

our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business 

our outstanding indebtedness may have negative consequences on our business such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividend increases stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions in addition it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters environmental concerns and viral pandemics such as covid19 increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by but not limited to macroeconomic industry and market conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and consolidated results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal 

injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could adversely impact our financial results

cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an all other category cintas’ two reportable operating segments are uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services the remainder of cintas’ business which consists of the fire protection services operating segment and the uniform direct sale operating segment is included in all other these operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended may 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented in note 14 entitled operating segment information of  notes to consolidated financial statements  the company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china and has since spread globally in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic efforts to contain the spread of covid19 intensified during our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and have remained in effect throughout our fiscal 2021 most states and municipalities within the us as well as canada enacted temporary closures of businesses issued quarantine orders and took other restrictive measures in response to the covid19 pandemic many of the business closures quarantine orders and other restrictive measures remained in place through fiscal 2021 within the us our business was designated an essential business which allowed us to continue to serve customers that remained open during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter the roll out of vaccines lower covid19 case counts and lifting of restrictions on businesses had a positive impact on our business 

we have operations throughout the us and canada and participate in a global supply chain during most of fiscal 2021 the existence of the covid19 pandemic the fear associated with the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the covid19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations which had an adverse effect on our business many of cintas customers were also impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we saw an impact on some customers ability to pay timely while there was minimal disruption to our supply chain cintas did increase inventory primarily personal protective equipment and facility services inventory in response to the customer needs and demand associated with the safety and cleanliness requirements of covid19 the increase in inventory resulted in additional inventory reserves during fiscal 2021 and could result in future inventory reserve increases if demand for personal protective equipment declines see note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional detail on the additional reserve placed on inventory the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which our business consolidated results of operations consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

fiscal 2021 total revenue was 71 billion an increase of 04 over the prior fiscal year revenue increased organically by 02 as a result of increased sales volume organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and workday differences total revenue was negatively impacted by a net 03 due to acquisitions and divestitures positively impacted by 02 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and positively impacted by 03 due to one more workday in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

as previously discussed government enactments of temporary and indefinite closures of certain businesses in response to the covid19 pandemic continued to impact our ability to access and service some of our customers impacted by these mandates during fiscal 2021 due to the constantly changing impact of the covid19 pandemic uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery and about its impact on future cintas consolidated financial results

other revenue consisting of revenue from the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other decreased 10 compared to fiscal 2020 revenue improvement from increases in sales representative productivity and sales of personal protection equipment was more than offset by a decrease in sales related to customers in all other as a result of the impact from the covid19 pandemic revenue declined organically by 19 revenue growth was positively impacted by 05 due to revenue growth derived through acquisitions in our first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and our fire protection operating segment which is included in all other and by 04 due to one more workday in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of longterm debt 

the disruption from the covid19 pandemic continued to have an impact on cintas fiscal 2021 financial results however net cash flow provided by operating activities was not significantly impacted we expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of shortterm liquidity in addition we have access to 10 billion of shortterm debt from our revolving credit facility although the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve we believe our longterm liquidity position remains strong we believe the company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment acquisitions and dividends remain strategic objectives but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the company 

net cash provided by operating activities was 136 billion for fiscal 2021 which was an increase of 693 million compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily the result of increased net income and favorable changes in accrued compensation and other partially offset by changes in working capital specifically income taxes accounts receivable and accrued liabilities and other 

net cash used in investing activities was 1372 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 2854 million in fiscal 2020 net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures purchases of investments proceeds from the sale of operating assets and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses capital expenditures were 1435 million and 2303 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 included 1040 million for the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment and 344 million for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment the decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was due to reduced growth capacity needs within the slower growth landscape of the covid19 pandemic cash paid for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired was 100 million and 537 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively the acquisitions in both fiscal 2021 and 2020 occurred in our uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment our first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and our fire protection operating segment which is included in all other in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 investing activities included proceeds of 317 million and 133 million respectively from the sale of certain operating assets net of 

cash disposed net cash used in investing activities also included 43 million and 100 million of purchases of investments during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

net cash used in financing activities was 8799 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 9552 million in fiscal 2020 the decrease in cash used from financing activities from fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the payment of the 3125 million of debt in fiscal 2020 partially offset by an increase in cash used to pay dividends and repurchase common stock in fiscal 2021 on october 30 2018 we announced that the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share buyback program which was completed during fiscal 2021 on october 29 2019 we announced the board of directors authorized a new 10 billion share buyback program which does not have an expiration date the following table summarizes the buyback activity by program and fiscal year ended may 31

on october 27 2020 cintas declared an annual cash dividend on outstanding common stock representing a 102 increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior fiscal year this marked the 38 th consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend every year since going public in 1983 also on october 27 2020 the cintas board of directors approved a change in the dividend policy from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend and subsequently declared a quarterly dividend on outstanding common stock any future dividend declarations including the amount of any dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors and dependent upon thenexisting conditions including the companys consolidated operating results and consolidated financial condition capital requirements contractual restrictions business prospects and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant our board of directors declared the following dividends during the fiscal years ended may 31 



1 the dividend declared on april 13 2021 was included in current accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at may 31 2021 

during the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 cintas paid a net total of 1125 million on commercial paper borrowings and paid off the term loan balance of 2000 million with cash on hand there was no commercial paper outstanding during fiscal 2021 the following table summarizes cintas outstanding debt at may 31 



1 cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of gk in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and they were recorded at fair value the interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate the principal amount of these notes is 500 million with a stated interest rate of 373 

2 cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of gk in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and they were recorded at fair value the interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate the principal amount of these notes is 500 million with a stated interest rate of 388 

the credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on may 24 2019 the amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 6000 million to 10 billion and created a new term loan of 2000 million the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to 2500 million in the aggregate subject to customary conditions the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is may 23 2024 as of may 31 2021 and 2020 there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our credit facility on june 1 2021 in accordance with the terms of the notes cintas paid the 2500 million aggregate principal amount of its 430 10year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand during fiscal 2022 cintas expects to issue longterm debt to pay the 6500 million principal amount of its 290 5year senior notes that mature in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit cintas ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past including our ability to refinance the 6500 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that mature in fiscal 2022 additionally our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness 

as of may 31 2021 our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

  

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year longterm debt and standby letters of credit

new accounting standards 

in april 2019 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201613 “financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” asu 201613 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates in connection with recognizing credit losses on accounts receivable and other financial instruments cintas now uses a forwardlooking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model adoption of asu 201613 requires using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align existing credit loss methodology with the new standard this standard was adopted by cintas on june 1 2020 and did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities therefore the company has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods cintas accounts for global intangible lowtaxed income gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred see note 9 entitled income taxes of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate

we have operations throughout the us and participate in a global supply chain during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the existence of the covid19 pandemic the fear associated with the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the covid19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations which had an adverse effect on our business if we need to close any of our facilities or a critical number of our employees become too ill to work our business operations could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner similarly if our customers experience adverse business consequences due to the covid19 pandemic including being required to shut down their operations demand for our services and products could also be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted for more information see the sections entitled “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “ risk factors ” within this annual report on form 10k 

we provide our products and services to over one million businesses of all types from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas

additional information regarding each reportable operating segment and all other is also included in note 1 4 entitled operating segment information of  notes to consolidated financial statements  

the primary markets served by all cintas businesses are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our businesses

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates” “anticipates” “predicts” “projects” “plans” “expects” “intends” “target” “forecast” “believes” “seeks” “could” “should” “may” and “will” or the negative versions thereof and similar words terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety the effect on operations of exchange rate fluctuations tariffs and other political economic and regulatory risks uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the effect of new accounting pronouncements disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data including cybersecurity risks the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events including viral pandemics such as the covid19 coronavirus the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise as required by law the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors including the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has created widespread disruption in the global economy and is having an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance as well as on the results of operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve and operate the duration of the pandemic itself and the market and workplace disruptions it has caused including disruptions imposed by federal state and local actions as well as the potential for new government regulations and the longterm effects on the economy and our customers are uncertain and as yet unknowable these factors as they become more certain could adversely affect our workforce sales and overall business furthermore the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance depends on 

many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies the availability of federal state or local funding programs general economic uncertainty in key financial markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides we are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations financial performance consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business 

our outstanding indebtedness may have negative consequences on our business such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividend increases stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions in addition it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters environmental concerns and viral pandemics such as covid19 increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

while we believe that our employee relations are good we have been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors including the potential negative impact of viral pandemics such as covid19 affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and 

regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current us presidential administration and congress may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems including thirdparty systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales consolidated results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on various computer systems including thirdparty systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions such as our current conversion to sap enterprise system power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cyber 

security attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

we also rely on software applications enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology services including our sap enterprise system payroll data risk management data and lease data if these thirdparty vendors as well as our suppliers and other vendors experience service interruptions or damage security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses ransomware or other similar events or intrusions our business and our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities severe weather conditions natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages viral pandemics such as covid19 supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems in addition negative publicity whether warranted or not impacting brand image perception could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by but not limited to macroeconomic industry and market conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value 

for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and consolidated results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could adversely impact our financial results 

changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or other tax law implementations or interpretations could increase our effective tax rate restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings or impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 

we are also subject to tax audits including with respect to transfer pricing in the us and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations focuses on discussion of fiscal 2020 results compared to 2019 results for discussion of fiscal 2019 results compared to fiscal 2018 results see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” within our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 31 2019 filed with the sec on july 26 2019 

cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an all other category cintas’ two reportable operating segments are the uniform rental and facility services operating segment and the first aid and safety services operating segment the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services the remainder of cintas’ business which consists of fire protection services operating segment and the uniform direct sale operating segment is included in all other these operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended may 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are presented in note 14 entitled operating segment information of  notes to consolidated financial statements  the company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate 

in march 2020 the world health organization characterized a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic through the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business however efforts to contain the spread of covid19 intensified during our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter most states and municipalities within the us enacted temporary closures of businesses issued quarantine orders and took other restrictive measures in response to the covid19 pandemic within the us our business was designated an essential business which allowed us to continue to serve customers that remained open 

we have operations throughout the us and participate in a global supply chain during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the existence of the covid19 pandemic the fear associated with the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the covid19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations which had an adverse effect on our business 

in response to the impact of covid19 cintas put in place health and safety measures to keep cintas employees contractors and customers safe these health and safety measures have not materially impacted our ability to service our customers many of cintas customers were also impacted by covid19 and we did see an impact on some customers ability to pay while there was minimal disruption to our supply chain cintas did experience an increase in inventory caused by the impact of covid19 see note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional detail on steps taken to assess the higher collection risk related to our customers and the additional reserve placed on inventory 

cintas also initiated certain activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 cintas recorded 245 million in employee termination costs and 92 million in longlived asset impairment costs see n ote 1 entitled significant accounting policies of  notes to consolidated financial statements  the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which our business consolidated results of operations consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment all other and in total for the fiscal years ended may 31 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

fiscal 2020 total revenue was 71 billion an increase of 28 over the prior fiscal year revenue increased organically by 31 as a result of increased sales volume organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and workday differences total revenue was positively impacted by 02 due to acquisitions negatively impacted by 01 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

as previously discussed the government enactment of temporary closures of certain businesses in response to covid19 impacted our ability to service some of our customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by covid19 due to the constantly changing impact of covid19 uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery and about its impact on future cintas consolidated financial results 

organic growth by quarter for fiscal 2020 is as follows 



uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased 16 compared to fiscal 2019 due to an organic growth increase of 20 revenue growth was positively impacted by 01 due to acquisitions negatively impacted by 01 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 revenue growth was a result of new business the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases partially offset by lost business new business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives generally sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training which produce a higher number of products and services sold 

other revenue consisting of revenue from the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other increased 76 compared to fiscal 2019 revenue increased organically by 75 primarily due to improved sales representative productivity and the increased sales of personal protective equipment offset by a decrease in sales related to customers in all other as a result of the impact from covid19 revenue growth was positively impacted by 05 due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 09 compared to fiscal 2019 cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other ancillary items the cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2019 was due to increased uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment sales volume from organic growth partially offset by fewer inventory purchases and a reduced amount of inventory put in service during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 

cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly first aid and safety products uniforms and fire protection products delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other cost of other increased 82 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and an increase in the proportion of sales from personal protective equipment 

selling and administrative expenses increased 904 million or 46 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in labor and other employeepartner related expenses in addition as previously discussed cintas 

initiated certain activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 cintas recorded 245 million in employee termination costs and 92 million in longlived asset impairment costs 

operating income in fiscal 2019 was negatively impacted by 144 million of integration expenses incurred in connection with the gk services inc gk acquisition the aftertax effect of these integration expenses represents a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of 010 per share in fiscal 2019 no material integration expenses were recorded in fiscal 2020 

during fiscal 2019 cintas sold a cost method investment for 733 million resulting in a pretax gain of 694 million the aftertax effect of the onetime gain represents a positive impact on diluted earnings per share of 047 per share 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income was 1044 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1005 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2020 was due to the timing of interest being incurred on our term loan in the current year twelve months as opposed to one month in fiscal 2019 partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

income before income taxes was 10583 million a decrease of 441 million or 40 compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease in income before income taxes was primarily due to the negative impact of covid19 as previously discussed as well as the fiscal 2019 onetime gain on sale of a cost method investment 

cintas effective tax rate on continuing operations was 172 for fiscal 2020 compared to 199 in fiscal 2019 the effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain permanent differences primarily the tax accounting for stockbased compensation 

net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 of 8764 million was a 07 decrease compared to fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 811 was a 18 increase compared to fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 797 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the positive impact from the lower diluted weighted average common shares outstanding during fiscal 2020 

uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment 

uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment revenue increased 911 million or 16 and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 275 million or 09 due to the reasons previously discussed the reportable operating segments fiscal 2020 gross margin was 459 of revenue compared to 455 in fiscal 2019 the increase in gross margin was driven by new business sold by sales representatives penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and continuous improvements in process efficiency 

selling and administrative expenses for the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased 501 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2020 was 281 compared to 276 in fiscal 2019 the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to increases in labor and other employeepartner related expenses as well as impacts caused by covid19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment initiated certain activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the reportable operating segment recorded 202 million in employee termination costs and 92 million in longlived asset impairment costs due to the constantly changing impact of covid19 it is uncertain if similar additional activities will be initiated in the future 

the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment incurred 144 million of integration expenses directly related to the gk acquisition in fiscal 2019 which consisted primarily of facility closure expenses there were no such expenses incurred in fiscal 2020 

income before income taxes increased 278 million to 10046 million for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 178 increased 20 basis points from 176 in fiscal 2019 the increase was primarily due to the increase in gross margin which was partially offset by the previously discussed impacts of covid19

first aid and safety services reportable operating segment revenue increased 891 million in fiscal 2020 a 144 increase compared to fiscal 2019 revenue increased organically by 148 as a result of new business and sales productivity increases penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and sales of personal protective equipment in response to covid19 revenue growth was negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

cost of sales for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment increased 475 million or 147 in fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher sales volume gross margin for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods warehouse expenses service expenses and training expenses the gross margin as a percent of revenue was 478 for fiscal 2020 compared to 480 in fiscal 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the proportion of sales of personal protective equipment as a result of the impact of covid19 

selling and administrative expenses for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment increased by 248 million or 120 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to increased labor and other employeepartner related expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 327 in fiscal 2020 compared to 334 in fiscal 2019 the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employeepartner related expenses 

income before income taxes for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment was 1069 million in fiscal 2020 an increase of 168 million or 187 compared to fiscal 2019 income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 151 increased from 145 in fiscal 2019 due to the previously discussed growth in revenue and improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended may 31 



cash and cash equivalents as of may 31 2020 and 2019 include 302 million and 285 million respectively that is located outside of the us 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of longterm debt 

the disruption from covid19 negatively impacted cintas fiscal 2020 fourth quarter financial results however net cash flow provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was not significantly impacted at may 31 2020 our shortterm liquidity position remained solid as our cash flows from operating activities are expected to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of shortterm liquidity in addition we have access to 10 billion of shortterm debt from our revolving credit facility however our longterm liquidity position remains unclear due to the constantly changing scope and nature of the impacts of covid19 accordingly we have taken proactive measures to maintain financial flexibility within the landscape of the covid19 pandemic we believe the company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment as a result of these actions in order to preserve cash during this time of uncertainty we plan to limitreduce capital expenditures to essential business needs also we will limit share buybacks until we obtain more certainty regarding the impacts of covid19 acquisitions and dividends remain strategic objectives however they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the company 

net cash provided by operating activities was 13 billion for fiscal 2020 which was an increase of 2236 million compared to fiscal 2019 the increase was primarily the result of favorable changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable and inventories 

net cash used in investing activities was 2854 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 2356 million in fiscal 2019 net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures purchases of investments proceeds from the sale of assets cost method investments and businesses and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses capital expenditures were 2303 million and 2767 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 included 1834 million for the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment and 357 million for the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment cash paid for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired was 537 million and 98 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively the acquisitions in both fiscal 2020 and 2019 occurred in our uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment our first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and our fire protection operating segment which is included in all other in fiscal 2020 investing activities included proceeds of 133 million from the sale of assets and in fiscal 2019 included proceeds of 733 million from the sale of a cost method investment and 32 million from the sale of a business included in discontinued operations net cash used in investing activities also included 100 million and 178 million of investment purchases during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively 

net cash used in financing activities was 9552 million for fiscal 2020 compared to 8733 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in cash used from financing activities from fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the payment of the 3125 million of debt in fiscal 2020 versus issuance of 3125 million of debt in fiscal 2019 partially offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock on august 2 2016 we announced that the board of directors authorized a 5000 million share buyback program this program was completed in november 2018 on october 30 2018 we announced that the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share buyback program which does not have an expiration date on october 29 2019 we announced the board of directors authorized a new 10 billion share buyback program which does not have an expiration date the following table summarizes the buyback activity by program and fiscal year ended may 31 



there were no share buybacks in the period subsequent to may 31 2020 through july 29 2020 under any share buyback program from the inception of the october 30 2018 share buyback program through july 29 2020 cintas has purchased a total of 43 million shares of cintas common stock at an average price of 21942 for a total purchase price of 9391 million in addition for the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 cintas acquired 03 million shares of cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year these shares were acquired at an average price of 26089 per share for a total purchase price of 688 million for the fiscal year ended may 31 2019 cintas acquired 03 million shares of cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted awards that vested during the fiscal year these shares were acquired at an average price of 20450 per share for a total purchase price of 629 million 

on october 29 2019 cintas declared an annual cash dividend of 255 per share on outstanding common stock a 244 increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior year the dividend was paid on december 6 2019 to shareholders of record as of november 8 2019 this marked the 37 th consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend every year since going public in 1983 

during the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 cintas paid a net total of 1125 million on commercial paper borrowings and paid off the term loan balance of 2000 million with cash on hand during the fiscal year ended may 31 2019 cintas issued 1125 million net of commercial paper borrowings and received proceeds of 2000 million as a result of a new term loan 

the following table summarizes cintas outstanding debt at may 31 



1 variable rate debt instrument the rate presented is the variable borrowing rate at may 31 2019 

2 cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of gk in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and they were recorded at fair value the interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate the principal amount of these notes is 500 million with a stated interest rate of 373 

3 cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of gk in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and they were recorded at fair value the interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate the principal amount of these notes is 500 million with a stated interest rate of 388 

the credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on may 24 2019 the amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 6000 million to 10 billion and created a new term loan of 2000 million the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to 2500 million in the aggregate subject to customary conditions the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is may 23 2024 and the maturity date of the term loan was may 23 2020 as of may 31 2020 there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our credit facility as of may 31 2019 there was 1125 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 27 and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit cintas ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past however the covid19 pandemic which has caused disruption in the capital markets could make financing more difficult andor expensive additionally our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness 

as of may 31 2020 our ratings were as follows 



standard and poors change in outlook from stable to negative reflects the inherent uncertainty regarding the spread of covid19 and the potential impact to cintas’ operating conditions which could result in cintas being unable to maintain adjusted leverage of less than two times total debt to ebitda 

in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

  

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year longterm debt and standby letters of credit 

we have assessed the impact of events subsequent to our balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of this filing the impact from covid19 however continues to evolve and the scope and nature of the impacts of covid19 remain unclear as such our conclusions regarding both our shortterm and longterm liquidity position remain unchanged management will continue to evaluate the company’s liquidity position and our near and longerterm financial performance as we manage the company through the uncertainty related to covid19

new accounting standards 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201602 “leases topic 842” as amended cintas adopted this standard effective june 1 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach topic 842 requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease a lessee is also required to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification topic 842 provided a number of optional practical expedients in transition and we have determined to use certain of these practical expedients upon our adoption of topic 842 specifically the company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under topic 842 which allows a lessee to carryforward their population of existing leases the classification of each lease as well as the treatment of initial direct lease costs as of the period of adoption the company also elected the practical expedient related to lease and nonlease components as an accounting policy election for the fleet and vehicle asset class which allows a lessee to not separate nonlease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component in addition the company elected the shortterm lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less which means it will not recognize rightofuse assets or lease liabilities for these leases the adoption of topic 842 on june 1 2019 resulted in the company recognizing rightofuse assets net of 1680 million and corresponding lease liabilities of 1734 million the adoption of topic 842 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 income statement  reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income this standard allows entities to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings effective june 1 2019 cintas adopted asu 201802 on a prospective basis which resulted in a 20 million reclassification adjustment of the stranded tax effects from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive loss that was determined using a specific identification method 

in april 2019 the fasb issued asu 201613 “financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” asu 201613 will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates in connection with recognizing credit losses on accounts receivable and other financial instruments cintas will be required to use a forwardlooking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model asu 201613 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this standard will be through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date cintas will adopt this standard on june 1 2020 and the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” asu 201704 eliminates the twostep process that required identification of potential impairment and a separate measure of the actual impairment goodwill impairment charges if any would be determined by the difference between a reporting units carrying value and its fair value impairment loss is limited to the carrying value this standard was adopted by cintas in the current fiscal year and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 to clarify revenue recognition principles this guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers we adopted asu 201409 and all the related amendments effective june 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method asu 201409 requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services upon adoption of asu 201409 we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of june 1 2018 the adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs required by the new guidance capitalized costs are amortized ratably over the anticipated period of benefit we applied asu 201409 only to contracts that were not completed prior to fiscal 2019 the adoption of asu 201409 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and had no impact to the companys operating cash flow 

in march 2020 the sec amended rule 310 of regulation sx regarding financial disclosure requirements for registered debt offerings involving subsidiaries as either issuers or guarantors and affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral this new guidance narrows the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamlines the alternative disclosure required in lieu of those statements we adopted these amendments for the year ended may 31 2020 accordingly combined summarized financial information has been presented only for the issuer and guarantors of our senior notes for the most recent fiscal year and the yeartodate interim period and the location of the required disclosures has been removed from the notes to the consolidated financial statements and moved to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of  notes to consolidated financial statements  significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies including those impacted by covid19 could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment is recognized when services are performed other revenue which is recorded in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segments and all other is recognized when either services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied see note 2 entitled revenue recognition of the  notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information on cintas revenue 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and cintas specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate as a result of certain restructuring activities to eliminate excess capacity and reduce our cost structure an indicator of potential impairment was identified cintas recognized an impairment loss of 92 million during the year ended may 31 2020 based on the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their respective fair values the undiscounted cash flows were estimated using level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches at the lowest discernible level of cash flows which is at the location level cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended may 31 2019 and 2018 

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance in fiscal 2020 we identified the impact from covid19 as a qualitative factor that necessitated a quantitative analysis we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment uniform rental and facility services first aid and safety services and two reporting units within all other to test for goodwill impairment using a quantitative analysis we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a marketbased approach 

the impairment test is dependent upon a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions growth rates competitive activities cost containment margin expansion and our business plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable however future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values the most significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are the revenue and ebitda growth rates including terminal growth rates and the discount rate the terminal growth rate represents the rate at which the reporting unit is expected to grow beyond the shorterterm business planning period the terminal growth rate utilized in our fair value estimate is consistent with the reporting unit operating plans and approximates expected longterm category market growth rates and inflation the discount rate which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant is based upon industry required rates of return including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure the discount rates may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment specifically the covid19 pandemic volatility in the equity and debt markets or other factors based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2020 2019 or 2018 cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years the gk service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15year term certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2020 2019 or 2018 

insurance reserve 

the insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims primarily related to workers compensation auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures with the assistance of thirdparty actuarial specialists of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model generally measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 12 entitled stockbased compensation of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for further information 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities therefore the company has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods cintas accounts for global intangible lowtaxed income gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred see note 9 entitled income taxes of  notes to consolidated financial statements  for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings may be affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments if any in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 04 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates” “anticipates” “predicts” “projects” “plans” “expects” “intends” “target” “forecast” “believes” “seeks” “could” “should” “may” and “will” or the negative versions thereof and similar words terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to risks inherent with the gk transaction in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof including whether the transaction will be accretive and within the expected timeframe and the actual amounts of future integration expenses the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions including gk fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety the effect on operations of exchange rate fluctuations tariffs and other political economic and regulatory risks uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the effect of new accounting pronouncements costs of our sap system implementation disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data including cybersecurity risks the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise as required by law the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business 

our outstanding indebtedness may have negative consequences on our business such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividend increases stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions in addition it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

while we believe that our employee relations are good we have been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other 

factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current us presidential administration and congress may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations including those acquired in the gk acquisition while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due 

diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions such as our current conversion to sap enterprise system power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities severe weather conditions natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems in addition negative publicity whether warranted or not impacting brand image perception could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could adversely impact our financial results 

changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or other tax law implementations or interpretations could increase our effective tax rate restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings or impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 

we are also subject to tax audits including with respect to transfer pricing in the united states and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

cash and cash equivalents as of may 31 2019  and 2018  include 285 million and 339 million respectively that is located outside of the united states 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of longterm debt 

net cash provided by operating activities was 11 billion  for fiscal 2019  which was an increase of 1037 million  compared to fiscal 2018  the increase was the result of higher net income and favorable changes in deferred taxes partially offset by changes in working capital

the following table summarizes cintas outstanding debt at may 31 



1    variable rate debt instrument the rate presented is the variable borrowing rate at may 31 2019 

 the credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on may 24 2019  the amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 6000 million  to 10 billion  and created a new term loan of 2000 million  the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to 2500 million  in the aggregate subject to customary conditions the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is may 22 2024 and the maturity date of the term loan is may 22 2020 which can be extended 12 months annually for up to four years as of may 31 2019 there was 1125 million  of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 27  and maturity dates less than 30 days and no  borrowings on our revolving credit facility no  commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2018 

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit cintas ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2019  our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

  

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt longterm obligations under capital leases and standby letters of credit 

contractual obligations

new accounting standards 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 to clarify revenue recognition principles this guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers we adopted asu 201409 and all the related amendments effective june 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method asu 201409 requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services upon adoption of asu 201409 we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of june 1 2018 the adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs required by the new guidance capitalized costs are amortized ratably over the anticipated period of benefit we applied asu 201409 only to contracts that were not completed prior to fiscal 2019 results for reporting periods beginning after may 31 2018 are presented under asu 201409 while comparative prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be presented under accounting standards in effect in those periods 

there were two implementation adjustments upon adoption of asu 201409 1 capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs and 2 the timing of revenue recognition for certain contracts with customers that create an asset with no alternative use to the company and an enforceable right of payment from the customer upon termination adoption of asu 201409 impacted the companys previously reported results as of may 31 2018 as follows 

capitalization of contract costs the company has elected to apply the guidance as a practical expedient to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics because the company reasonably expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying this guidance to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this guidance to the individual contracts within the portfolio the company also continues to expense certain costs to obtain a contract if those costs do not meet the criteria of the new standard or the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less 

assets with no alternative use     for our uniform direct sale business our revenue prior to the adoption of asu 201409 was primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers as products are shipped and title passes to the customers for certain contracts with customers the company creates an asset with no alternative use to the company and the company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date for these contracts we have moved from a pointintime model to an overtime model in which our measure of progress is finished goods with no alternative use in accordance with the provisions of asu 201409 we expect asu 201409 will have no cash impact and will not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts 



the impacts of adopting asu 201409 on our fiscal 2019 consolidated financial statements are presented in the following tables 





the adoption of asu 201409 had no impact to the companys fiscal 2019 operating cash flow and the only impact of the adoption on our fiscal 2019 consolidated statement of comprehensive income was the impact to net income as presented in the table above 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” as amended the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease respectively a lessee is also required to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification topic 842 provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition and we have determined to use certain of these practical expedients the company plans to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under topic 842 which allows a lessee to carryforward their population of existing leases the classification of each lease as well as the treatment of initial direct costs as of the period of adoption the company also plans to elect the practical expedient related to lease and nonlease components as an accounting policy election for all asset classes which allows a lessee to not separate nonlease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component in addition the company plans to elect the shortterm lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less which means it will not recognize rightofuse assets or lease liabilities for these leases the company does not expect to elect the useofhindsight practical expedient this guidance will be adopted by the company on june 1 2019 in accordance with topic 842 a registrant can elect not to present comparative financial information under topic 842 if it recognizes a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption the company intends to make this transition election the company has implemented a new lease system in connection with the adoption of topic 842 the majority of our lease spend relates to certain real estate with the remaining lease spend primarily related to vehicles and equipment based on the companys portfolio of leases at may 31 2019 approximately 1600 million to 1850 million  of lease assets and liabilities will be recognized on the balance sheet upon adoption we do not expect a material impact on the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows the company is substantially complete with its implementation efforts

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and cintas specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended may 31 2019 and 2018 

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level cintas has identified four  reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment uniform rental and facility services first aid and safety services and two  reporting units within all other based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2019  2018  or 2017  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years the gk service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years  which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15year term certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2019  2018  or 2017  

business combinations 

accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income 

  

general insurance liabilities 

general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred primarily related to workers compensation auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model generally measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 13 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 9 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings may be affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments if any in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 11 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

we provide our products and services to over one million businesses of all types from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth cintas total revenue and the revenue derived from each reportable operating segment and all other 



additional information regarding each reportable operating segment and all other is also included in note 14 entitled operating segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas businesses are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our businesses 

within the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives in total cintas has approximately 11100 local delivery routes 474 operational facilities and 11  distribution centers at may 31 2018  cintas employed approximately 41000 employees of which approximately 1600 were represented by labor unions

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of its costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 20 million in fiscal 2018  and approximately 14 million in fiscal 2017  capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances totaled approximately 2 million in fiscal 2018  and approximately 3 million in fiscal 2017  as a result of the gk acquisition in fiscal 2017 cintas environmental spend and the cost or environmental compliance could increase in future years however cintas is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates” “anticipates” “predicts” “projects” “plans” “expects” “intends” “target” “forecast” “believes” “seeks” “could” “should” “may” and “will” or the negative versions thereof and similar words terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to risks inherent with the gk transaction in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof including whether the transaction will be accretive and within the expected timeframe and the actual amounts of future integration expenses the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions including gk fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety the effect on operations of exchange rate fluctuations tariffs and other political economic and regulatory risks uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the effect of new accounting pronouncements costs of our sap system implementation disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data including cybersecurity risks the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise as required by law the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business 

our outstanding indebtedness including the indebtedness we incurred to consummate the gk transaction may have negative consequences on our business such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividend increases stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions in addition it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

following the gk transaction more of our labor force is unionized while we believe that our employee relations are good we have been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost 

inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current us presidential administration and congress may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations including those acquired in the gk acquisition while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased 

have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions such as our current conversion to sap enterprise system power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the 

estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

if we are unable to accurately predict our future tax liabilities or become subject to increased levels of taxation or our tax contingencies are unfavorably resolved our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the united states recently adopted tax reform legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act which will increase our effective income tax rate by imposing a new tax regime impacting our nonus operations the us tax changes also provide flexibility related to repatriating nonus earnings to the united states without additional us taxation and as a result we have changed classification of certain earnings that were previously deemed to be permanently reinvested offshore and recorded deferred tax liabilities for the associated withholding taxes other changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business including the united states or changes in how the tax cuts and jobs act or other tax laws are implemented or interpreted could further increase our effective tax rate further restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings or impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 

we are also subject to tax audits including with respect to transfer pricing in the united states and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

the credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended on september 16 2016 the amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 4500 million  to 6000 million  and added a 2500 million  term loan facility the existing term loan facility was paid in full during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to 2500 million  in the aggregate subject to customary conditions the maturity date of the agreement is september 15 2021 no  commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2018 as of may 31 2017 there was 505 million  of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 124  and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit cintas ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2018  our ratings were as follows 



on june 11 2018 standard  poors rating agency updated their ratings as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

  

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

on december 22 2017 the united states adopted tax reform legislation commonly known as the tax act which is generally effective january 1 2018 the tax act includes a number of changes to us tax law including lowering the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to 21 and changing or limiting certain tax deductions in addition the tax act alters the landscape of taxation of nonus operations and provides immediate deductions for certain new investments among other provisions 

cintas has reasonably estimated the effects of the tax act to be a net income tax benefit of 1614 million for fiscal 2018 the significant components of this income tax benefit include i the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower enacted us corporate tax rate which resulted in a net 1756 million decrease in income tax expense ii a 44 million net tax expense comprised of foreign withholding taxes related to certain nonus earnings subject to repatriation and iii 98 million in transition tax related to certain nonus earnings subject to repatriation that were previously tax deferred 

the overall net impact of the tax act resulted in a net decrease in cintas’ effective tax rates in fiscal 2018 and we anticipate the net impact of the tax act on future periods to also be a net decrease in our effective tax rates while the reduction in the us federal tax rate from 35 to 21 in fiscal 2018 and beyond will result in lower income tax expense other elements of the tax act will partially offset this reduction elements of the tax act that will cause an increase in future income tax expense include 

• the tax act expands the limitation on the deduction of certain executive compensation this expansion is subject to transition rules that provide relief for previously awarded compensation we estimate that this deduction limitation will adversely impact our effective rate in future periods 

• the tax act limits certain entertainment deductions 

• the tax act eliminates the section 199 deduction 

the estimated impacts of the tax act recorded during fiscal 2018 as well as the forwardlooking estimates are provisional in nature and cintas will continue to assess the impact of the tax act and provide additional information and record adjustments through the income tax provision in the relevant period as amounts are known and reasonably estimable during the measurement period accordingly the impact of the tax act may differ from our provisional estimates due to among other factors information currently not available changes in interpretations and the issuance of additional guidance as well as changes in assumptions cintas has made including actions cintas may take in fiscal 2019 as a result of the tax act 

contractual obligations 



 cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans and may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be 625 million  in the next year 1345 million  in the next two to three years and 1483 million  in the next four to five years future contributions to the defined benefit plans are expected to be 43 million  in the next year 56 million  in the next two to three years and 56 million  in the next four to five years 

other commitments 



 inflation and changing prices 

changes in wages benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas consolidated financial results management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings insurance receipts legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of cintas 

new accounting standards 

in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201408 “reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” which amended accounting guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity the amended guidance changes the thresholds for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures cintas adopted asu 201408 during the quarter ended august 31 2015 and applied the amended accounting guidance to shredit and all subsequent transactions as appropriate 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 to clarify revenue recognition principles the standard applies one comprehensive revenue recognition model across all contracts entities and sectors the core principal of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard includes cost guidance whereby all direct and incremental costs to obtain or fulfill a contract will be capitalized and amortized over the corresponding period of benefit determined on a contract by contract basis this guidance is also intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers cintas adopted this standard on june 1 2018 the largest impacts to the company’s financial statements will result from the new qualitative and quantitative disclosures that will be required upon adoption of the new standard there will be two implementation adjustments upon adoption of the new standard related to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs and the timing of revenue recognition for certain contracts with customers that create an asset with no alternative use to the company the company will apply the modified retrospective adoption alternative for this standard and anticipates recognizing a cumulative effect adjustment in the range of approximately 1850 million  to 2150 million  of an increase to retained earnings as of june 1 2018 which primarily reflects the deferral of contract costs 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu 201503 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated condensed balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of 

that debt liability consistent with debt discounts this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 the guidance is applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted cintas adopted asu 201503 during the quarter ended august 31 2016 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its longterm debt and other assets for all periods presented 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” which sets out the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract ie lessees and lessors the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease respectively a lessee is also required to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard asc 840 leases this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 however early adoption is permitted entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements cintas is currently evaluating the impact that asu 201602 will have on its consolidated financial statements the company currently expects the adoption of this standard to result in a material increase to the assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu 201609 is intended to simplify accounting for sharebased payments upon adoption asu 201609 requires excess tax benefits for sharebased payments to be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and reflected within operating cash flows rather than being recorded within equity and reflected within financing cash flows the standard also permits the repurchase of more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur this update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 however early adoption is permitted cintas adopted asu 201609 during the quarter ended august 31 2016 and elected to make an accounting policy change to recognize forfeitures as they occur the adoption impact on the consolidated balance sheet was a cumulativeeffect adjustment of 267 million  increasing opening retained earnings and decreasing paidin capital 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” asu 201704 eliminates the twostep process that required identification of potential impairment and a separate measure of the actual impairment goodwill impairment charges if any would be determined by the difference between a reporting units carrying value and its fair value impairment loss is limited to the carrying value this standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after december 15 2019 the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in march 2017 the fasb issued asu 201707 “improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs” asu 201707 continues to require the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs on the consolidated statement of income and changes the presentation of other components of net benefit cost so that these items will be presented outside of operating income within the consolidated statements of income cintas retrospectively adopted asu 201707 on june 1 2017 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 income statement  reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201802 allows entities to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings and requires additional related disclosures this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years cintas is currently evaluating the impact that asu 201802 will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements 

no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment is recognized when services are performed other revenue which is recorded in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segments and all other is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months uniforms acquired in the gk acquisition were amortized over 12 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and cintas specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate as a result of the identification of certain gk plants and branches for future closure an indicator of potential impairment was identified cintas recognized an impairment loss of 233 million  during the fiscal year ended may 31 2017 based on the excess of the carrying amount of asset over their respective fair values the undiscounted cash flows were estimated using level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches at the lowest discernible level which is at the location level cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended may 31 2018 and 2016  

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas reporting units via comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates we determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital which includes a calculation of cost of equity which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas a measure of systemic risk and cost of debt we also use comparable market earnings 

multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level cintas has identified four  reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment uniform rental and facility services first aid and safety services and two  reporting units within all other based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2018  2017  or 2016  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years the gk service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years  which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15year term certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2018  2017  or 2016  

business combinations 

accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income see note 9 entitled acquisitions and divestitures of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the gk acquisition 

general insurance liabilities 

general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred primarily related to workers compensation auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model generally measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 12 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 8 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would not be impacted because we had no variable rate debt as of may 31 2018 this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses including gk and zee may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business 

our outstanding indebtedness including indebtedness incurred to consummate the gk transaction may have negative consequences on our business such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions dividend increases stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions in addition it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

following the gk transaction more of our labor force is unionized while we believe that our employee relations are good we have been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost 

inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current us presidential administration and congress may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems including the systems inherited from gk are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions such as our current conversion to sap enterprise system power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls including those related to the acquired gk business we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

fiscal 2017  total revenue was 53 billion  an increase of 110  over the prior fiscal year revenue increased organically by 67 as a result of increased sales volume organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions divestitures workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations total revenue was positively impacted by 48 due to acquisitions primarily through the acquisition of gk revenue growth was negatively impacted by 01 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 04 due to one less workday in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  

organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below

selling and administrative expenses increased 1950 million  or 146  compared to fiscal 2016  due primarily to increases in labor and other employeepartner related expenses as a result of the acquisition of gk in fiscal 2017 the company incurred various transaction and integration expenses which relate primarily to asset impairment charges legal and professional fees employee termination expenses the writeoff of excess inventory and other miscellaneous expenses in fiscal 2017 gk transaction and integration expenses were 792 million or 15 of total revenue 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income was 863 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to 636 million  in fiscal 2016  the increase in net interest expense is primarily due to the additional debt issued to finance the gk acquisition and 171 million of shortterm debt financing fees incurred in connection with the acquisition 

income before income taxes was 6874 million  a decrease of 179 million  or 25  compared to fiscal 2016  the decrease in income before income taxes was due to the gk transaction and integration expenses and the increase in interest expense previously mentioned these impacts were partially offset by the increase in gross margin 

cintas effective tax rate on continuing operations was 335  for fiscal 2017  compared to 364  in fiscal 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of accounting standard update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 294 million as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 this benefit was partially offset by the election to recognize forfeitures as they occur which resulted in additional stock compensation expense of 83 million when compared to our historical practice of estimating forfeiture for expense purposes the adoption of asu 201609 also resulted in an increase in the effect of dilutive securities in fiscal 2017 of 08 million shares for fiscal 2017 the net impact on diluted earnings per share from the adoption of asu 201609 was an increase of 019 per share over what diluted earnings per share would have been if asu 201609 was not adopted in the current year

liquidity and capital resources 

the following is a summary of our cash flows and cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of and for the fiscal years ending may 31 



cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of may 31 2017  and 2016  include 1255 million and 965 million respectively that is located outside of the united states we expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock 

net cash provided by operating activities was 7639 million  for fiscal 2017  which was an increase of 2980 million  compared to fiscal 2016  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the 2295 million payment of taxes due on the gain on the sale of shredit

net cash provided by financing activities was 15785 million  for fiscal 2017 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 8667 million  for fiscal 2016  the increase from fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the net issuance of 17327 million of debt and the decrease in stock buybacks to finance the gk acquisition cintas issued various forms of debt totaling 20912 million net in addition on june 1 2016 cintas paid the 2500 million fiveyear senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper

on march 21 2017 the company completed the acquisition of gk to finance the gk acquisition cintas used a combination of new senior notes a term loan other borrowings under its existing credit facility and cash on hand 

the following table summarizes cintas outstanding debt at may 31

the credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended on september 16 2016 the amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 4500 million  to 6000 million  and added a 2500 million  term loan facility the 1500 million  increase in the revolving credit facility took effect upon the consummation of the merger merger contemplated by the merger agreement among the cintas gk and bravo merger sub inc merger sub a whollyowned subsidiary of cintas the term loan was funded upon the consummation of the merger the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to 2500 million  in the aggregate subject to customary conditions the maturity date of the agreement is september 15 2021 as of may 31 2017  there was 505 million  of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 124  and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility no  commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2016  

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit cintas ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the 

maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2017  our ratings were as follows 



  

in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

  

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

contractual obligations 



cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions are expected to be 517 million  in the next year 1112 million  in the next two to three years and 1226 million  in the next four to five years cintas may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements currently cintas does not expect to make any such payments during the next five years 



other commitments

no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment is recognized when services are performed other revenue which is recorded in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segments and all other is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months uniforms acquired in the gk acquisition will be amortized over 12 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and cintas specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate as a result of the identification of certain gk plants and branches for future closure an indicator of potential impairment was identified cintas recognized an impairment loss of 233 million  during the year ended may 31 2017 based on the excess of the carrying amount of asset over their respective fair values the undiscounted cash flows were estimated using level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches at the lowest discernible level which is at the location level cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the years ended may 31 2016  and 2015  

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas reporting units via comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates we determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital which includes a calculation of cost of equity which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas a measure of systemic risk and cost of debt we also use comparable market earnings 

multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as a result of cintas’ operating segment realignment in fiscal 2016 and the acquisition of gk in fiscal 2017 the composition of cintas’ reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment has changed cintas has identified six  reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment uniform rental and facility services gk services uniform rental and facility services first aid and safety services and three  reporting units within all other given the proximity of the gk acquisition date to the consolidated balance sheet date the company performed a high level qualitative analysis for its gk reporting unit which considered indicators of impairment to evaluate whether the fair value was morelikelythannot in excess of its carrying value the key indicators considered include macroeconomic conditions industrymarket considerations financial performance cash flow changes in management and composition of net assets based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2017  2016  or 2015  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years the gk service contract asset will be amortized over a period of 15 years  which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15year term certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2017  2016  or 2015  

business combinations 

accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income see note 9 entitled acquisitions and divestitures of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the gk and zee acquisitions 

general insurance liabilities 

general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred primarily related to workers compensation auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 12 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 8 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 11 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments periodically and when certain events occur as a result of a recent evaluation effective june 1 2015 cintas realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments in light of certain changes in its business including the acquisition of zee medical inc zee in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 cintas’ updated reportable operating segments are uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services the remainder of cintas’ business which consists primarily of fire protection services and its direct sale business is included in all other

we provide our products and services to over 900000 businesses of all types — from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth cintas total revenue and the revenue derived from each reportable operating segment and all other 



 additional information regarding each reportable operating segment and all other is also included in note 14 entitled operating segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas businesses are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our businesses 

within the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives in total cintas has approximately 9000 local delivery routes 377 operational facilities and eight  distribution centers at may 31 2016  cintas employed approximately 35000 employees of which approximately 200 were represented by labor unions

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of its costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 13 million in fiscal 2016  and approximately 12 million in fiscal 2015  capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances totaled approximately 3 million in fiscal 2016  and approximately 4 million in fiscal 2015  cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar words terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to our ability to promptly and effectively integrate acquisitions including zee our ability to realize any synergies from acquisitions including zee the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety the effect on operations of exchange fluctuations tariffs and other political economic and regulatory risks uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 costs of our sap system implementation disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data including cybersercurity risks the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise as required by law   the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits minimum wages labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor regulations regarding the classification of employees andor their eligibility for overtime wages higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products actions by energy producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

as a result of falling oil prices the financial performance of the fuel and energy industry has deteriorated and negatively impacted our business further decline and cutbacks within this industry could continue to adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas has been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of 

balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversionssuch as our current conversion to sap enterprise system power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to 

make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us gaap these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations

as of may 31 2016  we had 13000 million aggregate principal amount in fixed rate senior notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2036 these senior notes are comprised of 2500 million of 30year senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 at a rate of 615 3000 million of 10year senior notes issued in fiscal 2008 at a rate of 6125 2500 million of 5year senior notes issued in fiscal 2011 at a rate of 285 2500 million of 10year senior notes issued in 2011 at a rate of 430 and 2500 million of 10year senior notes issued in fiscal 2012 at a rate of 325 on june 1 2016 cintas paid the 2500 million 5year senior notes issued in fiscal 2011 with cash and 2185 million proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 

cintas commercial paper program has a capacity of 3000 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of 4500 million the revolving credit facility was amended on may 29 2014 to extend that maturity date from october 6 2016 to may 28 2019 to adjust the applicable margin used to calculate the interest payable on any outstanding loans and to adjust the facility fee payable under the agreement in june 2016 the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date from may 28 2019 to june 22 2021 increase the capacity to 4500 million  and add an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of 6000 million  we believe that this program along with cash generated from operations will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2016  or 2015  

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital as of may 31 2016  cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2016  our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

longterm contractual obligations 



cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions are expected to be 469 million in the next year 1009 million in the next two to three years and 1112 million in the next four to five years

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment is recognized when services are performed other revenue which is recorded in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segments and all other is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts this allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collections and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible the allowance that is an estimate based on the companys historical rates of collections is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business when an account is considered uncollectible it is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate 

investments 

investments consists primarily of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and equity method investments the equity method is used to account for an investment if our investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee in general equity method investments are initially measured at cost however an equity method investment resulting from a transaction in which a controlled group of assets that constitutes a business is deconsolidated is initially measured at fair value cintas recognizes its share of the investee’s earnings or losses in income cintas also adjusts its share of the investees earnings for intraentity 

transactions basis differences investee capital transactions and other comprehensive income through income or other comprehensive income as appropriate equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable 

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas reporting units via comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates we determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital which includes a calculation of cost of equity which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas a measure of systemic risk and cost of debt we also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as a result of cintas’ operating segment realignment the composition of cintas’ reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment has changed historically cintas’ reporting units were the same as the reportable operating segments rental uniforms and ancillary products uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services effective june 1 2015 cintas identified five  reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment uniform rental and facility services first aid and safety services and three  reporting units within all other as a result of the change in reporting units cintas was required to perform an interim impairment test on goodwill at june 1 2015 there was no impairment recorded as a result of the interim impairment test based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2016  2015  or 2014  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years or when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2016  2015  or 2014  

general insurance liabilities 

general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred primarily related to workers compensation auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 12 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 

significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 8 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 03 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 item 1 business 

cintas corporation cintas company we us or our a washington corporation provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types primarily throughout north america as well as latin america europe and asia cintas products and services are designed to enhance its customers images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and efficient workplace cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer currently the chairman emeritus of the board of directors when he left his familys industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business over the years cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers 

effective august 31 2014 cintas classifies its businesses into three  reportable operating segments operating segments based on the types of products and services provided the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services 

previously cintas classified its businesses into four  operating segments the document management services operating segment is no longer considered an operating segment this operating segment consisted of document destruction services shredding and document imaging and retention services storage on april 30 2014 cintas completed its partnership transaction with the shareholders of shredit international inc shredit to combine cintas shredding with shredits shredding business the shredding transaction due to the deconsolidation of shredding fiscal 2015 results exclude the results of shredding shredding remains reported in continuing operations for fiscal 2014 through april 30 2014 as previously discussed and 2013 based on the change in reportable operating segments the results of shredding for the year ended may 31 2014 are presented within corporate additionally effective august 31 2014 storage is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and has been excluded from continuing operations and from operating segment results for all periods presented in the quarter ended november 30 2014 cintas sold storage in a series of transactions storage transactions please see note 17 entitled discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on april 30 2014 the shredding transaction was completed cintas shredding represented approximately 76  80  and 70  of cintas document management services operating segments assets revenue and income before income taxes respectively as of and for the quarter ended february 28 2014 under the agreement cintas and shredit each contributed its shredding business to a newly formed partnership owned 42  by cintas and 58  by the shareholders of shredit the shredit partnership in addition to its 42  ownership of the shredit partnership cintas received 1800 million  in cash at the closing of the shredding transaction cintas equity interest in the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting as prescribed by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

we provide our products and services to over one million businesses of all types — from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth cintas total revenue and the revenue derived from each operating segment 



 additional information regarding each operating segment is also included in note 15 entitled operating segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives in total cintas has approximately 8000 local delivery routes 364 operational facilities and eight distribution centers at may 31 2015  cintas employed approximately 32000 employees of which approximately 200 were represented by labor unions 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates five manufacturing facilities that provide for standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of its costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 12 million in fiscal 2015  and approximately 21 million in fiscal 2014  capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances totaled approximately 4 million in fiscal 2015  and there were no capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

cintas uses its corporate website wwwcintascom as a channel for routine distribution of important information including news releases analyst presentations and financial information cintas files with or furnishes to the sec annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports as well as proxy statements and annual reports to shareholders and from time to time other documents the reports and other documents filed with or furnished to the sec are available to investors on or through our corporate website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the sec in addition the public may read and copy any of the materials we file with the sec at the secs public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 the public may obtain information on the operation of the facilities by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site located at wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers such as cintas that file electronically with the sec cintas sec filings and its code of business conduct can be found on the investor information page of its website at wwwcintascorpcomcompanyinvestorinformationhighlightsaspx these documents are available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy by writing or calling cintas as set forth on the investor information page the content on any website referred to in this annual report on form 10k is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k unless expressly noted 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar words terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the successful completion of the sale of cintas investment in the shredit partnership within the expected timeframe or at all the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety the effect on operations of exchange fluctuations tariffs and other political economic and regulatory risks uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data including cybersercurity risks the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service and the ultimate impact of the affordable care act cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise as required by law   the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas has been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches 

that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations

cintas commercial paper program has a capacity of 3000 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of 4500 million the revolving credit facility was amended on may 29 2014 to extend that maturity date from october 6 2016 to may 28 2019 to adjust the applicable margin used to calculate the interest payable on any outstanding loans and to adjust the facility fee payable under the agreement we believe that this program along with cash generated from operations will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2015  or 2014  

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital as of may 31 2015  cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2015  our ratings were as follows 



on june 26 2015 standard  poors rating agency raised its longterm credit rating for cintas to astable 

in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

longterm contractual obligations 



cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions are expected to be 419 million in the next year 903 million in the next two to three years and 995 million in the next four to five years

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment is recognized when services are performed other services revenue which is recorded in the uniform direct sales operating segment first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment shredding until april 30 2014 and the storage business that is reported as discontinued operations is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts this allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collections and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible the allowance that is an estimate based on the companys historical rates of collections is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each operating segment 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate 

investments 

investments consists primarily of cash surrender value of life insurance policies and equity method investments in general equity method investments are initially measured at cost however an equity method investment resulting from a transaction in which a controlled group of assets that constitutes a business is deconsolidated is initially measured at fair value cintas recognizes its share of the investee’s earnings or losses in income cintas also adjusts its share of the investees earnings for intraentity transactions basis differences investee capital transactions and other comprehensive income equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable 

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which for the company is at the operating segment level we determined that our reporting units are our rental uniforms and ancillary products uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas reporting units via comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2015  2014  or 2013  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years or when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2015  2014  or 2013  

general insurance liabilities 

general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred primarily related to workers compensation auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 12 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 8 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 03 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 additional information regarding each operating segment is also included in note 15 entitled operating segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives within the document management services operating segment cintas provides its services via local service routes originating from document retention facilities in total cintas has approximately 7800 local delivery routes 391 operational facilities and eight distribution centers at may 31 2014  cintas employed approximately 33000 employees of which approximately 200 were represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the shredit partnerships ability to promptly and effectively integrate the cintas document shredding business with shredits document shredding business the shredit partnerships ability to realize any synergies from the combination of the cintas document shredding business with shredits document shredding business the ability to successfully explore strategic opportunities for the cintas global document storage and imaging business the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service and the ultimate impact of the affordable care act cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise required by law  the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas has been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches 

that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

within our document management business we handle customers confidential information our failure to protect our customers confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our services involve the handling of our customers confidential information in both paper and electronic formats and the subsequent destruction or retention of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

we may encounter difficulties with the newlyformed partnership with shredit and could fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction 

on march 19 2014 we announced the contribution of our shredding business to the newly created partnership with shredit the transaction closed on april 30 2014 partnerships involve risks including difficulties in the combination of operations services and personnel and may divert management’s attention from business operations the inability of the partnership to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the entity to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated as result of the transaction could adversely impact the value of our investment the loss of revenue due to the creation of the partnership may have a dilutive impact that we may be unable to offset we may also incur unexpected costs including postclosing impairment charges litigation and other liabilities as a minority partner in the partnership our ability to influence our partner may be limited and nonalignment of interests on various strategic decisions in the partnership may adversely impact our business for example our partner may i have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours ii take actions contrary to our policies or objectives iii undergo a change of control iv experience financial and other difficulties or v be unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations under the agreements governing the partnership which may affect our financial condition or results of operations we may not be successful in managing the risks that we encounter in the creation of the partnership and these risks could materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations

liquidity and capital resources 

the following is a summary of our cash flows and cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of and for the fiscal years ending may 31 



cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of may 31 2014  and may 31 2013 include 402 million and 507 million that is located outside of the united states we expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6080 million  for fiscal 2014  an increase of 552 million  compared to fiscal 2013  along with the increase in net income cash flow was positively impacted by changes in uniforms and other rental items in service accrued compensation and related liabilities and accrued liabilities

we paid an annual cash dividend of 933 million  or 077 per share in december 2013 on a per share basis this dividend is an increase of 203 over the dividend paid in fiscal 2013 this marks the 31 st   consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend every year since going public in 1983 

as of may 31 2014  we had 13000 million aggregate principal amount in fixed rate senior notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2036 on june 1 2012 cintas repaid at maturity 2250 million aggregate principal amount of its 600 senior notes due 2012 on june 5 2012 cintas issued 2500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june 1 2022 these senior notes bear interest at a rate of 325 paid semiannually beginning december 1 2012 the net proceeds generated from the offering 250 million were used for general corporate purposes as of may 31 2014 we also had outstanding 2500 million of 30year senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 at a rate of 615 3000 million of 10year senior notes issued in fiscal 2008 at a rate of 6125 2500 million of 5year senior notes issued in fiscal 2011 at a rate of 285 and 2500 million of 10year senior notes issued in 2011 at a rate of 430 during fiscal 2014 cintas repaid a 75 million 5year loan that was issued in 2009 for funding the construction of a facility 

cintas commercial paper program has a capacity of 3000 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of 4500 million the revolving credit facility was amended on may 29 2014 to extend that maturity date from october 6 2016 to may 28 2019 to adjust the applicable margin used to calculate the interest payable on any outstanding loans and to adjust the facility fee payable under the agreement we believe that this program along with cash generated from operations will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2014  or 2013  

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital as of may 31 2014  cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2014  our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

longterm contractual obligations 



cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions are expected to be 414 million in the next year 883 million in the next two to three years and 962 million in the next four to five years

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost 

or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate 

investments 

investments consists primarily of cash surrender value of life insurance policies and equity method investments in general equity method investments are initially measured at cost however an equity method investment resulting from a transaction in which a controlled group of assets that constitutes a business is deconsolidated is initially measured at fair value cintas recognizes its share of the investee’s earnings or losses in income cintas also adjusts its share of the investees earnings for intraentity transactions basis differences investee capital transactions and other comprehensive income equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable 

goodwill 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas reporting units via comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2014  2013  or 2012  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2014  2013  or 2012  

stockbased compensation

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 8 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 02 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure

cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments based on the types of products and services provided the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document destruction document imaging and document retention services 

we provide our products and services to over one million businesses of all types — from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth cintas total revenue and the revenue derived from each operating segment 



additional information regarding each operating segment is also included in note 13 entitled operating segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives within the document management services operating segment cintas provides its services via local service routes originating from document management branches and document retention facilities in total cintas has approximately 8200 local delivery routes 446 operational facilities and eight distribution centers at may 31 2013  cintas employed approximately 32000 employees of which approximately 210 were represented by labor unions 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates five manufacturing facilities that provide for standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of its costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 19 million in fiscal 2013  and approximately 20 million in fiscal 2012  capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 2 million in fiscal 2013  and approximately 02 million in fiscal 2012  cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service and the ultimate impact of the affordable care act cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise required by law  the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including the cost to provide employeepartner related healthcare benefits labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles lower recycled paper prices the inability to obtain insurance coverage at costeffective rates higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and 

other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas has been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations including employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements citizenship requirements transportation and other laws and regulations in particular we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation or usdot and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs 

in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 12 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of computer systems or privacy breaches involving computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data if the network of security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company customer or employee information destruction or corruption of data security breaches or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

within our document management business we handle customers confidential information our failure to protect our customers confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our document management services business includes both document destruction and document retention services these services involve the handling of our customers confidential information in both paper and electronic formats and the subsequent destruction or retention of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations

fiscal 2013  total revenue was 43 billion an increase of 52 compared to fiscal 2012  the increase primarily resulted from an organic growth increase of 49 revenue in fiscal 2013  was negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday compared to fiscal 2012  the remaining 07 increase represents growth derived through acquisitions in our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment and our document management services operating segment during the year organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below organic growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays by quarter and for the year where applicable 



rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment increased 45 compared to fiscal 2012  the increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 49 this organic increase in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue was primarily due to improvements in sales representative productivity generally sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training which result in a higher number of products and services sold revenue in fiscal 2013  was negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday compared to fiscal 2012  

other services revenue consisting of revenue from the reportable operating segments of uniform direct sales first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services increased 69 compared to fiscal 2012  the increase primarily resulted from an organic growth increase of 49 which was due to improved sales representative productivity increased customer orders for uniforms and several large customer uniform rollouts slightly offset by a decrease in the average selling price of recycled paper revenue increased 24 as a result of growth derived through acquisitions in our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment and our document management services operating segment during fiscal 2013  revenue in fiscal 2013  was negatively impacted by 04 due to one less workday compared to fiscal 2012

operating income of 5652 million in fiscal 2013  increased 256 million or 47 compared to fiscal 2012  this increase was primarily due to increased revenue in fiscal 2013  improved capacity utilization and revenue growing at a faster rate than the selling and administrative expenses 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income decreased 34 million from fiscal 2012  this decrease was due to the maturity of the 2250 million aggregate principal amount of 60 senior notes on june 1 2012 offset by the issuance of 2500 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2022 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

the following is a summary of our cash flows and cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of and for the fiscal years ending may 31 



the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of may 31 2013  include 507 million that is located outside of the united states we expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities the marketable securities at may 31 2013  consist of united states municipal bonds we believe that our investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative the primary criterion used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5527 million for fiscal 2013  an increase of 829 million compared to fiscal 2012  along with the increase in net income the decrease in inventory and the increase in accounts payable also had a positive impact on cash flows

we paid an annual cash dividend of 797 million or 064 per share in december 2012 on a per share basis this dividend is an increase of 185 over the dividend paid in fiscal 2012 this marks the 30 th   consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend every year since going public in 1983 

as of may 31 2013  we had 13000 million aggregate principal amount in fixed rate senior notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2036 on june 1 2012 cintas repaid at maturity 2250 million aggregate principal amount of its 600 senior notes due 2012 on june 5 2012 cintas issued 2500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june 1 2022 these senior notes bear interest at a rate of 325 paid semiannually beginning december 1 2012 the net proceeds generated from the offering 250 million were used for general corporate purposes as of may 31 2013 we also had outstanding 2500 million of 30year senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 at a rate of 615 3000 million of 10year senior notes issued in fiscal 2008 at a rate of 6125 2500 million of 5year senior notes issued in fiscal 2011 at a rate of 285 and 2500 million of 10year senior notes issued in 2011 at a rate of 430 during fiscal 2009 cintas initiated a 75 million loan with pidc regional center lp for funding related to a facility being built in philadelphia it is a 5year note with a 275 interest rate due in fiscal 2014 

cintas commercial paper program has a capacity of 3000 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of 4500 million the revolving credit facility was amended on october 7 2011 to extend the maturity date from september 26 2014 to october 6 2016 to improve the applicable margin used to calculate the interest rate payable on any outstanding loans and the facility fee payable under the agreement and to replace the financial covenant regarding cintas net funded indebtedness to total capitalization with a requirement to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization debt to ebitda of no more than 35 to 10 we believe this program along with cash generated from operations will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2013  or 2012  

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital as of may 31 2013  cintas was in compliance with all significant debt covenants 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2013  our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

longterm contractual obligations 



cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions are expected to increase approximately 3 to 5 annually based on that increase payments due in one year or less would be 306 million two to three years would be 659 million and four to five years would be 727 million payments for years thereafter are expected to continue increasing by approximately 5 each year

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 60 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate longlived assets that are held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which includes the determination of the estimated fair value of its reporting units this test includes comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates the methodology used is consistent with prior years based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2013  2012  or 2011  cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist if any are noted 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2013  2012  or 2011

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 7 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized

earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 01 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 item 1 business 

cintas corporation cintas company we us or our a washington corporation provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types primarily throughout north america as well as latin america europe and asia cintas products and services are designed to enhance its customers images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and efficient work place cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer currently the chairman emeritus of the board of directors when he left his familys industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business over the years cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers 

cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments based on the types of products and services provided the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document destruction document imaging and document retention services 

we provide our products and services to over 900000 businesses of all types — from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth cintas total revenue and the revenue derived from each operating segment 



additional information regarding each operating segment is also included in note 13 entitled operating segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives within the document management services operating segment cintas provides its services via local service routes originating from document management branches and document retention facilities in total cintas has approximately 7800 local delivery routes 429 operational facilities and eight distribution centers at may 31 2012  cintas employed approximately 30000 employees of which approximately 210 were represented by labor unions 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates six manufacturing facilities that provide for standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of its costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 20 million in fiscal 2012  and 18 million in fiscal 2011  capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 02 million in fiscal 2012  and approximately 2 million in fiscal 2011  cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

cintas uses its corporate website wwwcintascom as a channel for routine distribution of important information including news releases analyst presentations and financial information cintas files with or furnishes to the sec annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports as well as proxy statements and annual reports to shareholders and from time to time other documents the reports and other documents filed with or furnished to the sec are available to investors on or through our corporate website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the sec in addition the public may read and copy any of the materials we file with the sec at the secs public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site located at httpwwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers such as cintas that file electronically with the sec cintas sec filings and its code of business conduct can be found on the investor information page of its website at wwwcintascomcompanyinvestorinformationhighlightsaspx these documents are available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy by writing or calling cintas as set forth on the investor information page the content on any website referred to in this annual report on form 10k is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k unless expressly noted 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 disruptions caused by the unaccessibility of computer systems data the initiation or outcome of litigation investigations or other proceedings higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock if any changes in federal and state tax and labor laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forwardlooking statements or to otherwise update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made except otherwise required by law 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles lower recycled paper prices higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt its results of operations cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to us these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas has been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar british pound and the euro in fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operations 

the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated by osha and various record keeping disclosure and procedural requirements various osha standards may apply to our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities and payment of damages to private litigants and affect our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our 

consolidated results of operations 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 12 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under applicable environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions power outages computer or telecommunication failures catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees in addition cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and therefore could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial 

reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

within our document management business we handle customers confidential information our failure to protect our customers confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our document management services business includes both document destruction and document retention services these services involve the handling of our customers confidential information and the subsequent destruction or retention of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations

liquidity and capital resources

the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of may 31 2012  include 518 million that is located outside of the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 cintas repatriated approximately 110 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries we expect to use the remaining amounts located outside of the us to fund our international operations and international expansion activities no marketable securities were outstanding at may 31 2012  we believe that our investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative the primary criterion used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield 

cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we generally use these cash flows to fund most if not all of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities as well as proceeds from longterm debt and shortterm borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4699 million for fiscal 2012  an increase of 1290 million compared to fiscal 2011  along with the increase in net income the decrease in inventory during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 also had a positive impact on our operating cash flow in addition although accounts receivable increased on increased revenue the average accounts receivable collection period at may 31 2012  improved to 40 days compared to 42 days at may 31 2011

cintas commercial paper program has a capacity of 3000 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of 4500 million the revolving credit facility was amended on october 7 2011 to extend the maturity date from september 26 2014 to october 6 2016 to improve the applicable margin used to calculate the interest rate payable on any outstanding loans and the facility fee payable under the agreement and to replace the financial covenant regarding cintas net funded indebtedness to total capitalization with a requirement to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization debt to ebitda of no more than 35 to 10 we believe this program along with cash generated from operations will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31 2012  or 2011  

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens to engage in saleleaseback transactions and to merge consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios crossdefault provisions exist between certain debt instruments if a default of a significant covenant were to occur the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital as of may 31 2012  cintas was in compliance with all significant debt covenants 

our access to the commercial paper and longterm debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of may 31 2012  our ratings were as follows 



in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding longterm debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and longterm debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at 

any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year longterm debt and longterm obligations under capital leases 

contractual obligations 



cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas future contributions are expected to increase approximately 3 to 5 annually based on that increase payments due in one year or less would be 280 million two to three years would be 604 million and four to five years would be 666 million payments for years thereafter are expected to continue increasing by approximately 5 each year

in september 2011 the fasb issued new guidance with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test which adds a qualitative assessment that allows companies to determine whether they need to perform the twostep impairment test the objective of the guidance is to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment and more specifically to reduce the cost and complexity of performing the goodwill impairment test the guidance may change how the goodwill impairment test is performed but should not change the timing or measurement of goodwill impairments the qualitative screen is effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted for all companies cintas will consider the new guidance in performing its annual goodwill impairment test however it was not early adopted in fiscal 2012

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on the companys historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats mops cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 48 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate longlived assets that are held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which includes the determination of the estimated fair value of its reporting units this test includes comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth as well as discount rates the methodology used is consistent with prior years based on the results of the annual impairment tests cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2012  2011  or 2010

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2012  2011  or 2010  

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options and restricted stock awards in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 11 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed in note 12 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 7 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets as adjusted for valuation allowances will be realized 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 05 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments and the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 item 1 business 

cintas corporation cintas a washington corporation provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types primarily throughout north america and latin america europe and asia cintas products and services are designed to enhance its customers images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and efficient work place cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer currently the chairman emeritus of the board when he left his familys industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business over the years cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers 

cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document destruction document imaging and document retention services 

we provide our products and services to approximately 800000 businesses of all types — from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth cintas total revenue and the revenue derived from each operating segment 



additional information is also included in note 14 entitled operating segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives within the document management services operating segment cintas provides its services via local service routes originating from document management branches and document retention facilities in total cintas has approximately 7700 local delivery routes 418 operations and 8 distribution centers at may 31 2010 cintas employed approximately 30000 employees of which approximately 225 were represented by labor unions 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates 6 manufacturing facilities which provide for standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 18 million in fiscal 2010 and approximately 19 million in fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were less than 1 million in fiscal 2010 and approximately 2 million in fiscal 2009 cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and 

similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings fluctuations in foreign currency exchange the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation asset impairment charges the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 disruptions caused by the unaccessibility of computer systems data the initiation or outcome of litigation higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic events changes in federal and state tax and labor laws the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service and other factors set forth in this item 1a risk factors section cintas undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance negative economic conditions in north america and our other markets may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles lower recycled paper prices higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operation 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt our results of operation cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to cintas these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and results of operation 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operation historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for 

acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our results of operation 

increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns future increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operation cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by several unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operation 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operation the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition us and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operation 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar and the euro in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of 

balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operation the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated by osha and various record keeping disclosure and procedural requirements various osha standards may apply to our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities and payment of damages to private litigants and affect our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our results of operation 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our financial condition and results of operation 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operation our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operation in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while cintas regularly engages in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and results of operation our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses we have an active disaster recovery plan in 

place that is frequently reviewed and tested however our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions power outages computer or telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may have interruptions in our ability to service our customers this disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales and results of operation 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operation unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our results of operation these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

we may recognize impairment charges which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their fair values the fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

within our document management business we handle customers confidential information our failure to protect our customers confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operation our document management services business includes both document destruction and document retention services these services involve the handling of our customers confidential information and the subsequent destruction or retention of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operation 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operation our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operation and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our results of operation

we are north americas leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs as well as a significant provider of related business services including entrance mats restroom cleaning services and supplies carpet and tile cleaning services first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products 

cintas principal objective is to exceed customers expectations in order to maximize the longterm value of cintas for shareholders and working partners and it provides the framework and focus for our business strategy this strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which cintas has not historically served we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers 

to pursue the strategy of increasing penetration we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis this frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships the combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services 

we pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect we also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion especially in our emerging businesses of first aid and safety fire protection and document management finally we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise 

results of operation 

the economic downturn that occurred in fiscal 2009 continued throughout most of our fiscal 2010 the us economy which lost millions of jobs in our fiscal 2009 continued to lose jobs through the first three quarters of our fiscal 2010 these job losses directly affected our business as many of our products and services are dependent on customer employee levels we were encouraged though that the rate of us job loss lessened as we progressed through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 and us employment levels slightly increased in our fourth fiscal 2010 quarter as this stabilization occurred in the general us economic environment our internal growth rate improved 

internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays by quarter and for the year where applicable 



despite the lower revenue level for the year we were able to generate improved cash flow with net cash provided by operating activities of 5616 million representing a 73 increase compared to fiscal 2009 we also increased the dividend paid to shareholders to 048 per share marking the 27 th consecutive increase in the dividend paid 

cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document destruction document imaging and document retention services 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent to revenue by operating segment and in total for the fiscal years ended may 31 



fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

the economic environment in fiscal 2009 presented challenges not experienced in decades the financial crisis which began in september 2008 caused many of our customers to immediately reduce spending as the economic turmoil continued we saw our customers make dramatic reductions in spending significant job losses in north america followed the financial crisis as these economies lost millions of jobs from october 2008 through may 2009 

the suddenness and severity of the economic downturn required us to react quickly to reduce our cost structure beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we closed two manufacturing plants in kentucky initiated hiring and wage freezes in many parts of the organization eliminated many overhead positions and reduced discretionary and capital spending these initiatives resulted in a reduction to selling and administrative expenses of approximately 60 million when comparing the last six months of fiscal 2009 to the first six months of fiscal 2009 

in addition to the actions described above we initiated restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce excess capacity and further reduce our cost structure these activities included closing or converting to branches 16 of our rental processing plants and reducing our workforce by 1200 employees these restructuring activities were substantially completed in fiscal 2010 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded charges of 489 million in longlived asset impairment costs 79 million in employee termination costs and 23 million in other exit costs for a total of 591 million that will be incurred as a result of this restructuring the following summarizes these amounts by operating segment

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment is recognized when services are performed other services revenue which is recorded in the uniform direct sales first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts this allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collectability and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible the allowance that is an estimate based on historical rates of collectability is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the three other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each operating segment 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 48 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate longlived assets that are held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs to sell 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas completes an annual impairment test which includes the determination of the fair value of its reporting units this test includes comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth the methodology used is consistent with prior years based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2010 2009 or 2008 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2010 2009 or 2008 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award see note 12 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 8 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 15 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments and the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue 

and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 item 1 business 

cintas corporation cintas a washington corporation provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types primarily throughout the united states and canada cintas products and services are designed to enhance its customers images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and efficient work place cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer chairman of the board when he left his familys industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business over the years cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers 

cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom and hygiene products and services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document destruction document imaging and document retention services 

we provide our products and services to approximately 800000 businesses of all types — from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

the following table sets forth the revenue derived from each operating segment provided by cintas 



additional information is also included in note 15 entitled operating segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives within the document management services operating segment cintas provides its services via local service routes originating from document management branches and document retention facilities in total cintas has approximately 7900 local delivery routes 411 operations and 8 distribution centers at may 31 2009 cintas employed approximately 31000 employees of which approximately 300 were represented by labor unions 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates 6 manufacturing facilities which provide for standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 19 million in fiscal 2009 and approximately 17 million in fiscal 2008 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 2 million in fiscal 2009 and approximately 4 million in fiscal 2008 cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

cintas files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission sec the public may copy these materials at the secs public reference room at 100 f street ne room 1580 washington dc 20549 and may obtain further information concerning the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 800 sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains the same information regarding cintas that is filed electronically with the sec the address of that site is httpwwwsecgov cintas annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as posted on its website wwwcintascom as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing with the sec the information on cintas website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions risks or uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as estimates anticipates predicts projects plans expects intends target forecast believes seeks could should may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or 

implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings fluctuations in foreign currency exchange the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation asset impairment charges the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the initiation or outcome of litigation higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic events changes in federal and state tax and labor laws the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service and other factors set forth in this item 1a risk factors section cintas undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made 

negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance negative economic conditions in north america and globally may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles lower recycled paper prices higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operation 

the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operation our operating cash flows combined with access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity however deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity andor increase our cost of borrowing in addition credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operation and financial condition along with deterioration in general economic conditions may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings which could increase our cost of borrowing increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our results of operation 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including the canadian dollar and the euro in fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented less than 10 of our consolidated revenue because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies this impact could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if 

existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt our results of operation cintas competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to cintas these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and results of operation 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operation the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition united states and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operation 

increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns the increases in oil prices during 2008 which moderated in late 2008 and 2009 resulted in significantly higher fuel costs to cintas similar increases in the future in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operation cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by several unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operation 

within our document management business we handle customers confidential information our failure to protect our customers confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operation our document management services business includes both document destruction and document retention services these services involve the handling of our customers confidential information and the subsequent destruction or retention of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operation 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operation our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operation in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while cintas regularly engages in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 14 entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability and expense material to our financial condition and results of operation 

failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operation the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or osha establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated by osha and various record keeping disclosure and procedural requirements various osha standards may apply to our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants and affect our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our results of operation 

risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operation historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managements attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our results of operation 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operation unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our businesses could adversely affect our results of operation these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

deterioration in general economic conditions primarily in north america may result in the recognition of impairment charges which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our longlived assets for impairment when required by us generally accepted accounting principles these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their fair values the fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow reductions in managements estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital and deteriorating real estate values if our assessment of goodwill other intangible assets or longlived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge this may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable 

financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

results of operation 

the economic environment in fiscal 2009 presented challenges not experienced in decades the financial crisis which began in september 2008 caused many of our customers to immediately reduce spending as the economic turmoil continued we saw our customers make dramatic reductions in spending significant job losses in the us and canada followed the financial crisis as these economies lost millions of jobs from october 2008 through may 2009 

the suddenness and severity of the economic downturn required us to react quickly to reduce our cost structure beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we closed two manufacturing plants in kentucky initiated hiring and wage freezes in many parts of the organization eliminated many overhead positions and reduced discretionary and capital spending these initiatives resulted in a reduction to selling and administrative expenses of approximately 60 million when comparing the last six months of fiscal 2009 to the first six months of fiscal 2009 

in addition to the actions described above we initiated restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce excess capacity and further reduce our cost structure these activities included closing or converting to branches 16 of our rental processing plants and reducing our workforce by 1200 employees we 

expect these restructuring activities to be completed by may 31 2010 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded charges of 489 million in longlived asset impairment costs 79 million in employee termination costs and 23 million in other exit costs for a total of 591 million that will be incurred as a result of this restructuring the following summarizes these amounts by operating segment 



a progression of our restructuring liability balance primarily recorded in accrued compensation and related liabilities at may 31 2009 is as follows 



the restructuring activities are more fully described in note 2 entitled restructuring and related activity of notes to consolidated financial statements 

despite the economic turmoil during fiscal 2009 we were still able to generate strong operating cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was 5235 million we reduced capital and acquisition spending by 1109 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 we were able to pay down 1571 million in net borrowings during fiscal 2009 resulting in no outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of may 31 2009 additionally we were still able to pay shareholders an increased dividend of 047 per share 

cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom and hygiene products and services are also provided within this operating segment the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document destruction document imaging and document retention services 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by operating segment and in total for the periods indicated 



the reduction in uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2009 reflects the significant reduction in spending by customers of these businesses during the economic turmoil in fiscal 2009 despite a significant decrease in the price of recycled paper prices during fiscal 2009 document management services revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue over the last two fiscal years as a result of acquisitions and internal growth in our destruction services 

cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to lower revenue levels in all operating segments other than document management services the significant deterioration of the us and canadian economies particularly in the last five months of the year ended may 31 2009 which led to reduced revenue levels in our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment our uniform direct sales operating segment and our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment created excess inventory levels in these operating segments as a result we reduced the carrying amount of specific inventory to 

realizable values and recorded a pretax loss in the year ended may 31 2009 of 275 million the following summarizes this loss by operating segment 



cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in document management services increased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of a significant decrease in the price of recycled paper this operating segment derives revenue from the sale of shredded paper to paper recyclers the weighted average price of standard office paper which accounts for the majority of the recycled paper revenue dropped by 242 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008

cintas has no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the synthetic lease on a corporate aircraft the synthetic lease on the aircraft does not currently have and is not reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on cintas financial condition changes in cintas financial condition revenue or expenses results of operation liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation and changing prices 

changes in wages benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas financial results medical benefit costs increased as a percent to revenue due to increased utilization and rising healthcare industry costs medical benefits were 35 of total revenue in fiscal 2009 and 31 of total revenue in fiscal 2008 management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas financial condition or a negative impact on results of operation 

litigation and other contingencies 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operation of cintas cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business please refer to part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 14 entitled litigation and other contingencies of part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of certain specific litigation 

new accounting standards 

effective june 1 2008 cintas adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 157 fair value measurements fas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements fasb staff position 1572 delayed the effective date of fas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities fas 157 is effective for cintas beginning june 1 2009 the adoption of fas 157 for our financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on cintas results of operation or financial condition cintas adoption of fas 157 is more fully described in note 3 entitled fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements cintas does not believe that the adoption of fas 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities will materially impact its financial position and results of operation 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 revised 2007 business combinations fas 141r under fas 141r an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date it further requires that acquisitionrelated costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense for cintas fas 141r is effective for acquisitions and adjustments to an acquired entitys deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after may 31 2009 the adoption of fas 141r will have an impact on cintas consolidated financial statements when effective but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment is recognized when services are performed other services revenue which is recorded in the uniform direct sales first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts this allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collectability and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible the allowance that is an estimate based on historical rates of collectability is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the three other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each operating segment 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market substantially all inventories represent finished goods cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence the significant deterioration of the us and canadian economies particularly in the last five months of the year ended may 31 2009 led to reduced revenue in our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment our uniform direct sales operating segment and our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment which created excess inventory amounts in these operating segments as a result we reduced the carrying amount of specific inventory to realizable values and recorded a pretax loss in the year ended may 31 2009 of 275 million the following summarizes this amount by operating segment 



uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life 

of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant clothing linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 48 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets as appropriate longlived assets that are held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs to sell see note 2 entitled restructuring and related activity of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairment of longlived assets 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas performs annual impairment tests by operating segment these tests include comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31 2009 2008 or 2007 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31 2009 2008 or 2007 

stockbased compensation 

as required under fasb statement no 123r sharebased payment compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award 

see note 13 entitled stockbased compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine 

the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities see note 9 entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper if shortterm rates changed by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 05 million this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments and the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10 of cintas consolidated revenue and profit cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar

 item 1 business 

cintas corporation cintas a washington corporation provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types throughout the united states and canada cintas’ products and services are designed to enhance its customers’ images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and efficient work place cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer chairman of the board when he left his family’s industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970’s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business over the years cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers 

the products and services provided by cintas are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide our products and services to approximately 800000 businesses of all types – from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas’ total revenue as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

cintas historically classified its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services the rentals operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments mats mops and shop towels and other ancillary items in addition to these rental items restroom and hygiene products and services are also provided within this operating segment effective june 1 2007 this operating segment has been renamed rental uniforms and ancillary products 

the other services operating segment historically consisted of the direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products effective june 1 2007 the other services operating segment was separated into three reportable operating segments – uniform direct sales operating segment first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment and document management services operating segment this change provides more visibility to these operating segments as they continue to grow and have a larger impact on cintas’ consolidated results of operations the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document shredding and document storage services 

 

 

 

  

  

the following table sets forth the revenue derived from each operating segment provided by cintas fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 have been restated to reflect the change to the reportable operating segments made effective june 1 2007 

 

additional information is also included in note 13 entitled segment information in “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

the primary markets served by all cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas’ local operations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments 

within the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the uniform direct sales and first aid safety and fire protection services operating segments cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives within the document management services operating segment cintas provides its services via local service routes originating from document management branches and document storage facilities in total cintas has approximately 8400 local delivery routes 405 operations and 8 distribution centers at may 31 2008 cintas employed approximately 34000 employees of which approximately 400 were represented by labor unions 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates 10 manufacturing facilities which provide for standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 17 million in fiscal 2008 and approximately 16 million in fiscal 2007 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 4 million in fiscal 2008 and approximately 2 million in fiscal 2007 cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

cintas files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission sec the public may copy these materials at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne room 1580 washington dc 20549 and may obtain further information concerning the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 800 sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains the same information regarding cintas that is filed electronically with the sec the address of that site is httpwwwsecgov cintas’ annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as posted on its website wwwcintascom as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing with the sec the information on cintas’ website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions risks or uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates” “anticipates” “predicts” “projects” “plans” “expects” “intends” “target” “forecast” “believes” “seeks” “could” “should” “may” and “will” or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy costs lower sales volumes loss of customers due to outsourcing trends the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the initiation or outcome of litigation higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic events changes in federal and state tax and labor laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made 

 

general economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions in north america and globally may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas’ products and services increases in labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles lower recycled paper prices higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses as a result these factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operation 

 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt our results of operations cintas’ competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to cintas these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and 

  

  

environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition united states and foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

further increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns limits on refining capacities natural disasters and environmental concerns recent oil price increases have adversely affected our operating expense any further increase in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by several unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

 

within our document management business we handle customers’ confidential information our failure to protect our customers’ confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our document management business includes both document shredding and document storage services these services involve the handling of our customers’ confidential information and the subsequent shredding or storage of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate 

  

  

reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operation in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while cintas regularly engages in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 12 entitled litigation and other contingencies of “notes to consolidated financial statements” certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial condition and results of operations 

 

failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operations 

the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or “osha” establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration and various record keeping disclosure and procedural requirements various osha standards may apply to our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations the failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants and affect our ability to service our customers 

 

risks associated with our acquisition policy could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our business 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our business could adversely affect our results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

  

  

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

results of operations 

fiscal 2008 marked the 39 th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas this milestone was achieved despite challenging economic conditions including significant increases in energy costs additionally we increased our dividends paid to shareholders by 179 

cintas historically classified its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services the rentals operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments mats mops and shop towels in addition to these rental items restroom and hygiene products and services are also provided within this operating segment effective june 1 2007 this operating segment was renamed rental uniforms and ancillary products 

the other services operating segment historically consisted of the direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products effective june 1 2007 the other services operating segment was separated into three reportable operating segments – uniform direct sales operating segment first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment and document management services operating segment this change provides more visibility to these operating segments as they continue to grow and have a larger impact on cintas’ consolidated results the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid safety and fire protection products and services the document management services operating segment consists of document shredding and document storage services revenue and income before income taxes for each of these operating segments for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are presented in note 13 entitled segment information of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

  

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by operating segment and in total for the periods indicated fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 amounts have been restated to reflect the change to the reportable operating segments made effective june 1 2007 

 

 

as shown above our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment revenue and document management services operating segment revenue have grown as a percentage of our total revenue over the last two fiscal years this shift was driven by acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in addition the continued development of our sales efforts in the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment and the document management services operating segment have contributed to higher revenue growth in these two operating segments compared to the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the uniform direct sales operating segment 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased over the last two fiscal years primarily due to a reorganization of our sales efforts which began in fiscal 2007 the financial impact of this reorganization effort continued into fiscal 2008 the reorganization has been completed and we expect to see improved leverage in fiscal 2009 

 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2008 total revenue was 39 billion an increase of 62 over fiscal 2007 internal growth was 46 in fiscal 2008 compared to 53 in fiscal 2007 the deterioration in the north american economy created a challenging environment throughout fiscal 2008 the rising unemployment in the us put pressure on our ability to grow rental uniform wearers particularly in the latter half of fiscal 2008 as many of our customers reduced their workforces in addition our fire protection services business within the first aid safety and fire protection 

  

  

services operating segment suffered due to pressure on fire installation system revenue and lower than anticipated recurring service revenue our internal growth was generated primarily through the sale of document management services to new and existing customers continued penetration of our ancillary products and services such as mats hygiene supplies and restroom cleaning services to existing customers and first aid and safety products and services to new and existing customers the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment increased 37 over fiscal 2007 internal growth for the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment was 34 in fiscal 2008 the increase in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained the main driver of our internal growth as we continued to sell rental programs to new customers we also continued to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs the remaining growth of 03 in fiscal 2008 resulted from the acquisition of rental businesses 

other services revenue consisting of revenue from the reportable operating segments of uniform direct sales first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services increased 135 over fiscal 2007 internal growth accounted for 82 of this increase this internal growth was generated primarily through the increased sales of first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services to customers the remaining revenue growth of 53 was generated through a combination of acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 

cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increased 44 over fiscal 2007 cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by the growth in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue in addition rising energy costs especially in the second half of the fiscal year contributed to this increase energy costs increased 111 in fiscal 2008 from 1046 million in fiscal 2007 to 1162 million in fiscal 2008 

cost of other services increased 105 over fiscal 2007 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the uniform direct sales operating segment the first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment and the document management services operating segment the increase over fiscal 2007 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions rising energy costs also impacted the cost of other services other services energy costs increased 354 from 181 million in fiscal 2007 to 245 million in fiscal 2008 improved leverage and various cost containment programs in our uniform direct sales first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments helped to partially offset the increases in energy costs 

selling and administrative expenses increased 100 over fiscal 2007 selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses in fiscal 2007 we reorganized our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive in the longterm this reorganization as well as increased marketing plans and sales promotions combined to increase our selling costs by 531 million over the prior fiscal year in addition administrative expenses increased by 104 million due to an increase in legal and other professional services 

operating income of 5775 million in fiscal 2008 was relatively flat over fiscal 2007 gross margin increased by 1002 million but was offset by the increase of 1002 million in selling and administrative expenses 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased 29 million from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily a result of increased interest expense from additional debt added in fiscal 2008 used to buyback shares under our share buyback program 

income before income tax was 5307 million a 05 decrease over fiscal 2007 this change reflects the relatively flat operating income being reduced by the higher net interest expense 

  

  

cintas effective tax rate was 368 for fiscal 2008 as compared to 373 for fiscal 2007 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

net income for fiscal 2008 of 3354 million was a 03 increase over fiscal 2007 and diluted earnings per share of 215 was a 29 increase over fiscal 2007 the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the impact of the share buyback program which is discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below

marketable securities consist primarily of canadian federal government securities cintas investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative the criterion used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield 

accounts receivable increased 212 million primarily due to increased revenue the average collection period in fiscal 2008 remained comparable with fiscal 2007 

inventories increased 69 million or 30 primarily due to inventory requirements for the rollout of our direct sale catalog and for the opening of a new facility services distribution center this new distribution center is designed to improve logistics and enhance the cost structure of our ancillary products within our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment 

working capital increased 1614 million to 9151 million in fiscal 2008 this increase is primarily due to an increase in accounts payable due to a reclassification of cash and accounts payable as described above 

net property and equipment increased by 543 million due to continued investment in rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection and document management businesses capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 totaled 1903 million including 1408 million for the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and 310 million for the document management services operating segment exceeding depreciation expense by approximately 

  

  

418 million cintas continues to reinvest in land buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth during fiscal 2008 cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and one new distribution center and has an additional five uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 will be between 1800 million and 2000 million 

longterm debt totaled 9427 million at may 31 2008 this amount includes 2250 million of 10year senior notes at a rate of 60 issued in fiscal 2002 2500 million of 30year senior notes issued in august 2006 at a rate of 615 and 3000 million of 10year senior notes issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 at a rate of 6125 proceeds from issuances of the august 2006 30year senior notes and the fiscal 2008 third quarter 10year senior notes were both used to extinguish outstanding commercial paper at the time of their respective debt issuances cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of “a” from standard  poor’s and “a2” from moody’s in addition longterm debt also includes 1630 million in commercial paper cintas utilizes a 6000 million commercial paper program on which it has earned credit ratings of “a1” from standard  poor’s and “prime1” from moody’s we believe these ratings are reflective of our commitment to conservative financial policies strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions the commercial paper program is fully supported by a longterm credit facility that matures in fiscal 2011 

cintas’ total debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 289 at may 31 2007 to 295 at may 31 2008 total debt increased 626 million in fiscal 2008 through the net activity of the debt issuance noted above see note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements” this additional indebtedness was used to execute the share buyback program during fiscal 2008 cintas bought back 1915 million of cintas common stock 

during fiscal 2008 cintas paid dividends of 708 million or 046 per share on a per share basis this dividend is an increase of 179 over the dividend paid in fiscal 2007 this marks the 25 th consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend every year since going public in 1983

other commitments 

 

 

 

cintas has no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the synthetic lease on a corporate aircraft the synthetic lease on the aircraft does not currently have and is not reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on cintas’ financial condition changes in cintas’ financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation and changing prices 

changes in wages benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas’ financial results energy costs in particular continue to rise energy costs were 36 of total revenue in fiscal 2008 and 33 of total revenue in fiscal 2007 medical benefit costs have decreased as a percent to revenue due to better claims experience and a onetime benefit from a switch to a new provider medical benefits were 31 of total revenue in fiscal 2008 and 34 of total revenue in fiscal 2007 although difficult to predict we do not expect that medical benefit expense will continue to decrease management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas financial condition or a negative impact on operations

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 17 million in fiscal 2008 and approximately 16 million in fiscal 2007 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 4 million in fiscal 2008 and approximately 2 million in fiscal 2007 cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

 

new accounting standards 

as of june 1 2007 cintas adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fas 109 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas 109 accounting for income taxes  fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition as a result of the implementation of fin 48 cintas recorded a decrease to retained earnings as of june 1 2007 of 13731 cintas’ adoption of fin 48 is more fully described in note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements fas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements cintas will adopt fas 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 in february 2008 the fasb released a fasb staff position fsp fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 which delayed the effective date of fas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the adoption of fas 157 for our financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact upon adoption 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 revised 2007 business combinations fas 141r under fas 141r an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date it further requires that acquisitionrelated costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred restructuring costs generally are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense for cintas fas 141r is effective for acquisitions and adjustments to an acquired entity’s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after may 31 2009 cintas is currently evaluating the future impact and disclosures under fas 141r 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of “notes to consolidated financial statements” significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue which is recorded in the rentals uniforms and ancillary products operating segment is recognized when services are performed other services revenue which is recorded in the uniform direct sales first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the three other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each segment 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market substantially all inventories represent finished goods cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of 18 months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant garments linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 48 months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings 5 to 20 years for building improvements 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 5 years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate longlived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs related to disposition 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas performs annual impairment tests by operating segment these tests include comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may 31 2008 2007 or 2006 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally 5 to 10 years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may 31 2008 2007 or 2006 

  

  

stockbased compensation 

as required under fasb statement no 123r sharebased payment compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased payments to employees including stock options in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model measured compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related sharebased compensation award 

see note 11 entitled stockbased compensation of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities please reference note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

outlook 

while it is our view that economic conditions will remain sluggish we believe we can achieve continued growth in sales and profits we will pursue our strategy of achieving revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments and markets to which cintas has not historically served when appropriate opportunities arise we will also supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 

we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our employeepartners and supported by our infrastructure quality products financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success as such we see upside revenue potential for all of our business units however we do not expect that economic and competitive pressures will diminish and these pressures will continue creating a difficult pricing environment 

like many other companies we anticipate upward pressures on energy costs to remain in fiscal 2009 this pressure may make gross margin improvements as a percentage of revenue difficult however we expect productivity improvements brought on by cost containment initiatives technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure to soften the adverse energy impact 

although difficult to predict we expect to make improvements to our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2009 the reorganization of our sales efforts has been completed and we expect to gain improved leverage from this organization in fiscal 2009 we also expect cost containment initiatives will offset anticipated increases to wages and benefits including medical expenses 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to the use of commercial paper of approximately 163 million with an average interest rate of 219 this exposure is limited by the investment in marketable securities which act as a hedge against variability in shortterm rates if shortterm rates change by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 1 million this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities on the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements

 item 1 business 

cintas corporation cintas a washington corporation provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types throughout the united states and canada cintas’ products and services are designed to enhance its customers’ images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and efficient work place cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer chairman of the board when he left his family’s industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970’s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business over the years cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to our customers 

the products and services provided by cintas are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these products and services are provided to approximately 800000 businesses of all types – from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people this diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of cintas’ total revenues as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

cintas classifies its business into two operating segments rentals and other services based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics of the products and services within each segment the rentals segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments mats mops and shop towels in addition to these rental items we also provide restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment the other services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products 

the following table sets forth the revenues derived from each operating segment provided by cintas 

 

see note 13 entitled segment information in “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

the primary markets served by both cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas’ locations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in both operating segments 

within the rentals segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches within the other services segment 

cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives in total cintas has approximately 7300 local delivery routes 407 operations and 7 distribution centers 

cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers in addition cintas operates eleven manufacturing facilities which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining these materials 

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 16 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 2 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

at may 31 2007 cintas employed approximately 34000 employees of which approximately 400 were represented by labor unions since january 2003 cintas has been the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation this is unacceptable cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights cintas considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory 

cintas files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission sec the public may copy these materials at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne room 1580 washington dc 20549 and may obtain further information concerning the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 800 sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains the same information regarding cintas that is filed electronically with the sec the address of that site is httpwwwsecgov cintas’ annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as posted on its website wwwcintascom as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing with the sec cintas is not including the other information contained on its website as part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k

also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

general economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions in north america and globally may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles higher fuel and other energy costs higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rentals and other services and selling and administrative expenses and could adversely affect our results of operations 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt our results of operations cintas’ competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to cintas these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition united states and canadian foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operations 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations 

cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by several unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and defend our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

 

within our document management business we handle customers’ confidential information our failure to protect our customers’ confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our document management business includes both document destruction and document storage services these services involve the handling of our customers’ confidential information and the subsequent shredding or storage of this information any compromise of security accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability which could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in additional costs in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while cintas regularly engages in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial condition and results of operations we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 12 entitled litigation and other contingencies of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operations 

the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended or “osha” establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration and various record keeping disclosure and procedural requirements various osha standards may apply to our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations the failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities payment of damages to private litigants and affect our ability to service our customers 

risks associated with our acquisition policy could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees 

 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our business could adversely affect our results of operations these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

business strategy 

cintas provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types throughout the united states and canada we refer to ourselves as “the service professionals” we bring value to our customers by helping them provide a cleaner safer more pleasant atmosphere for their customers and employees our products and services are designed to improve our customers’ image we also help our customers protect their employees and their company by enhancing workplace safety and helping to ensure legal compliance in key areas of their business 

we are north americas leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs as well as a significant provider of related business services including entrance mats restroom products and services first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products 

our business strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which cintas has not historically served we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers our longterm goal is to provide a product or service to every business in north america 

to pursue the strategy of increasing penetration we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis this frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships the combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services 

we pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in a few ways cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments our ever expanding range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect we also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion especially in our emerging businesses of first aid and safety fire protection and document management finally we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise 

continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks of our organization in order to sustain these efforts we employ a six sigma effort within cintas six sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating costs we are pleased with our progress in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this process will continue to yield to cintas 

 

results of operations 

fiscal 2007 marked the 38 th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas in addition to achieving this milestone cintas increased its diluted earnings per share by 89 and its dividends paid to shareholders by 114 during fiscal 2007 we reorganzied our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive this reorganization effort has taken longer and been more costly in fiscal 2007 than anticipated however cintas continues to believe that this reorganization will benefit revenue growth results in the longterm 

cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics of the products and services within each segment the rentals segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments mats mops and shop towels in addition to these rental items we also provide our restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment the other services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products both segments provide these products and services throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types  from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by segment and in total for the periods indicated 

 

 restated to reflect the adoption of fas 123r using the modifiedretrospective method see note 1 entitled significant accounting policies in “notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

as evidenced above our revenue growth continues to be higher in the other services segment versus the rentals segment resulting in a moderate shift in the percentage of revenue between our segments this shift was mainly driven by the acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

fiscal 2007 total revenue was 37 billion an increase of 89 over fiscal 2006 internal growth was 53 in fiscal 2007 compared to 78 in fiscal 2006 this decline in internal growth is due to economic pressure experienced throughout the year from the continued offshoring of manufacturing jobs as well as the ripple effect felt at other customers that serve these manufacturing businesses in addition the reorganization of our sales force has taken longer in the current year than we anticipated   our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

rentals segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 65 over fiscal 2006 internal growth for the rentals segment was 42 in fiscal 2007 the increase in the rentals segment revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained the main driver of our internal growth as we continued to sell rental programs to new customers we also continued to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being 

comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs the remaining growth of 23 in fiscal 2007 resulted from the acquisition of rental volume 

other services segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products the other services segment revenue increased 165 over fiscal 2006 internal growth in the other services segment was 86 in fiscal 2007 this internal growth was mainly due to an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services into our existing customer base the remaining revenue growth of 79 was generated through the acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 

cost of rentals increased 77 over fiscal 2006 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues in addition delivery labor increased 341 million due to increased rentals segment revenue and the introduction of our restroom cleaning service as a result cost of rentals as a percent of rentals segment revenues increased to 554 in fiscal 2007 compared to 548 in fiscal 2006 

cost of other services increased 126 over fiscal 2006 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2006 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions gross margin within this segment may fluctuate depending on the type of product or service sold as more cost efficient sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or specialization generate higher gross margins for example tailored garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog items the gross margin for fiscal 2007 is 372 the gross margin for the other services segment has historically been in the 30 to 35 range however a combination of economies of scale at growing operations six sigma sourcing improvements and other cost containment initiatives have allowed us to exceed this historical range due to the success of these initiatives and our continued efforts we believe the future gross margins will be in the 35 to 40 range 

selling and administrative expenses increased 101 over fiscal 2006 selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses in fiscal 2007 we reorganized our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive in the longterm this reorganization as well as increased marketing plans and sales promotions combined to increase our selling costs by 326 million over the prior fiscal year the cost of providing medical and retirement benefits to our employees increased 218 million representing a 157 increase over the prior year in addition administrative expenses increased by 71 million due to the amortization of intangibles generated by new acquisitions and 62 million as a result of an increase in professional services relating to legal and the outsourcing of certain human resource functions we also terminated a cash settled forward starting interest rate swap forward starting swap resulting in a 62 million reduction of administrative expenses this forward starting swap is explained in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased 188 million from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily a result of increased interest expense from higher debt outstanding as a result of our share buybacks 

income before income tax was 5336 million a 30 increase over fiscal 2006 income before income tax from the rentals segment decreased 01 over the prior year due to higher selling expenses associated with the reorganization of the sales force and higher delivery labor primarily as a result of our restroom cleaning service income before income tax for the other services segment increased 457 from the prior year mainly due to increased revenue and cost containment initiatives 

cintas effective tax rate was 373 for fiscal 2007 as compared to 376 for fiscal 2006 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

net income for fiscal 2007 of 3345 million was a 34 increase over fiscal 2006 and diluted earnings per share of 209 was an 89 increase over fiscal 2006 the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the impact of the share buyback program which is discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below return on average equity was 157 in fiscal 2007 and 154 in fiscal 2006 return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders’ equity 

we believe that this calculation gives management and shareholders a good indication of cintas’ historical performance 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

certain amounts below have been restated for the effects of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 123r sharedbased payment  using the modifiedretrospective method see the stockbased compensation section below within critical accounting policies for further information 

fiscal 2006 total revenue was 34 billion an increase of 110 over fiscal 2005 internal growth improved in fiscal 2006 to 78 up from 63 in fiscal 2005 our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

rentals segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 87 over fiscal 2005 the increase in rentals segment revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling rental programs to new customers we also continued to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was 73 in fiscal 2006 compared to 68 in fiscal 2005 we estimate that the effects of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma negatively impacted our rentals segment internal growth rate by approximately 03 the 14 of remaining growth in fiscal 2006 resulted from the acquisition of rental volume 

other services segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products other services segment revenue increased 186 over fiscal 2005 primarily due to acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 

internal revenue in the other services segment increased 96 over fiscal 2005 this increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services we estimate that the effects of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma negatively impacted our other services segment internal growth rate by approximately 04 growth in the other services segment continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base 

cost of rentals increased 86 over fiscal 2005 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues however rising energy costs also contributed to this increase rentals segment energy costs increased 317 in fiscal 2006 from 776 million in fiscal 2005 to 1022 million in fiscal 2006 various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year helped offset the significant increase in energy costs as a result cost of rentals as of percent of rentals segment revenues remained at 548 in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 

increases in energy costs will continue to impact our results of operations negatively in coming quarters except to the extent we are able to offset such costs with price increases and increased operating efficiencies our new orleans rental operation and gulf coast direct sale business continue to be impacted negatively by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma while physical damage to our facilities was minimal many of our customers in the region have yet to reopen or to return to prehurricane staffing levels this lower business volume will continue to have an impact on our results we are actively pursuing recoupment of our losses related to these hurricanes with our insurance carrier we do not yet have a clear indication of when a recoupment agreement will be resolved nor can we be sure of the amount we will receive 

cost of other services increased 162 over fiscal 2005 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2005 was due to the growth in other services segment revenue derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions gross margin within this segment may fluctuate depending on the type of product or service sold as more cost efficient sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or specialization generate higher gross margins for example tailored garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog items the gross margin for fiscal 2006 is 351 the gross margin for the other services segment has historically been in the 30 to 35 range however six sigma and other cost containment initiatives have allowed us to exceed this historical range due to the success of these initiatives and our continued efforts we believe the future gross margins will be in the 32 to 37 range 

selling and administrative expenses increased 114 over fiscal 2005 selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses in order to accelerate revenue growth we have increased our sales force marketing plans and sales promotions these measures combined to increase our selling costs by 240 million over the prior fiscal year the cost of providing medical and retirement benefits to our employees increased 170 million representing a 139 increase over the prior year in addition administrative expenses increased by 47 million as a result of an increase in the bad debt reserve and by 118 million as a result of an increase in professional services relating to legal and the outsourcing of certain human resource functions administrative expenses also increased by 52 million due to the amortization of intangibles generated by new acquisitions 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased 75 million from the prior fiscal year this increase in net interest expense is due to increased interest rates on our outstanding debt and the increased level of borrowing used to fund acquisitions and the stock buyback program 

income before income tax was 5180 million a 104 increase over fiscal 2005 income before income tax from the rentals segment increased 95 over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost containment initiatives which offset the increases in selling expenses medical and energy costs income before income tax for the other services segment increased 270 from the prior year mainly due to increased revenue and cost containment initiatives 

cintas effective tax rate was 376 for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

net income for fiscal 2006 of 3234 million was a 105 increase over fiscal 2005 and diluted earnings per share of 192 was a 136 increase over fiscal 2005 the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the impact of the share buyback program which is discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below return on average equity was 154 in fiscal 2006 and 147 in fiscal 2005 return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders’ equity we believe that this calculation gives management and shareholders a good indication of cintas’ historical performance 

liquidity and capital resources 

at may 31 2007 cintas had 1554 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities representing a decrease of 860 million from may 31 2006 or 356 this decrease is primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback program cash generated from operations was 4494 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to 4610 million generated in fiscal 2006 this 116 million decrease was primarily due to increased inventory levels and increased taxes paid offset by increased net income and lower rental items in service significant uses of cash in fiscal 2007 were capital expenditures of 1808 million acquisitions of 1607 million net of cash acquired repurchases of common stock of 1989 million and dividends of 620 million cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital expenditures expansion and share buybacks 

marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities cintas investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative the criteria used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield 

accounts receivable increased 190 million primarily due to increased revenues the average collection period in fiscal 2007 remained comparable with fiscal 2006 

inventories increased 337 million or 170 inventory levels at may 31 2006 were relatively low due to strong uniform sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the increase in inventory from may 31 2006 to may 31 2007 reflects a replenishment of inventory to more normalized levels 

working capital decreased 140 million to 7537 million in fiscal 2007 this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities for the execution of the share buyback program 

net property and equipment increased by 565 million due to continued investment in rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection and document management businesses capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 totaled 1808 million including 1328 million for the rentals segment and 480 million for the other services segment exceeding depreciation expense by approximately 456 million cintas continues to reinvest in land buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth during the year cintas completed construction of two new uniform rental facilities and has an additional five uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 will be between 1700 and 1900 million 

longterm debt totaled 8771 million at may 31 2007 this amount includes 2250 million in longterm debt due on june 1 2007 that was refinanced effective june 1 2007 under cintas’ existing commercial paper program longterm debt also includes 2250 million of tenyear senior notes at a rate of 60 which was borrowed in order to finance the omni acquisition in fiscal 2002 and 2500 million of thirtyyear senior notes issued in august 2006 at a rate of 615 proceeds from the thirtyyear senior notes issuance were used to extinguish outstanding commercial paper at the time of that debt issuance cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of “a” from standard  poor’s and “a2” from moody’s in addition longterm debt also includes 1680 million in commercial paper cintas utilizes a 6000 million commercial paper program on which it has earned credit ratings of “a1” from standard  poor’s and “prime1” from moody’s we believe these ratings are reflective of our commitment to conservative financial policies strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions the commercial paper program is fully supported by a longterm credit facility that matures in fiscal 2011 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 cintas entered into a forward starting swap to protect forecasted interest payments from interest rate movement in anticipation of a 2000 million 30year debt issuance in early fiscal 2008 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 cintas changed its intent on issuing this 30year debt this decision was based on current market conditions and interest rate environment as well as the additional payment flexibility provided to cintas under its commercial paper program as a result of this decision cintas terminated the forward starting swap and recorded the resulting 62 million gain in fiscal 2007 as a reduction of administrative expenses 

cintas’ total debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 276 at may 31 2006 to 289 at may 31 2007 total debt increased 824 million in fiscal 2007 through the net activity of debt issuance noted above see note 5 entitled longterm debt and note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” this additional indebtedness was used to execute the share buyback program during fiscal 2007 cintas bought back 1989 million of cintas stock 

during the year cintas paid dividends of 620 million or 039 per share on a per share basis this dividend is an increase of 114 over the dividend paid in fiscal 2006 this marks the 24 th consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend since going public in 1983 

on may 2 2005 cintas announced that the board of directors authorized a 5000 million stock buyback program at market prices in july 2006 cintas announced that the board of directors approved the expansion of its share buyback program by an additional 5000 million during fiscal 2007 cintas purchased 48 million shares of cintas stock at an average price of 4138 per share for a total purchase price of approximately 1989 million from the inception of the stock buyback program through july 27 2007 cintas has purchased 142 million shares of cintas stock at an average price of 4089 per share for a total purchase price of approximately 5806 million the board of directors did not specify an expiration date for this program

other commitments 

 

 

 

cintas has no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the synthetic lease on a corporate jet the synthetic lease on the aircraft does not currently have and is not reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on cintas’ financial condition changes in cintas’ financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation and changing prices 

changes in wages benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas’ financial results medical benefits and energy costs in particular continue to rise medical benefit costs have increased due to a combination of rising healthcare costs and an increase in the number of covered participants medical benefits were 34 of total revenues in fiscal 2007 and 32 of total revenues in fiscal 2006 energy costs were 33 of total revenues in fiscal 2007 and 34 of total revenues in fiscal 2006

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 16 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately 2 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

new accounting standards 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 cintas will adopt this interpretation on june 1 2007 and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of fin 48 on its consolidated financial statements any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of “notes to consolidated financial statements” significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each segment 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market substantially all inventories represent finished goods cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant garments linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from eight to fortyeight months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings five to twenty years for building improvements three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are 25

compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate longlived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs related to disposition 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment these tests include comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may 31 2007 2006 or 2005 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally five to ten years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may 31 2007 2006 or 2005 

stockbased compensation 

at may 31 2007 cintas had an equity compensation plan which is more fully described in note 11 entitled stockbased compensation of “notes to consolidated financial statements” prior to june 1 2006 cintas accounted for this plan under the intrinsic value method proscribed by apb opinion no 25 apb 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations as permitted by fasb statement no 123 fas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  effective june 1 2006 cintas adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 123r fas 123r sharebased payment  using the modifiedretrospective transition method under that transition method all prior periods have been restated based on the amounts previously calculated in the pro forma footnote disclosures required by fas 123 fas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including stock options to be recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income based on their fair values due to this restatement cintas’ income before income taxes and net income decreased by 38 million for the year ended may 31 2006 and 80 million for the year ended may 31 2005 this adoption lowered basic earnings per share from 195 per share to 193 per share for fiscal 2006 and from 175 per share to 170 per share for fiscal 2005 in addition diluted earnings per share were lowered from 194 per share to 192 per share for fiscal 2006 and from 174 per share to 169 per share for fiscal 2005 the cumulative effect of the change on paidincapital and retained earnings as of june 1 2005 was 21241 and 39567 respectively the cumulative effect of the change on deferred taxes as of june 1 2005 was less than 1million 

as a result of adopting fas 123r on june 1 2006 cintas’ income before income taxes and net income for the year ended may 31 2007 are 45 million and 31 million lower respectively than if cintas had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 basic and diluted earnings per share are both 02 lower for the year ended may 31 2007 than if cintas had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 

 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 

 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities please reference note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 

 

outlook 

our outlook is positive for fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2007 we reorganized our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive although this reorganization has taken longer and been more costly than anticipated we expect to see revenue growth benefits in fiscal 2008 and continued benefit over the longterm we will continue searching out additional products and services to become an even more valuable resource for our customers we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure quality products financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success as such we see upside potential for all of our business units although difficult to predict we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units 

in the marketplace competition and related pricing pressure will continue however we believe cost containment initiatives technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 

when appropriate opportunities arise we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 

like most other companies we experienced and anticipate continuing to experience increased costs for wages and benefits including medical benefits changes in energy costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also impact our results 

cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to the use of commercial paper of approximately 168 million with an average interest rate of 528 this exposure is limited by the investment in marketable securities which act as a hedge against variability in shortterm rates if shortterm rates change by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately 2 million this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities on the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements

these products and services are provided to over 700000 businesses of all types – from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people no individual customer accounts for greater than onehalf of one percent of cintas’ total revenues as a result the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas 

cintas classifies its business into two operating segments rentals and other services based on the similar economic characteristics of the products and services within each segment the rentals operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments mats mops and shop towels in addition to these rental items we also provide restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment the other services operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products 

the following table sets forth the revenues derived from each operating segment provided by cintas 

   

see note 13 entitled segment information in “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

the primary markets served by both cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented cintas competes with national regional and local providers and the level of competition varies at each of cintas’ locations product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in both operating segments 

within the rentals operating segment cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes based out of rental processing plants and branches within the other services operating segment cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the uniform rental industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 16 million in fiscal 2006 and approximately 14 million in fiscal 2005 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were 2 million in fiscal 2006 and 4 million in fiscal 2005 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

at may 31 2006 cintas employed approximately 32000 employees of whom approximately 450 were represented by labor unions since january 2003 cintas has been the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation this is unacceptable cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights cintas considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section as well as statements described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other sec filings describe risks that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline these risks are not the only risks that we face our business financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

in addition this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates” “anticipates” “projects” “plans” “expects” “intends” “believes” “seeks” “could” “should” “may” and “will” or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made these statements are subject to various risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy costs lower sales volumes the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs and possible effects of union organizing activities uncertainties regarding any existing or newlydiscovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation the cost results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the initiation or outcome of litigation higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products the disruption of operations from catastrophic events changes in federal and state tax laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service cintas undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made 

also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

general economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions in north america and globally may adversely affect our financial performance higher levels of unemployment inflation tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas products and services increases in labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs higher material costs for items such as linens and textiles higher fuel and other energy costs higher interest rates inflation higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rentals and other services and selling and administrative expenses and could adversely affect our operating results 

increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national regional and local providers product design price quality service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices cintas may be required to lower prices which would hurt our operating results cintas’ competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates in addition our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services inhouse instead of outsourcing these services to cintas these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

  

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our operating results 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial stability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition united states and canadian foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operating results 

an inability to open new cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts 

we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations zoning laws and other similar factors any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts and consequently adversely affect our financial performance 

unionization campaigns could adversely affect our operating results 

cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by several unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation we continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and defend our employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our operating results 

our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations while based on information currently known to us we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters our liability could exceed forecasted amounts and the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in additional costs in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

under environmental laws an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials while cintas regularly engages in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to thirdparty actions including tort suits 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial condition and operating results we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

risks associated with our acquisition policy could adversely affect our operating results 

historically a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth however there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions in addition the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition there can be no assurance that we will discover all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our operating results 

we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions 

we believe that part of our success is due to our corporate culture which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization this factor along with our entire operation depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees 

unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws andor regulations impacting our business could adversely affect our operating results these events could result in customer disruption physical damage to one or more key operating facilities the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation while we continue to evaluate our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

business strategy 

cintas provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types throughout the united states and canada we are north america’s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs as well as a significant provider of related business services including entrance mats restroom products and services first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products our products and services are designed to enhance our customers’ images and to provide additional safety and protection in the workplace 

our business strategy is to increase our market share of the uniform rental and sales business in north america through the sale of new uniform programs and to provide our customers with all of the products and services we offer we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers our longterm goal is to provide a product or service to every business in north america 

to pursue this strategy we focus on the development of a highly talented and diverse team of employees whom we call partners – a team that is properly trained and motivated to service our customers we support our partners’ service efforts by providing superior products with distinct competitive advantages and we embrace technological advances 

continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks of our organization in order to sustain these efforts we employ a six sigma effort within cintas six sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating costs we are pleased with our progress in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this process has and will continue to yield to cintas 

we continue to leverage our size and core competencies to become a more valued business service provider to our current and future customers we will also continue to supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions and the cultivation of new businesses 

results of operations 

fiscal 2006 marked the 37 th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas in addition to achieving this milestone cintas experienced healthy improvements in profits cash flow and balance sheet strength

cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services based on the similar economic characteristics of the products and services within each segment the rentals operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments mats mops and shop towels in addition to these rental items we also provide our restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment the other services operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products both segments provide these products and services throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types  from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people 

  

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated 

  

 

  

as evidenced above our revenue growth was higher in other services versus rentals during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 resulting in a moderate shift in the percentage of revenue between our reporting segments this shift was mainly driven by the acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

fiscal 2006 total revenue was 34 billion an increase of 110 over fiscal 2005 internal growth improved in fiscal 2006 to 78 up from 63 in fiscal 2005 our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments and the rental andor sale of mats mops shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 87 over fiscal 2005 the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling rental programs to new customers we also continued to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was 73 in fiscal 2006 compared to 68 in fiscal 2005 we estimate that the effects of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma negatively impacted our rentals internal growth rate by approximately 03 the 14 of remaining growth in fiscal 2006 resulted from the acquisition of rental volume 

  

other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms and related items first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and branded promotional products other services revenue increased 186 over fiscal 2005 primarily due to acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 

internal revenue in the other services segment increased 96 over fiscal 2005 this increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services we estimate that the effects of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma negatively impacted our other services internal growth rate by approximately 04 growth in the other services segment continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base 

cost of rentals increased 86 over fiscal 2005 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues however rising energy costs also contributed to this increase rentals energy costs increased 32 in fiscal 2006 from approximately 78 million in fiscal 2005 to approximately 102 million in fiscal 2006 various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year helped offset the significant increase in energy costs as a result cost of rentals as of percent of rentals revenues remained at 548 in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 

increases in energy costs will continue to impact our operating results negatively in coming quarters except to the extent we are able to offset such costs with price increases and increased operating efficiencies our new orleans rental operation and gulf coast direct sale business continue to be impacted negatively by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma while physical damage to our facilities was minimal many of our customers in the region have yet to reopen or to return to prehurricane staffing levels this lower business volume will continue to have an impact on our results we are actively pursuing recoupment of our losses related to these hurricanes with our insurance carrier we do not yet have a clear indication of when a recoupment agreement will be resolved nor can we be sure of the amount we will receive 

cost of other services increased 162 over fiscal 2005 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2005 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions gross margin within this segment may fluctuate depending on the type of product or service sold as more cost efficient sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or specialization generate higher gross margins for example tailored garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog items the gross margin for fiscal 2006 is 351 the gross margin for other services has historically been in the 30 to 35 range however six sigma and other cost containment initiatives have allowed us to exceed this historical range due to the success of these initiatives and our continued efforts we believe the future gross margins will be in the 32 to 37 range 

selling and administrative expenses increased 121 over fiscal 2005 selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses in order to accelerate revenue growth we have increased our sales force marketing plans and sales promotions these measures combined to increase our selling costs by approximately 240 million over the prior fiscal year the cost of providing medical and retirement benefits to our employees increased 170 million representing a 139 increase over the prior year in addition administrative expenses increased by 47 million as a result of an increase in the bad debt reserve and by 118 million as a result of an increase in professional services relating to legal and the outsourcing of certain human resource functions administrative expenses also increased by 52 million due to the amortization of intangibles generated by new acquisitions 

net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased 75 million from the prior fiscal year this increase in net interest expense is due to increased interest rates on our outstanding debt and the increased level of borrowing used to fund acquisitions and the stock repurchase program 

pretax income was 522 million a 94 increase over fiscal 2005 pretax income from the rentals segment increased 86 over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost containment initiatives which offset the increases in selling expenses medical and energy costs pretax income for the other services segment increased 247 from the prior year mainly due to increased revenue and cost containment initiatives 

  

cintas’ effective tax rate was 373 for fiscal 2006 which is comparable to the 370 in fiscal 2005 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” and the outlook section below 

net income for fiscal 2006 of 327 million was an 89 increase over fiscal 2005 and diluted earnings per share of 194 was an 115 increase over fiscal 2005 the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the impact of the share repurchase program which is discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below return on average equity was 156 in fiscal 2006 and 151 in fiscal 2005 return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders’ equity we believe that this calculation gives management and shareholders a good indication of cintas’ historical performance 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

fiscal 2005 total revenue was 31 billion an increase of 90 over fiscal 2004 internal growth improved throughout fiscal 2005 and was 63 for the year as the economy continued to strengthen and employment rates improved our internal growth rates improved internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays by quarter and for the year where applicable 

   

historically increases in our internal growth rate have lagged an economic upturn as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental andor sale of corporate identity uniforms mats shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 74 over fiscal 2004 internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was 68 in fiscal 2005 compared to 42 in fiscal 2004 the 06 of remaining growth in fiscal 2005 resulted from the acquisition of rental volume 

the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers we also continued to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs rentals revenue growth was partially offset by lost business of approximately 70 

other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services other direct sale products and services include cleanroom supplies first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services other services revenue increased 149 over fiscal 2004 primarily due to acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 

internal revenue growth in the other services segment was 44 for the year this increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services growth in these areas continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base 

  

cost of rentals increased 60 over fiscal 2004 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues rising energy costs also contributed to this increase various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year provided a decrease in cost of rentals as a percent to rentals revenue from 555 in fiscal 2004 to 548 in fiscal 2005 

cost of other services increased 152 over fiscal 2004 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2004 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions gross margin within this segment generally fluctuates between 30 to 35 depending on the type of product or service sold products which require additional services generate higher gross margins the gross margin for fiscal 2005 is 337 which is in the upper portion of that general range mainly due to a shift in the product mix 

selling and administrative expenses increased 114 over fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses in order to accelerate revenue growth we have increased our sales force marketing plans and sales promotions these measures combined to increase our selling costs by approximately 36 million over the prior fiscal year the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees also increased approximately 15 million the costs of providing medical benefits are anticipated to continue to rise 

net interest expense decreased 5 million from the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily a result of increased interest income due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities throughout the entire year and an increase in the interest rate environment 

pretax income was 477 million a 104 increase over fiscal 2004 pretax income from the rentals segment increased 92 over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost containment initiatives which more than offset the increases in selling expenses and medical costs pretax income for the other services segment decreased 14 from the prior year mainly due to increased selling expenses and medical costs 

cintas’ effective tax rate was 370 for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” and the outlook section below 

net income for fiscal 2005 of 301 million was a 104 increase over fiscal 2004 and diluted earnings per share of 174 was a 101 increase over fiscal 2004 both of which are consistent with the increases in pretax income return on average equity was approximately 15 in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders’ equity we believe that this calculation gives management and shareholders a good indication of cintas’ historical performance 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 55 million in fiscal 2005 or 217 primarily due to increased revenues cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital expenditures expansion and possible stock repurchases marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 

accounts receivable increased 41 million due to increased revenues accounts receivable also increased due to a loan to an affiliated company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the board of directors approved and cintas provided a 10 million loan to an affiliated company with specific repayment terms over the next three years this affiliated company manufactures a significant portion of cintas’ mats a dividend of 5 million was subsequently received by cintas from this affiliate in the first quarter of fiscal 2006

liquidity and capital resources 

at may 31 2006 cintas had 241 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities representing a decrease of 68 million from may 31 2005 or 22 this decrease is primarily due to acquisitions and the share repurchase program cash generated from operations was 462 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 414 million generated in fiscal 2005 this 48 million increase was primarily due to increased net income significant uses of cash in fiscal 2006 were capital expenditures of 157 million acquisitions of 346 million net of cash acquired common stock repurchases of 323 million and dividends of 59 million cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital expenditures expansion and share repurchases 

marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities cintas’ investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield is the criteria used in making investment decisions 

accounts receivable increased 63 million primarily due to increased revenues the average collection period in fiscal 2006 remained comparable with fiscal 2005 

inventories decreased 18 million or 85 mainly due to inventory management initiatives within our distribution network we were able to reduce inventory despite an 11 increase in revenues 

working capital decreased 45 million to 766 million in fiscal 2006 this decrease is primarily the result of decreased cash and marketable securities and inventories and increased accrued liabilities offset by an increase in accounts receivable 

net property and equipment increased by 47 million due to continued investment in rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of rental first aid safety and fire protection and document management businesses capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 totaled 157 million including 125 million for the rentals segment and 32 million for other services exceeding depreciation expense by 30 million cintas continues to reinvest in land buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth during the year cintas completed construction of one new uniform rental facility and has an additional two uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 will be between 150 and 170 million

cintas’ total debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 183 at may 31 2005 to 276 at may 31 2006 total debt increased 326 million in fiscal 2006 due to the issuance of commercial paper through our line of credit cintas issued commercial paper in fiscal 2006 in order to use the proceeds to execute the share repurchase program during fiscal 2006 cintas repurchased 323 million of cintas stock in addition commercial paper proceeds were used to fund multiple acquisitions see note 5 entitled longterm debt and note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” subsequent to may 31 2006 cintas borrowed an additional 56 million under the 400 million commercial paper program for shortterm cash requirements this financing decision was made in order to allow certain marketable securities to reach maturity rather than cintas incurring a penalty for early redemption 

during the year cintas paid dividends of 59 million or 035 per share on a per share basis this dividend is an increase of 94 over the dividend paid in fiscal 2005 this marks the 23 rd consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend since going public in 1983

inflation and changing prices 

changes in wages benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas’ financial results medical benefits and energy costs in particular continue to rise medical benefit costs have increased due to a combination of rising healthcare costs and an increase in the number of covered participants medical benefits were 32 of total revenues in fiscal 2006 and 31 of total revenues in fiscal 2005 energy costs were 34 of total revenues in fiscal 2006 and 28 of total revenues in fiscal 2005

the litigation discussed above if decided adversely to or settled by cintas may individually or in the aggregate result in liability material to cintas’ financial condition or results of operations cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of cintas’ shareholders 

  

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 16 million in fiscal 2006 and approximately 14 million in fiscal 2005 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were 2 million in fiscal 2006 and 4 million in fiscal 2005 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

new accounting standards 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  statement 123r which is a revision of fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as an expense in the statement of income based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative the new standard is effective for public entities excluding small business issuers no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 cintas will adopt this statement on june 1 2006 the effect of adoption of sfas 123r is currently estimated to be approximately 5 million 003 per share aftertax for fiscal 2007 however cintas’ actual sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2007 depends on a number of factors including fair value of awards at the time of grant 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of cintas’ consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of “notes to consolidated financial statements” significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized either when services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

cintas establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market substantially all inventories represent finished goods cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 

uniforms and other rental items in service 

uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant garments linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to fortyeight months the 

  

amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas’ experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements 

property and equipment 

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings five to twenty years for building improvements three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate longlived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs related to disposition 

goodwill and impairment 

goodwill obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment these tests include comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may 31 2006 2005 or 2004 

service contracts and other assets 

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally five to ten years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may 31 2006 2005 or 2004 

litigation and environmental matters 

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements 

a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities please reference note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 

  

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate based on cintas’ evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 

outlook 

our outlook remains positive for fiscal 2007 in an effort to further increase our revenue we are reorganizing our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive we will also continue searching out additional products and services to become an even more valuable resource for our customers as such we see upside potential for all of our business units although difficult to predict we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units 

in the marketplace competition and related pricing pressure will continue however we believe cost containment initiatives technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 

when appropriate opportunities arise we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 

like most other companies we experienced and anticipate continuing to experience increased costs for wages and benefits including medical benefits changes in energy costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also impact our results 

cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights 

we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure quality products financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success however a number of factors influence future revenue margins and profit which make forecasting difficult 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately 338 million with an average interest rate of 50 this exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in shortterm rates if shortterm rates change by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas’ income before taxes would change by approximately 2 million this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas’ capital structure 

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements

 item 1 

business   

cintas corporation a washington corporation provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types throughout the united states and canada cintas designs manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs provides entrance mats shop towels restroom supplies promotional products first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services for over 700000 businesses cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer chairman of the board when he left his family’s industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970’s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business 

  

cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services the rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents to its customers other items including entrance mats shop towels and restroom supplies are also rented or sold to its customers the other services operating segment involves the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services these ancillary products and services include first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and cleanroom supplies 

  

the primary markets served by cintas are local in nature and highly fragmented competition for this business varies at each of cintas’ locations there are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of cintas although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms in certain instances local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of cintas in a particular market cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect these operations are product quality service design and price 

  

cintas serves these markets principally through the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing ongoing uniform replacements as required to each customer cintas also provides ancillary products and services which include the rental or sale of entrance mats shop towels mops linen and restroom products and first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services 

  

due to its diverse customer base and average account size the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas no individual customer accounts for greater than one percent of cintas’ total revenues 

  

in its sale of customized uniforms cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect these operations are design service and price 

  

cintas operates fourteen manufacturing facilities which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs additional products are purchased from numerous outside suppliers because of cintas’ ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on cintas cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials 

  

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 14 million in fiscal 2005 and approximately 12 million in fiscal 2004 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were 4 million in fiscal 2005 and 3 million in fiscal 2004 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

  

at may 31 2005 cintas employed approximately 30000 employees of which approximately 450 were represented by labor unions since january 2003 cintas has been the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas 

  

  

into surrendering its employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation this is unacceptable cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights cintas considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory 

  

cintas files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission the public may copy these materials at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne room 1580 washington dc 20549 and may obtain further information concerning the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 202 5518090 the sec maintains an internet site that contains the same information regarding cintas that is filed electronically with the sec the address of that site is httpwwwsecgov cintas’ annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are posted on its website wwwcintascom as soon as practicable after filing with the sec

results of operations 

  

fiscal 2005 marked the 36 th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas in addition to achieving this milestone cintas experienced healthy improvements in profitability cash flow and balance sheet strength 

  

cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services the rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents to its customers other items including entrance mats shop towels and restroom supplies are also rented or sold to its customers the other services operating segment involves the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services these ancillary products and services include first aid safety and fire protection products and services document management services and cleanroom supplies these services are provided throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types  from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people 

  

  

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated 

  

   

as evidenced above our revenue growth has been higher in other services versus rentals during fiscal 2005 resulting in a moderate shift in the percentage of revenue between our reporting segments this shift was mainly driven by the acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

  

fiscal 2005 total revenue was 31 billion an increase of 90 over fiscal 2004 internal growth improved throughout fiscal 2005 and was 63 for the year as the economy continued to strengthen and employment rates improved our internal growth rates improved internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays by quarter and for the year where applicable 

  

   

historically increases in our internal growth rate have lagged an economic upturn as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

  

rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental andor sale of corporate identity uniforms mats shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 74 over fiscal 2004 internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was 68 in fiscal 2005 compared to 42 in fiscal 2004 the 06 of remaining growth in fiscal 2005 resulted from the acquisition of rental volume 

  

the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers we also continued to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs rentals revenue growth was partially offset by lost business of approximately 70 

  

other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services other direct sale products and services include cleanroom supplies first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services other services revenue increased 149 over fiscal 2004 primarily due to acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 

  

internal revenue growth in the other services segment was 44 for the year this increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid safety and fire protection products and services and document management services growth in these areas continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base 

  

cost of rentals increased 60 over fiscal 2004 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms mats shop towels and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues rising oil and fuel costs also contributed to this increase various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year provided a decrease in cost of rentals as a percent to rentals revenue from 555 in fiscal 2004 to 548 in fiscal 2005 

  

cost of other services increased 152 over fiscal 2004 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2004 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions gross margin within this segment generally fluctuates between 30 to 35 depending on the type of product or service sold products which require additional services generate higher gross margins the gross margin for fiscal 2005 is 337 which is in the upper portion of that general range mainly due to a shift in the product mix 

  

selling and administrative expenses increased 114 over fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses in order to accelerate revenue growth we have increased our sales force marketing plans and sales promotions these measures combined to increase our selling costs by approximately 36 million over the prior fiscal year the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees also increased approximately 15 million the costs of providing medical benefits are anticipated to continue to rise 

  

net interest expense decreased 5 million from the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily a result of increased interest income due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities throughout the entire year and an increase in the interest rate environment 

  

pretax income was 477 million a 104 increase over fiscal 2004 pretax income from the rentals segment increased 92 over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost containment initiatives which more than offset the increases in selling expenses and medical costs pretax income for the other services segment decreased 14 from the prior year mainly due to increased selling expenses and medical costs 

  

cintas’ effective tax rate was 370 for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” and the outlook section below 

  

net income for fiscal 2005 of 301 million was a 104 increase over fiscal 2004 and diluted earnings per share of 174 was a 101 increase over fiscal 2004 both of which are consistent with the increases in pretax income return on average equity was approximately 15 in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders’ equity 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 55 million in fiscal 2005 or 217 primarily due to increased revenues cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital 

  

  

expenditures expansion and possible stock repurchases marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 

  

accounts receivable increased 41 million due to increased revenues accounts receivable also increased due to a loan to an affiliated company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the board of directors approved and cintas provided a 10 million loan to an affiliated company with specific repayment terms over the next three years this affiliated company manufactures a significant portion of cintas’ mats a dividend of 5 million was subsequently received by cintas from this affiliate in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

  

inventories increased 28 million mainly due to increased revenues other contributing factors include the continued increase in international sourcing of product a current conversion of our comfort pant to a new fabric and style and additional inventory requirements for our uniform book a large catalog used for the direct sale of uniforms and accessories 

  

net property and equipment increased by 32 million due to continued investment in rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of first aid safety and fire protection and document management businesses capital expenditures exceeded depreciation expense by 21 million during the year cintas completed construction of five new uniform rental facilities and has an additional three uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations 

  

total debt decreased 12 million through repayment of certain debt net of the change in fair market value of the debt see note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

  

fiscal 2004 total revenue was 28 billion an increase of 47 over fiscal 2003 this growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed for much of the year internal growth for fiscal 2004 when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was 30 weakness in employment numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our business mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective as employment numbers strengthened over the second half of the year our internal growth rates improved internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays by quarter and for the year where applicable 

  

   

historically increases in our internal growth rate have lagged an economic upturn as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base 

  

the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid and safety service businesses and document management businesses information related to acquisitions is discussed in note 8 entitled acquisitions of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental andor sale of corporate identity uniforms mats shop towels restroom supplies and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 43 when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was 42 adjusted for the additional workday the amount of acquired rental volume was insignificant for the year ending may 31 2004 

  

the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained healthy as we experienced continued 

  

  

success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers we continue to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs rentals revenue growth was mitigated by lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the sluggish economy especially during the first half of the year 

  

other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services other direct sale products and services include cleanroom supplies first aid and safety products and services and document management services other services revenue increased 44 when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses 

  

internal revenue in the other services segment adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 decreased by 13 for the year this decrease was mainly due to the continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the hospitality and airline industries weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers have continued to impact our direct sales effort partially offsetting this internal revenue decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale of first aid products and services and document management services 

  

cost of rentals increased 42 over fiscal 2003 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2003 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues an increase in fuel and energy costs and a rise in labor delivery costs also contributed to this increase further assimilation of operations obtained through the omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year mitigated the increased fuel energy and delivery costs 

  

cost of other services increased 28 over fiscal 2003 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2003 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived predominantly through acquisitions the increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue from 673 in fiscal 2003 to 661 in fiscal 2004 sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and other cost containment initiatives including six sigma initiatives implemented throughout the year supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue 

  

selling and administrative expenses increased 46 over fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased revenues the continued rise in medical costs and increased legal expenses contributed to the increase 

  

net interest expense decreased 6 million from the prior year this decrease was primarily a result of lower debt outstanding total outstanding debt decreased 79 million from may 31 2003 to may 31 2004 as cash from operations was used to reduce debt which had been incurred predominantly during the acquisition of omni in may 2002 see the liquidity and capital resources section below and note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

a writeoff of a loan receivable from a garment manufacturer is included in net income as a pretax charge of 43 million due to developments concerning the supplier’s viability to remain as a going concern the collectibility of the receivable was doubtful as such the receivable was completely written off 

  

pretax income was 432 million a 92 increase over fiscal 2003 pretax income from the rentals segment increased 67 over the prior year due to higher rental revenue increased efficiencies obtained from the assimilation of operations obtained from the omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives pretax income for the other services segment increased 196 from the prior year due to increased sales volume the continued leveraging of fixed costs and sourcing and cost containment initiatives 

  

cintas’ effective tax rate was 370 for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

net income for fiscal 2004 of 272 million was a 92 increase over fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share of 158 was a 90 increase over fiscal 2003 return on average equity was 154 in fiscal 2004 and 162 in fiscal 2003 return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders’ equity 

  

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 197 million in fiscal 2004 or 3411 primarily due to increased revenues a reduction in inventory levels and to a lesser extent a reduction in uniform and other rental items in service levels cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital expenditures and expansion marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 

  

accounts receivable increased 7 million due to increased revenues aggressive collection efforts provided for a lower sequential increase in accounts receivable as compared to total revenue growth 

  

inventories decreased 43 million due to improved processes and management systems including cycle time reductions and other process improvements initiated primarily through our six sigma process the completion of the omni product line consolidation also contributed to this decrease in inventory levels 

  

net property and equipment increased by 8 million due to real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures by 4 million as cintas continued to consolidate operations obtained from the omni acquisition in may of 2002 in addition due to excess plant capacity and a sluggish economy cintas slowed the pace of new plant construction during the year cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and has an additional eight uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations 

  

total debt decreased 79 million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of omni net of the change in fair market value of the debt see note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements” this significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at may 31 2005 cintas had 309 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities representing an increase of 55 million from may 31 2004 this increase is primarily due to increased net income cash generated from operations was 414 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 510 million generated in fiscal 2004 this 96 million decrease was primarily due to increased accounts receivable and inventory levels significant uses of cash in fiscal 2005 were capital expenditures of 141 million acquisitions of 109 million net of cash acquired common stock repurchases of 58 million and dividends of 55 million 

  

cintas’ investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield is the criteria used in making investment decisions 

  

working capital increased 102 million to 810 million in fiscal 2005 this increase is primarily the result of increased cash and marketable securities and accounts receivable 

  

capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 totaled 141 million including 118 million for the rentals segment and 23 million for other services cintas continues to reinvest in land buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 will be between 150 and 170 million

cintas is also a defendant in a lawsuit j lester alexander iii vs cintas corp et al  which was originally filed on october 25 2004 and is currently pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of alabama eastern division the case was brought by j lester alexander iii the chapter 7 trustee the “trustee” of terry manufacturing company inc “tmc” and terry uniform company llc “tuc” against cintas in randolph county alabama the trustee seeks damages against cintas for allegedly breaching fiduciary duties to tmc and tuc and for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by others to those entities the complaint also includes allegations that cintas breached certain limited liability company agreements or alternatively misrepresented their intention to perform their obligations in those agreements and acted as alter egos of the bankrupt tmc and are therefore liable for all of tmc’s debts the trustee is seeking 50 million in compensatory damages and 100 million in punitive damages cintas denies these claims and is vigorously defending itself against all claims in the complaint if there is an adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of this lawsuit the resulting liability could be material to cintas any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time 

  

during fiscal 2001 the state of connecticut filed suit against cintas in the superior court district of hartford alleging various violations of state environmental laws and alleging that cintas violated certain wastewater discharge and hazardous waste violations while this proceeding is not considered material to the business or financial condition of the registrant management reasonably believes that the proceedings will result in monetary sanctions in excess of 100 thousand a reserve has been established for the estimated liability related to these allegations 

  

the litigation discussed above if decided adversely to or settled by cintas may individually or in the aggregate result in liability material to cintas’ financial condition or results of operations cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of cintas’ shareholders 

  

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the industry while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs primarily for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately 14 million in fiscal 2005 and approximately 12 million in fiscal 2004 capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were 4 million in fiscal 2005 and 3 million in fiscal 2004 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws 

  

new accounting standards 

  

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  statement 123r which is a revision of fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 cintas will adopt this statement no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2007 cintas is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on its financial position and results of operations 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of cintas’ consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of “notes to consolidated financial statements” significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized either when services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer cintas establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market substantially all inventories represent finished goods cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 

  

uniforms and other rental items in service 

  

uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant garments linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to fortyeight months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas’ experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements 

  

property and equipment 

  

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings five to twenty years for building improvements three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate longlived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs related to disposition 

  

goodwill and impairment 

  

goodwill primarily obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment these tests include comparisons to current market values where available and discounted cash flow analyses significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may 31 2005 2004 or 2003 

  

service contracts and other assets 

  

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally five to ten years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models 

  

  

involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may 31 2005 2004 or 2003 

  

environmental matters and related litigation 

  

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 

  

income taxes 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities please reference note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 

  

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves for probable exposures based on cintas’ evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 

  

outlook 

  

as we look forward to fiscal 2006 our outlook remains positive but guarded as the economy has strengthened and employment rates have improved our internal growth rates have also continued to improve based on our marketing data we have a relatively low 7 market share of a 425 billion estimated potential market as such we see upside potential for all of our business units although difficult to predict we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units overall performance will be largely driven by external market conditions 

  

in the marketplace competition and related pricing pressure will continue however we believe cost containment initiatives technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 

  

when appropriate opportunities arise we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 

  

like most other companies we experienced and anticipate continuing to experience increased costs for wages and benefits including medical benefits changes in oil and fuel costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also have the potential to impact our results 

  

cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation this is unacceptable cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights 

  

we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure quality products financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success however a number of factors influence future revenue margins and profit which make forecasting difficult 

  

  




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure 

about market risk   

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately 230 million with an average interest rate of 46 this exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in shortterm rates if shortterm rates change by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas’ income before taxes would change by approximately 1 million this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas’ capital structure 

  

through its foreign operations cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements

the rental markets served by cintas are highly fragmented and competition for this business varies at each of cintas’ locations there are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of cintas although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms in certain instances local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of cintas in a particular market cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect its operations are product quality service design and price 

  

the service provided to the rental markets served by cintas principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing ongoing uniform replacements as required to each customer cintas also offers ancillary products which include the rental or sale of entrance mats fender covers towels mops linen and restroom products and first aid and safety products and services

in its sale of customized uniforms cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers 

  

cintas operates fourteen manufacturing facilities which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs additional products are purchased from numerous outside suppliers because of cintas’ ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on cintas cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

  

business strategy 

  

we are north america’s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs as well as related business services including entrance mats restroom products first aid and safety products and services document management services and cleanroom services our services are designed to enhance our customers’ images and to provide additional safety and protection in the workplace 

  

our business strategy is to increase our market share of the uniform rental and sales business in north america through the sale of new uniform programs and to provide our customers with all of the products and services we offer we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities to provide to our current and future customers our longterm goal is to provide a product or service to every business in north america 

  

to pursue this strategy we focus on the development of a highly talented and diverse team of employees who we call partners – a team that is properly trained and motivated to service our customers we support our partners’ service efforts by providing superior products with distinct competitive advantages and we embrace technological advances 

  

continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks of our organization a more formalized approach in these areas was recently initiated when we commenced a six sigma effort within cintas six sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating costs we are pleased with our progress in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this process will yield to cintas 

  

we continue to leverage our size and core competencies to become a more valued business service provider to our current and future customers we will also continue to supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions and the cultivation of new businesses 

  

results of operations 

  

fiscal 2004 marked the 35 th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas in addition to achieving this milestone cintas experienced healthy improvements in profitability cash flow and balance sheet strength this was accomplished while finalizing the integration of the largest uniform rental acquisition in cintas’ history omni services inc omni 

  

cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services the rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents along with other items to its customers the other services operating segment involves the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services these ancillary products and services include restroom supplies first aid and safety products and services document management services and cleanroom supplies all of these services are provided throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types  from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people 

  

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated 

  

   

as evidenced above our revenue growth has been consistent between our reporting segments with rentals and other services each accounting for a consistent percentage of revenue the past two fiscal years we have increased our gross margins in both segments in fiscal 2004 while maintaining selling and administrative costs as a percent of revenues this overall income improvement occurred despite the soft economy that existed for much of the year and the continued rise in fuel wage and benefit costs 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

  

fiscal 2004 total revenue was 28 billion an increase of 47 over fiscal 2003 this growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed for much of the year internal growth for fiscal 2004 when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was 30 weakness in employment numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our business mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective as employment numbers strengthened over the second half of the year our internal growth rates improved internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of work days by quarter and for the year where applicable 

  

   

 

historically increases in our internal growth rate have lagged employment growth levels as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs our organic growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base 

  

the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid and safety service businesses and document management businesses 

  

rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms mats shop towels and other rental services revenue from the rentals segment increased 43 when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was 42 adjusted for the additional workday the amount of acquired rental volume was insignificant for the year ending may 31 2004 

  

the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers we continue to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs rentals revenue growth was mitigated by lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the sluggish economy especially during the first half of the year 

  

other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services other direct sale products and services include restroom and cleanroom supplies first aid and safety products and services and document management services other services revenue increased 44 when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses 

  

internal revenue in the other services segment adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 decreased by 13 for the year this decrease was mainly due to the continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the hospitality and airline industries weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers has continued to impact our direct sales effort partially offsetting this internal revenue decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale of first aid products and services and document management services 

  

cost of rentals increased 42 over fiscal 2003 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory including uniforms and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2003 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues an increase in fuel and energy costs and a rise in labor delivery costs also contributed to this increase further assimilation of operations obtained through the omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year mitigated the increased fuel energy and delivery costs 

  

cost of other services increased 28 over fiscal 2003 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2003 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived predominantly through acquisitions the increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue from 67 in fiscal 2003 to 66 in fiscal 2004 sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and other cost containment initiatives including six sigma initiatives implemented throughout the year supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue 

  

selling and administrative expenses increased 46 over fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased revenues the continued rise in medical costs and increased legal expenses contributed to the increase 

  

net interest expense decreased 6 million from the prior year this decrease was primarily a result of lower debt outstanding total outstanding debt decreased 79 million from may 31 2003 to may 31 2004 as cash from operations was used to reduce debt which had been incurred predominantly during the acquisition of omni in may 2002 see the liquidity and capital resources section below and note 5 entitled longterm debt of “note to consolidated financial statements”

  

 

a writeoff of a loan receivable from a garment manufacturer is included in net income as a pretax charge of 43 million due to developments concerning the supplier’s viability to remain as a going concern the collectibility of the receivable was doubtful as such the receivable was completely written off 

  

pretax income was 432 million a 92 increase over fiscal 2003 pretax income from the rentals segment increased 67 over the prior year due to higher rental revenue increased efficiencies obtained from the assimilation of operations obtained from the omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives pretax income for the other services segment increased 196 from the prior year due to increased sales volume the continued leveraging of fixed costs and sourcing and cost containment initiatives 

  

cintas’ effective tax rate was 37 for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements”

  

net income for fiscal 2004 of 272 million was a 9 increase over fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share of 158 was a 9 increase over fiscal 2003 return on average equity was 15 in fiscal 2004 and 16 in fiscal 2003 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 197 million in fiscal 2004 or 341 primarily due to increased revenues a reduction in inventory levels and to a lesser extent a reduction in uniform and other rental items in service levels cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital expenditures and expansion marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 

  

accounts receivable increased 7 million due to increased revenues aggressive collection efforts provided for a lower sequential increase in accounts receivable as compared to total revenue growth 

  

inventories decreased 43 million due to improved processes and management systems including cycle time reductions and other process improvements initiated primarily through our six sigma process the completion of the omni product line consolidation also contributed to this decrease in inventory levels 

  

net property and equipment increased by 8 million due to real estate purchased in conjunction with acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures by 4 million as cintas continued to consolidate operations obtained from the omni acquisition in may of 2002 in addition due to excess plant capacity and a sluggish economy cintas slowed the pace of new plant construction during the year cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and has an additional eight uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations 

  

total debt decreased 79 million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of omni net of the change in fair market value of the debt see note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements” this significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations

  

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

  

fiscal 2003 marked the 34 th year of uninterrupted growth for cintas total revenue was 27 billion an increase of 18 over fiscal 2002 this growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed throughout the year the continued weakness in employment numbers directly affected our business mainly through reduced uniform wearers and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective we continued to grow organically in this environment mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs 

  

rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms mats shop towels and other items through our uniform rental division revenue from the rentals segment increased 20 primarily due to the acquisition of omni in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and growth in the customer base despite slow economic growth internal growth in the rentals segment adjusted for one less workday during fiscal 2003 averaged over 4 for the year new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform 

  

 

rental programs to new customers we continue to expand our rental market with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs rentals revenue growth was mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the current sluggish economy in the united states and the resulting reduction in the work force 

  

other services operating segment revenues are derived from the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers as well as the sale of ancillary services including restroom supplies first aid products and services and cleanroom supplies other services revenue increased 13 primarily due to acquisitions made in late fiscal 2002 and increased customer sales despite slow economic growth internal growth in the other services segment adjusted for one less workday during fiscal 2003 averaged 2 for the year revenues from the sale of ancillary services increased 11 for the year due to increased selling efforts this growth was partially offset by a 3 decrease in revenues from the direct sale of uniforms to our customers this decrease was primarily a result of continued weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers revenue growth in other services was also mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the current sluggish economy in the united states and the resulting reduction in the work force 

  

cost of rentals increased 23 over fiscal 2002 cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses delivery expenses and amortization of in service uniforms and other rental items the cost increase over fiscal 2002 was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues a rise in fuel and energy costs as well as an increase in delivery costs associated with the omni acquisition primarily due to expanded route geography and smaller route size also contributed to this increase cost containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated the increased fuel energy and delivery costs 

  

cost of other services increased 9 over fiscal 2002 cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products delivery expenses and distribution expenses the increase over fiscal 2002 was due to the growth in other services revenue derived primarily through acquisitions the increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue from 70 in fiscal 2002 to 67 in fiscal 2003 cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year also supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue 

  

selling and administrative expenses increased 20 over fiscal 2002 this increase was primarily due to increased revenues the continued rise in medical costs and additional travel expenses also contributed to this increase the increased travel expense was a result of the omni acquisition and related integration as well as a return to more normalized travel versus fiscal 2002 when travel expenses were lower due to the impact of the events of september 11 we also continue to invest heavily in our selling process in order to provide for future growth 

  

net interest expense increased 23 million from the prior year this increase was primarily a result of interest on 450 million in longterm notes issued in late fiscal 2002 to finance the omni acquisition see the liquidity and capital resources section below and note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements”

  

pretax income was 396 million a 7 increase over fiscal 2002 pretax income from the rentals segment increased 7 over the prior year primarily due to the higher rental revenue pretax income was negatively impacted by assimilation costs associated with the omni acquisition pretax income for the other services segment increased 84 from the prior year due to increased sales volume and related leveraging of fixed costs cost containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated increased delivery medical and fuel costs 

  

cintas’ effective tax rate was 37 for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 see also note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements”

  

net income for fiscal 2003 of 249 million was a 6 increase over fiscal 2002 and diluted earnings per share of 145 was a 7 increase over fiscal 2002 return on average equity was 16 in fiscal 2003 and 18 in fiscal 2002 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by 27 million in fiscal 2003 or 32 primarily due to repayment of outstanding commercial paper cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions capital expenditures and expansion marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 

  

 

accounts receivable decreased 5 million due to increased collection efforts given economic conditions inventories increased 35 million with additional levels needed to support customers obtained through acquisitions including omni and the conversion of omni customers to our product line additionally cintas is now manufacturing more products for our cleanroom and flame resistant clothing customers 

  

net property and equipment decreased by 1 million due to the excess of depreciation over capital expenditures certain capital expenditures were delayed in fiscal 2003 given reduced capacity requirements due to the sluggish economy in fiscal 2003 cintas completed construction of six new uniform rental facilities and had an additional six uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations 

  

total debt decreased 159 million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of omni net of the change in fair market value of the debt see note 5 entitled longterm debt of “notes to consolidated financial statements” this significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at may 31 2004 cintas had 254 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities representing an increase of 197 million from may 31 2003 this increase is primarily due to strong operational cash flows and a significant reduction in required inventory levels cash generated from operations was 510 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 331 million generated in fiscal 2003 this 179 million increase was primarily due to increased net income in fiscal 2004 and the significant reduction in inventory levels in fiscal 2003 inventory levels increased 35 million due to the acquisition of omni and the subsequent conversion of omni customers to the cintas product line additionally cintas began manufacturing more products for cleanroom and flame resistant clothing customers in fiscal 2004 inventory levels have decreased by 43 million through significant process improvements including six sigma initiatives and the consolidation of the omni product line partially offsetting the increased cash flow was cash used for acquisitions of 102 million other significant uses of cash in fiscal 2004 were debt repayments of 69 million adjusted for a 10 million change in derivatives capital expenditures of 113 million and dividends of 50 million 

  

cintas’ investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield is the criteria used in making investment decisions 

  

working capital increased 136 million to 709 million in fiscal 2004 this increase is primarily the result of increased cash and marketable securities partially offset by the decrease in inventories discussed above 

  

capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 totaled 113 million including 94 million for the rentals segment and 19 million for other services cintas continues to reinvest in land buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 will be between 130 and 150 million 

  

on may 13 2002 cintas completed the acquisition of omni for approximately 659 million this acquisition coupled with smaller acquisitions in both the rentals and other services segments were financed with a combination of approximately 109 million in cash 450 million in longterm notes and approximately 100 million in commercial paper as a result of this additional debt the total debt to total capitalization ratio was 34 at may 31 2002 significant debt repayments occurred in fiscal 2003 173 million and fiscal 2004 69 million the total debt to total capitalization ratio has decreased to 20 at may 31 2004 

  

the 450 million in longterm notes consist of 225 million with fiveyear maturities at a rate of 5125 and 225 million with tenyear maturities at a rate of 6 cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of “a” from standard  poor’s and “a2” from moody’s cintas also utilizes a 300 million commercial paper program on which it has earned credit ratings of “a1” from standard  poor’s and “prime1” from moody’s these ratings reflect cintas’ commitment to conservative financial policies strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions the commercial paper program is fully supported by a longterm credit facility that matures in 2009 as of may 31 2004 there is no commercial paper outstanding 

  

 

during the year cintas paid dividends of 50 million or 029 per share on a per share basis this dividend is an increase of 7 over the dividend paid in fiscal 2003

inflation and changing prices

management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas’ financial condition or a negative impact on operations 

  

 

litigation and environmental matters 

  

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business including personal injury customer contract environmental and employment claims in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of cintas cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business including the litigation discussed below 

  

cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit paul veliz et al v cintas corporation  filed on march 19 2003 in the united states district court northern district of california oakland division alleging that cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service sales representatives whom cintas considers exempt employees and asserting additional related erisa claims the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages injunctive relief or both cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations the court ordered arbitration for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four narrowly defined exceptions as a result cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be required to arbitrate their claims no determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class certification there can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or if a class is certified as to the geographic or other scope of such class if a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action the resulting liability andor any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to cintas any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time 

  

cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit robert ramirez et al v cintas corporation  filed on january 20 2004 and pending in the united states district court northern district of california san francisco division the case was brought on behalf of all past and present female africanamerican and hispanic employees of cintas and its subsidiaries the complaint alleges that cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment hiring promotions transfers job assignments and pay the complaint seeks injunctive relief compensatory damages punitive damages and attorney’s fees among other things cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations no filings or determination has been made as to class certification there can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or if a class is certified as to the geographic or other scope of such class if a court certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action the resulting liability andor any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to cintas any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time 

  

the litigation discussed above if decided adversely to or settled by cintas may result in liability material to cintas’ financial condition or results of operations cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of cintas’ shareholders 

  

cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the industry while costs related to environmental compliance are not a material component of the cost of rentals cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis environmental spending amounted to approximately 12 million in fiscal 2004 and 12 million in fiscal 2003 this spending includes labor and chemical costs for water treatment as well as costs for waste removal capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were 3 million in fiscal 2004 and 3 million in fiscal 2003 these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems 

  

 

new accounting standards 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51   the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity currently entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity cintas adopted this interpretation on july 1 2003 with no material effect to its financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148 sfas 148 accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure   this statement amends fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition this statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results cintas continues to apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 for the method used to account for stockbased employee compensation arrangements where applicable but has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas 148 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of cintas’ consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies in “notes to consolidated financial statements” significant changes estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer cintas also establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market substantially all inventories represent finished goods cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 

  

uniforms and other rental items in service 

  

uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization calculated using the straightline method uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months other rental items including shop towels mats cleanroom garments flame resistant garments linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to fortyeight months the amortization rates used are based on industry experience cintas’ experience and wear tests performed by cintas these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements 

  

 

property and equipment 

  

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings five to twenty years for building improvements three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is recorded the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate longlived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less estimated costs related to disposition 

  

goodwill and impairment 

  

goodwill primarily obtained through acquisitions of businesses is valued at cost less any impairment cintas performs an annual impairment test based on the results of the impairment tests cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may 31 2004 2003 or 2002 

  

service contracts and other assets 

  

service contracts and other assets which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses are amortized by use of the straightline method over the estimated lives of the agreements which are generally five to ten years certain noncompete agreements as well as all service contracts require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates among other factors because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets actual results over time could vary from original estimates 

  

environmental and litigation 

  

cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability as well as the amount to be recorded cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements a detailed discussion of litigation matters is included in note 12 entitled litigation and environmental matters of “notes to consolidated financial statements”

  

income taxes 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities please reference note 7 entitled income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as a result of this review cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets

  

cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions cintas records reserves for probable exposures based on cintas’ evaluation of current tax positions cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 

  

 

outlook 

  

as we look forward to fiscal 2005 our outlook is positive but guarded the economy has been gaining traction as employment figures strengthen our internal growth rates have been improving as well we see significant upside potential for all of our business units especially given our relatively low 9 market share of a 31 billion estimated potential market although difficult to predict we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units overall performance will be largely driven by the continued recovery in the economy 

  

in the marketplace competition and related pricing pressure will continue however we believe cost containment initiatives technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 

  

when appropriate opportunities arise we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 

  

like most other companies we experienced and anticipate continuing to experience increased costs for wages and benefits including medical benefits changes in oil and fuel costs also have the potential to impact our results 

  

cintas is currently the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees’ rights to a governmentsupervised election and unilaterally accept union representation this is unacceptable cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights 

  

we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure quality products financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success however a number of factors influence future revenue margins and profit which make forecasting difficult 

  




 item 7a  

quantitative and qualitative disclosure 

about market risk   

cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately 230 million with an average interest rate of 263 this exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in shortterm rates if shortterm rates change by onehalf percent or 50 basis points cintas’ income before taxes would change by approximately 11 million this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas’ capital structure

 item 1 business   cintas corporation is a publicly held company and is primarily a corporate identity uniform company which also provides ancillary services as discussed below cintas was founded in 1968 by richard t farmer chairman of the board when he left his familys industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric in the early 1970s cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business   cintas provides a highly specialized service to businesses of all types  from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services the rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents along with other items to its customers the other services operating segment involves the design manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its customers as well as the sale of ancillary services including sanitation supplies first aid and safety products and services and cleanroom supplies   the rental markets served by cintas are highly fragmented and competition for this business varies at each of cintas locations there are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of cintas although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms in certain instances local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of cintas in a particular market cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect its operations are quality service design and price in that order 

  the service provided to the rental markets served by cintas principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing ongoing uniform replacements as required to each customer cintas also offers ancillary products which includes the rental or sale of entrance mats fender covers towels mops linen products and first aid and safety products and services   due to its diverse customer base and average account size the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on cintas   in its sale of customized uniforms cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers   cintas operates fifteen manufacturing facilities which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs additional products are purchased from several outside suppliers because of cintas ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on cintas cintas purchases fabric used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials   cintas does not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material effect on its financial condition cintas is not aware of any material noncompliance with environmental laws

  in acquiring unitog in march 1999 cintas became a potentially responsible party and thus faces the possibility of joint and several liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act in connection with alleged environmental contamination in an area near a rental facility in tempe arizona this facility located near the south indian bend wash federal superfund site has been tested for soil and groundwater contamination soil testing at cintas facility detected volatile organic compounds and cintas promptly took steps to remediate the contamination groundwater testing in the area of cintas property has detected a very low level of volatile organic compound contamination the united states environmental protection agency in march 1999 issued a record of decision to the effect that groundwater contamination in the vicinity of cintas plant does not warrant remediation at this time instead the low levels of groundwater contamination near cintas facility will be monitored and allowed to attenuate naturally the record of decision requires active groundwater remediation in other parts of the site which are believed to be unrelated to cintas according to the record of decision the epa estimates that the 30 year net present value of costs to be incurred to remediate and monitor groundwater contamination at the site is 22 million it is possible that the epa will attempt to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs it has incurred to date with respect to the site as well as the costs it expects to incur going forward   as part of the agreement and plan of merger between unitog company and cintas cintas performed environmental testing at nine previously untested unitog laundry facilities the testing resulted in the discovery of soil and groundwater contamination at certain of these sites as a result of all of the environmental matters noted above cintas recorded a charge to operating expense of 5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 1999 to reflect its current estimate of the additional costs to be incurred relative to these sites at may 31 2001 cintas has an undiscounted liability of 46 million for these environmental matters   cintas is also a party to incidental litigation brought in the ordinary course of business none of which individually or in the aggregate is considered to be material to its operations or financial condition cintas maintains insurance coverage against certain liabilities that it may incur in its operations from time to time
